CLAIM

12 barrels containing human remains were found buried on the property of Bill and Hillary Clinton in June 2017.

FALSE

RATING

FALSE

ORIGIN

On 21 June 2017, the “satirical” web site Freedom Crossroads reported that 12 barrels containing human remains had been found on property owned by Bill and Hillary Clinton in upstate New York.

After the body parts of three women were found last night in a barrel unearthed from the garden area of the Clinton Estate in upstate New York, ground penetrating radar was brought in to analyze the entire property. Within a few hours, eleven more possible sites were pinpointed and excavation began. By dawn, 11 more identical steel 55-gallon drums were awaiting transport to Quantico with an immaculate chain of evidence. They will arrive and be opened later today.

The article, like everything published by Freedom Crossroads, is entirely fabricated. Buried at the bottom of its homepage, the web site includes a disclaimer:

We believe that there is nothing more precious than the mind of an aging conservative. Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate. Reality is often in the eye of the beholder. You won’t find any of it here.

This didn’t prevent the World Truth web site from republishing the story in earnest, along with the same photo of a barrel, which actually originates with a project undertaken by the Applied Geophysics Center at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

On the same day, similar versions of the fake story were also published by the News Feed Hunter web site (which added invented details such as the names of victims) and the Red Politics web site, which claimed three of the bodies found were those of three young women who disappeared while hitchhiking in 1974.

On its web site, Red Politics warns readers:

Sometimes the articles are satires and fake and we cannot make any warranties about the completeness, reliability and accuracy of this information.

The June 2017 “buried barrels” story is the latest distasteful chapter in a long saga of deaths and disappearances falsely attributed to or associated with the Clintons over the past few decades.

Iceland issued a travel ban against white Southern Baptists.

FALSE

RATING

FALSE

ORIGIN

On 6 June 2017, the web site Patheos published a satirical article saying that Iceland had issued a travel ban preventing white Southern Baptists from visiting the country:

This secular island country situated in the North Atlantic passed a law yesterday preventing white Southern Baptists from entering the country.Officials state that the United States of America is a country in turmoil and Southern Baptists are the ones mostly responsible. Atheist Iceland considers itself to be taking a stand for human rights by not tolerating foreign nationals who seek to undermine democracy.

Patheos largely focuses on religion and spirituality, but it also has a non-religious section that includes humor pieces. The particular piece was published in the Laughing in Disbelief section and linked to a disclaimer stating that the content was satirical:

CLAIM

An investigation has proven the presence of feces in Starbucks beverages.

FALSE

RATING

FALSE

ORIGIN

On 28 June 2017, the BBC teased an upcoming episode of their program Watchdog, an investigative series into consumer-related issues, with some scary-sounding revelations about coffee shops:

Ice from three of the UK’s biggest coffee chains has been found to contain bacteria from faeces, according to a BBC investigation. Samples of iced drinks from Costa Coffee, Starbucks and Caffe Nero contained varying levels of the bacteria, the BBC’s Watchdog found. […] At both Starbucks and Caffe Nero, three out of 10 samples tested contained the bacteria known as faecal coliforms.

The news, unlike the bacteria that inspired it, went viral nearly immediately. Some people took this BBC report as evidence of a widespread feces problem in Starbucks coffee. Others somehow interpreted this finding as an indictment of Starbucks’s alleged liberal politics. Bizarrely, some purveyors of vitriol tried to connect the report both to Muslims and to Starbucks’s pledge to hire refugees.

Importantly, however, what Watchdog found was not actually feces or fecal matter, but an extremely broad class of bacteria in 30 percent of the ten samples they took from a single Starbucks in the UK.

If you are looking to promote a television show with a viral story, a tried and true method is to perform the test Watchdog used — a fecal coliform assay — on everyday objects. This same approach convinced the internet that beards were poop-infested sanitation risks back in 2015. In response to that fecal hysteria, the Washington Post’s Rachel Feltman had this calming response:

The problem with this is that bacteria known to associate with poop is not necessarily literal poop. In fact it’s probably not. And saying that something is gross for being covered in bacteria is pretty ridiculous, because anything that exists in our physical realm is definitely going to be covered in bacteria. I have bad news for y’all: You’re covered in poo bacteria. COVERED. Look to your left, look to your right. There’s probably poo bacteria on both sides and also in front of you. It’s okay. It’s really fine. Embrace the poo bacteria, it is a part of you because you are a multitude of microorganisms, each more special than the last.

These words were just as relevant to beards then as they are to Starbucks ice cubes now. Indeed, the bacteria identified by a fecal coliform assay is not specific to feces, as a 2006 editorial published by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) pointed out in a piece arguing against using the test as a sole indicator of fecal matter:

Historically, the definition of fecal coliforms has been based on methods used for their detection. […] Several genera of bacteria [identified by a fecal coliform assay] are common contaminants of non-fecal sources (e.g., plant materials and pulp or paper mill effluents). Examples include Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Citrobacter species. Moreover, these bacteria which are false-positive indicators of fecal contamination can grow under appropriate conditions in nonfecal niches such as water, food, and waste.

In fact, the only bacteria included in the test that is exclusively found in feces is E. Coli., which the BBC’s Watchdog did not mention identifying (the ASM argues any fecal coliform test should be confirmed with a specific E. Coli test if one wants to demonstrate the presence of feces).

The expert the BBC quoted to heighten the fear of Starbucks ice was Tony Lewis, the Head of Policy for the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, which is described as “a campaigning organisation [that aims] to promote improvements in environmental and public health policy.” While the brief excerpts of him included in the BBC segment sound alarming, his full comments are a bit more reassuring:

It is important that those of us who enjoy our coffee and particular our iced drinks during the summer, do not panic. The issues identified in this case came from an extremely small sample and we have no reason to suspect that these findings will be the same everywhere.

Far from being definitive proof of poop in your Starbucks iced coffee, this “investigation” is more of a how-to on how to make a vague finding sensational in the lead up to a television episode.

On 6 June 2017, President Donald Trump posted a series of tweets that targeted the Gulf nation of Qatar amid an ongoing diplomatic crisis with neighboring countries — including Saudi Arabia, which Trump had recently visited:

So good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off. They said they would take a hard line on funding… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6, 2017

…extremism, and all reference was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6, 2017



The crisis started in late May 2017, when Qatar’s state-run news agency QNA posted remarks attributed to emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani that praised Iran and Israel and disparaged Trump. Shortly afterward, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with the country. The government of Qatar released a statement saying that QNA had been hacked, and that the statement by Al Thani wasn’t authentic:

The Qatar News Agency (QNA) website has been hacked by an unknown entity. A false statement attributed to His Highness has been published.

CNN reported on 6 June 2017 that Russian hackers attacked Qatar’s state news agency and produced the artificial statement:

US investigators believe Russian hackers breached Qatar’s state news agency and planted a fake news report that contributed to a crisis among the US’ closest Gulf allies, according to US officials briefed on the investigation. The FBI recently sent a team of investigators to Doha to help the Qatari government investigate the alleged hacking incident, Qatari and US government officials say.

Although Russian hackers have been accused of interfering with the 2016 U.S. election and the French election in 2017, Malcolm Nance, an intelligence expert and former counterterrorism officer with the United States government, told us the current Gulf crisis appears to have roots that stretch back beyond the “fake news” that appeared on QNA’s web site, pointing to hacked e-mails between officials from conservative think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) and the Emirates ambassador to the U.S., Yousef Al-Otaiba. Nance told us:

I don’t believe this came from [fake news] and if anyone’s saying that, it’s a convenient way to say, “now we have a reason to defuse this crisis.” I think Donald Trump gave away the game with his two tweets where he said he was part of the planning at this Saudi conference.

The hacked e-mails show a campaign to isolate Qatar by Al-Otaiba, an influential figure in Washington, D.C. Some of the e-mails were obtained by the Huffington Post, which reported:

Otaiba, one of the most powerful diplomats in Washington, figures in an unfolding regional crisis centered on U.S. partner nation Qatar, which hosts America’s largest military base in the region. The UAE and three other U.S.-aligned Middle East governments ratcheted up a simmering dispute with Qatar on Sunday night when they cut diplomatic and transportation ties to the Gulf nation over its support of the transnational Muslim Brotherhood and alleged assistance to Iran-backed militants around the region. … The leaked emails, which show Otaiba’s comments during a yearlong campaign to discredit Qatar in the U.S., threaten the UAE’s hope to win official American blessing for its pressure campaign against the Qataris. Trump is notoriously thin-skinned: He has banned people who publicly criticized him from his team (including GOP consigliere Elliott Abrams, a fellow Qatar skeptic who is friends with Otaiba) and seems unable to get over slights even years after they occur. And his administration already seems disinclined to pick a side. Top officials like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis have emphasized the importance of resolving the dispute.

Amid the tensions and maneuvering, the Financial Times reported it was a $1 billion ransom payment by the Qatari government in April 2017 to militant groups to free members of the royal family who had been apprehended on a hunting trip in Iraq, which ended up being the catalyst to the current falling out:

The deal, which was concluded in April, heightened concerns among Qatar’s neighbours about the small gas-rich state’s role in a region plagued by conflict and bitter rivalries. And on Monday, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain took the extraordinary step of cutting off diplomatic ties and transport links to Qatar, alleging the country fuels extremism and terrorism.

Nance said the risk of Trump’s decision to pick sides in the fight is that Qatar could potentially ask the U.S. — which has Al Udeid Air Base and 11,000 military personnel in the country — to leave.

German lawmakers voted Friday to legalize same-sex marriage, a move widely supported across the country that brings Germany in line with many of its Western peers. Chancellor Angela Merkel voted against the measure, but paved the way for its passage by allowing members of her conservative party to vote according to their conscience.

Lawmakers voted 393-226 to legalize “marriage for everybody,” with four abstentions. Underlining the delicate political tightrope that Merkel walked, the “no” votes came entirely from her conservative bloc, although some prominent party members, including Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen and her chief of staff Peter Altmaier, voted for it.

“This is a historic day,” said Greens lawmaker Volker Beck, who leapt to his feet to applaud once the result was announced and was showered with confetti by supporters.

“It is really an amazing victory,” said Beck, who has campaigned around Europe for gay rights.

Gay couples outside the chancellery, not far from parliament, kissed and hugged after the decision was announced, waving rainbow flags and carrying signs saying “Marriage for everybody.”

“We’ve been happily married for eight years, but we could never call it that,” said 38-year-old Shoshana Brandt, standing alongside her partner and their son. “We are happy and proud that we are now equal and we can live our love.”

After years of lukewarm opposition to gay marriage following her party’s line, Merkel said Monday that lawmakers could take up the issue as a question of “conscience,” allowing members of her conservative coalition to individually vote for it if they wanted.

That prompted her center-left rivals to call for a quick vote on the issue, adding it to the agenda Friday on parliament’s last regular session before Germany’s Sept. 24 national election.

Berlin Christian Democrat Jan-Marco Luczak, one of 75 lawmakers from Merkel’s bloc who voted for the measure, urged his fellow party members to join him.

“It would be absurd to try and protect marriage by preventing people to marry,” he told lawmakers in the debate ahead of the vote.

Many applauded Merkel’s comments that opened the way for the vote, but Social Democrat lawmaker Johannes Kahrs noted that the chancellor has been a longtime opponent of gay marriage.

“Many thanks for nothing,” he said bluntly.

Germany has allowed same-sex couples to enter civil partnerships since 2001, but has not granted them full marital rights, which include the possibility of jointly adopting children, even though gay marriage enjoyed some 80 percent support, according to recent polls.

More than a dozen countries in Europe have legalized gay marriage, all in the western part of the continent, and Germany had been the largest where it was not yet legal. Almost a dozen others have some sort of same-sex unions or civil partnerships, according to the Pew Research Center.

Amnesty International praised the law as a “victory for equality.”

“Germany has become the 23rd country to recognize same-sex marriage and has sent a clear message to the world that gay and lesbian people should be entitled to the same rights as everyone else, and to full and equal protection of the law,” Amnesty’s Europe director John Dalhuisen said.

The new law won’t take effect for several months because it still needs to pass the upper house of parliament and be approved by the president, although those are formalities. It is also expected to face legal challenges.

Merkel told reporters later that her vote against the measure was based upon her reading of the country’s law concerning marriage but added that she did think gay couples should be able to adopt.

Germany’s constitution is vague, saying only that “marriage and the family shall enjoy the protection of the state,” but Merkel said that for her, “marriage as defined by the law is the marriage of a man and a woman.” Still, she urged all views to be respected.

“It was a long, intensive, and for many also an emotional discussion. That goes for me personally too. And I’m hopeful not only that there will be respect for either side’s opinions, but that it will also bring about more peace and cohesion in society,” she said.

All of Merkel’s potential coalition partners after the September election, including the center-left Social Democrats of her challenger, Martin Schulz, have been calling for same-sex marriage to be legalized.

Analysts have suggested that by opening the door to gay marriage, Merkel removed yet another issue that her opponents could have used against her in an election year — a nod to her pragmatic approach to politics.

In her nearly 12 years as chancellor, Merkel has moved her party to the center and away from conservative orthodoxy, speeding up Germany’s exit from nuclear power and ending military conscription, among other moves.

A high-profile legal battle by the parents of 10-month-old Charlie Gard appears to have come to an end. On 27 June, a European Court refused to intervene in the case, which saw the High Court of England and Wales rule that the infant — who suffers from an extremely rare mitochondrial disease — should be taken off life support and die in hospital.

According to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, where Gard is a patient, the boy suffers from infantile-onset encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (also known as MDDS). He has severe brain damage and progressive muscular weakness, and cannot move or breathe unaided. He cannot hear or see, and is unlikely to be able to develop either ability.

As a result, doctors at Great Ormond Street believe it is in his own best interest to receive palliative care, rather than keep him on life support and in March 2017, they applied to the High Court of England and Wales for permission to withdraw life support.

At present, there is no established effective cure for MDDS, and doctors at the hospital therefore regard the condition as terminal. However, Charlie’s parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates from Bedfont, West London, have raised $1.7 million (£1.3 million) for experimental nucleoside treatment in the United States.

The treatment has never been tried before on humans, and the American doctor who expressed a willingness to treat Charlie told the High Court “…It is very unlikely that he will improve with that therapy.”

In April 2017, the High Court ruled that it was in Charlie’s best interest for life support to be ended. Having heard expert testimony from several witnesses, Justice Nicholas Francis wrote in his judgement:

The prospect of the nucleoside treatment having any benefit is as close to zero as makes no difference. In other words, as I have already said, it is futile.

Justice Francis concluded:

As the Judge whose sad duty it is to have to make this decision, I know that this is the darkest day for Charlie’s parents who have done everything that they possibly can for him and my heart goes out to them as I know does the heart of every person who has listened to this tragic case during the course of the past week or so. I can only hope that in time they will come to accept that the only course now in Charlie’s best interests is to let him slip away peacefully and not put him through more pain and suffering.

Charlie’s parents appealed the ruling unsuccessfully several times — first with the Court of Appeals of England and Wales, then with the United Kingdom Supreme Court. Finally, the couple took the case to the European Court of Human Rights, arguing (among other points) that Charlie’s right to life was being violated.

However, the court in Strasbourg, France, ultimately ruled that the imperative to act in Charlie’s best interests and not prolong his suffering outweighed the vanishingly small likelihood of successful treatment. On 27 June, Charlie’s parents’ application was ruled inadmissible and rejected.

In a 29 June 2017 video message, Charlie’s mother, Connie Yates, claimed that the couple had expressed a longstanding wish to bring him home to die in the event that he was denied treatment, but that Great Ormond Street Hospital would not allow them to do so. She said the infant was likely to be taken off life support and die in the hospital the following day.

We’ve been talking with Great Ormond Street since November last year – when they first started talking about court – about what palliative care meant, and we had three options: one option was to let Charlie go in hospital; the other option was to let Charlie go to a hospice; and the third option was to let Charlie go home to die. So we chose to take Charlie home to die and we have said this for months, that that is what we want. That is our last wish, if it went this way, the way it’s gone. And we promised our little boy, every single day, that we would take him home, because that is a promise we thought we could keep.

Chris Gard, Charlie’s father, added that after the European Court of Human Rights decision, the couple reiterated to the hospital their wish to bring Charlie home to die or to take him to a hospice if that was not possible. Both preferences were rejected by the hospital, according to Gard.

They said no to both. He has to die in that hospital tomorrow [30 June 2017].

The boy’s parents also claimed that the hospital refused their request to delay removing life support until members of their extended family can pay a final visit to Charlie. Connie Yates claimed: “We’ve literally begged them today to give us this weekend.”

Chris Gard added:

Some of our family and friends can’t come. They can’t come before tomorrow. So the last time they saw Charlie will be the last time they ever see him.

When we contacted Great Ormond Street Hospital for a response to these allegations, a spokesperson said in a statement:

Together with Charlie’s parents we are putting plans in place for his care, and to give them more time together as a family.

According to the BBC, Connie Yates previously stated that if she and her partner were not allowed to take Charlie to the U.S. for the experimental treatment, they would put the money donated to them by members of the public toward helping other children with mitochondrial disease.

“If Charlie doesn’t get this chance, we will make sure that other innocent babies and children will be saved,” she reportedly said in a GoFundMe post that has since been deleted.

President Donald Trump crowned his weekend rage against the news media with a mock video that shows him pummeling a man in a business suit — his face obscured by the CNN logo — outside a wrestling ring.

It was not immediately clear who produced the brief video, which appears to be a doctored version of Trump’s 2007 appearance on World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. The 28-second clip was posted on Trump’s official Twitter account Sunday morning, with the message: “#FraudNewsCNN #FNN.”

Trump, who has branded the media as the “opposition party” and CNN as “fake news,” stayed on the attack later in the day, stating on Twitter that “the dishonest media will NEVER keep us from accomplishing our objectives on behalf of our GREAT AMERICAN PEOPLE!”

On Monday, he continued the attacks on Twitter: “At some point the Fake News will be forced to discuss our great jobs numbers, strong economy, success with ISIS, the border & so much else!”

At some point the Fake News will be forced to discuss our great jobs numbers, strong economy, success with ISIS, the border & so much else! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2017

Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, condemned the video as a “threat of physical violence against journalists.” He said Trump’s tweet was “beneath the office of the presidency.”

A White House aide insisted the tweet should not send a chill across the media landscape.

“I think that no one would perceive that as a threat,” homeland security adviser Tom Bossert said. “I hope they don’t. But I do think that he’s beaten up in a way on cable platforms that he has a right to respond to.”

CNN accused Trump of engaging in “juvenile behavior far below the dignity of his office.”

White House officials traveling with Trump during his weekend stay at his New Jersey golf club did not immediately respond to questions about the video. It appeared to be a doctored version of an appearance Trump made on a World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. show called “Battle of the Billionaires” in 2007, in which Trump appears to attack WWE CEO Vince McMahon.

McMahon’s wife, Linda, who founded and built the company with her husband, now heads the Small Business Administration for Trump and was a donor to his campaign.

The video was posted several days ago by a Reddit user with the title, “Trump takes down fake news.” It was not clear whether that was where it originated or how Trump found it. Still, the user wrote Sunday about being “honored” Trump had tweeted the video. The user who posted the video has a history of posts using anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant language.

The president’s verbal shots against news outlets and individual members of the media have grown increasingly personal in recent days even as lawmakers in both parties say the insults only threaten to undermine his political agenda.

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is defending his use of a beach closed to the public during New Jersey’s government shutdown, saying he had previously announced his vacation plans and the media had simply “caught a politician keeping his word.”

The Republican governor was photographed Sunday by NJ.com at Island Beach State Park sitting on a beach chair in sandals and a T-shirt before flying to talk to reporters in Trenton.

Christie told WTXF-TV in Philadelphia on Monday that he had earlier said he planned to be at the state-owned governor’s beach house regardless of whether there was a shutdown.

He said the media “caught a politician keeping his word” and added New Jersey “has beaches for 120 miles” so there are plenty of options for anyone wanting a beach day as the Fourth of July approaches.

New Jersey’s budget stalemate between Republican Gov. Chris Christie and the Democrat-controlled Legislature is smoldering with the state government shut down and state parks closed to the public as the Fourth of July approaches.

Christie said he’d sign any budget lawmakers sent to him and blamed the shutdown of nonessential services on Democratic Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto.

Christie said he’d consider the Democratic budget along with legislation to overhaul the state’s biggest health insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield. He said without the Horizon legislation he has called for he’d line item veto $350 million of the Democratic priorities.

Prieto is holding open a deadlocked vote on the Assembly floor on the $34.7 billion budget.

At least twenty states have signaled resistance or rejected a request from President Donald Trump’s administration for data for every registered voter in the U.S.

The request was submitted via letters to all secretary of state offices in the nation and the District of Columbia by the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity on 29 June 2017, seeking information that includes the names, party affiliations, addresses, military statuses and the last four digits of the voters’ Social Security numbers, as well as voting history from 2006 onward.

Kris Kobach, the commission’s vice-chair and current Kansas secretary of state, has claimed in the past, as has Trump, that U.S. voter fraud is widespread — but without providing evidence. Trump signed an executive order creating the commission in May 2017, which quickly spurred accusations that it would be used to implement, rather than investigate, voter suppression.

Ten states — California, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Virginia — have fully rebuked Kobach’s call for voter data, including an invitation from Mississippi Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann in a statement of his own:

They can go jump in the Gulf of Mexico and Mississippi is a great State to launch from. Mississippi residents should celebrate Independence Day and our State’s right to protect the privacy of our citizens by conducting our own electoral processes.

Even Kobach’s home state of Kansas balked, prompting backtracking from his office:

“In Kansas, the Social Security number is not publicly available. … Every state receives the same letter, but we’re not asking for it if it’s not publicly available,” Kobach said. He did not rule out the possibility of providing that information to the commission in the future. “If the commission decides that they would like to receive Social Security numbers to a secure site in order to remove false positives, then we would have to double check and make sure Kansas law permits,” Kobach said. “I know for a fact that this information would be secured and maintained confidentially,” he added in response to security concerns.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) made reference to the allegations that led Trump to create the commission in a statement:

New York refuses to perpetuate the myth voter fraud played a role in our election. We will not be complying with this request and I encourage the Election Commission to work on issues of vital importance to voters, including ballot access, rather than focus on debunked theories of voter fraud.

Several other states have responded by saying that they will only share information that is already publicly available.

Voter advocacy groups have also come out against the commission’s push for access to the data, which it said it wanted by 14 July 2017. League of Women Voters president Chris Carson said in a statement that her group would support any state that refused to comply with Kobach’s request:

There is no justification for this giant fishing expedition. The Commission itself is a distraction from the real issue of voter suppression, and that efforts to “investigate voter fraud” threaten our most fundamental voting rights. This most recent move by Mr. Kobach is an indicator that the so-called Election “Integrity” Commission is not interested in facts, but false accusations and dangerous policy recommendations.

The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law also condemned Kobach’s letters and called on his counterparts in other states to “discourage state and local officials” from participating in the commission’s activities:

This meritless inquisition opens the door for a misguided and ill-advised Commission to take steps to target and harass voters and could lead to purging of the voter rolls.

Kobach has not elaborated on how information collected by the commission would be kept safe.

Before joining Trump’s administration, Kobach worked as an attorney for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a hardline anti-immigration group. In September 2016, a federal appeals court found that Kobach had provided “precious little” evidence that non-U.S. citizens were engaging in voter fraud.

CLAIM

Germany's Black Forest caused 15,000 missing person cases last year.

FALSE

RATING

FALSE

ORIGIN

A photograph purportedly showing Germany’s Black Forest is frequently circulated on social media along with the claim that the wooded area “caused” 15,000 missing persons cases last year:



There are a number problems with this meme.

For one, a forest can’t “cause” a person to go missing. This phrasing likely derives from the Black Forest’s reputation as a haunted area (in large part due to its association with the Brothers Grimm fairy tales).

The earliest posting of the meme we found was from August 2014, on CreepyPasta, a Facebook page that specializes in spooky (albeit fictional) short stories. The page describes itself as “a series of fictional and non-fictional stories that are posted on the Internet and are designed to unnerve and shock the reader.”

Furthermore, the image displayed with the claim doesn’t actually show the storied forest. The Black Forest, or Schwarzwald, is in southwestern Germany. But this photograph shows Hameln, Germany, which is in the center of the country.

The Black Forest is outlined in green on the map (left) and the city of Hameln is marked in red (right).

Jonathan Manshack took the photograph, which National Geographic chose as the Photo of the Day on 11 June 2011:

This photo was taken during autumn in Hameln, Germany, which is the birthplace of the infamous Rattenfänger—or Pied Piper, as we Americans know it. This shot is actually on top of the last few hills that soon sink into the state of Niedersachsen (Lower Saxony). This area is essentially lowland plains—hence the name Lower Saxony!

There’s also no basis for the claim that 15,000 people went missing in 2013 — or any other year — in the Black Forest.Germany’s Initiative on Missing Children did not mention the forest as an area of particular concern, nor the The European Child Rescue Alert and Police Network on Missing Children.

15,000 is such an astronomically high number that the meme is clearly inaccurate. To give you an idea, The Bundeskriminalamt, Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office, in its report on missing persons, said that a total of 6,400 people were missing in Germany in 2007 — and that number included cases that were as many as 30 years old.

If the meme were true, that would mean that almost three times as many people had gone missing in one small area of the country in 2013, an event that would warrant both major media coverage and a large-scale criminal investigation. We found evidence of neither.

NEW YORK (AP) — A doctor who used to work at a Bronx hospital returned with a rifle hidden under his white lab coat and opened fire Friday, killing one person and wounding six others before apparently taking his own life, authorities said.

The gunfire broke out at 2:50 p.m. inside the Bronx Lebanon Hospital, drawing police cars and firetrucks to the scene and sending officers onto the roof with their guns drawn as people inside the building were told to hide.

Officers went floor by floor looking for the gunman and reported just before 4 p.m. that the shooter was dead inside the building. A law enforcement official told The Associated Press that the gunman apparently killed himself.

He was identified by law enforcement officials as Dr. Henry Bello, a family medicine physician at the hospital. It was not immediately clear why he was no longer working at the hospital. The officials were not authorized to discuss the still-unfolding investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Emergency crews had been kept from going inside the hospital while the shooter was at large.

Garry Trimble said his wife, hospital employee Denise Brown, called him from inside the hospital shortly after 3 p.m.

“She woke me up and told me there was a situation, somebody’s out there shooting people,” Trimble said as he waited for his wife to come out. “I could hear in her voice she was shaking and about to cry.”

Gonzalo Carazo described the scary scene to WCBS-TV. “I saw one of the doctors and he had a gunshot wound to his hand,” Carazo said.

“All I heard was a doctor saying, “Help, help!” Carazo locked himself in a room for about 15 minutes until police came and led him out of the hospital.

The 120-year-old hospital has nearly 1,000 beds and one of the busiest emergency rooms in New York City. It is about a mile and a half north of Yankee Stadium.

In 2011, two people were shot at Bronx Lebanon in what police said was a gang-related attack.

CLAIM

A fisherman captured a 3,000 lb. great white shark in the Great Lakes.

FALSE

RATING

FALSE

ORIGIN

On 20 June 2016, the web site World News Daily Report (WNDR) published an article reporting that a fisherman made an astounding catch, pulling a a 3,000-lb. great white shark out of the waters of Lake Michigan:

The capture of a 3,000-pound great white shark in Lake Michigan yesterday could explain the disappearance of hundreds of missing people in the region in the last decade, has confirmed the U.S. Coast Guard this morning. John O’Keefe, a Canadian tourist, captured the 3,000-pound beast while fishing for sturgeon in Michigan Lake. “We reeled in the beast for a good 4-5 hours before we finally shot it and wounded it to the head” explains the Toronto resident on vacation. “Luckily, I had my rifle in hand, or else this prize fish would’ve never been caught” claims his friend, a long-time resident of Chicago, Allan Brooks.

The article also suggested that the Great Lakes shark was suspected in a number of unexplained disappearances, incidents that supposedly went unreported by the media because they might adversely impact tourism:

Authorities suspect that more than a hundred people reported missing in the area in the last decade may have fallen under the fangs of the gigantic beast, several local residents even suspecting its presence for a long time. “I’ve owned this campground for the past seventeen years” explains local entrepreneur, Robert Helm. “I’ve had my load of visitors disappearing mysteriously over the years, but I was told not to say anything about it. People would check in, but they wouldn’t check out,” he recalls. “Nobody ever believed me anyway and it would’ve scared away the tourists,” he told local reporters. “It would’ve been bad for business in town” he adds, visibly relieved since the capture of the large creature.

However, this report was nothing more than another fabricated story from a fake news web site.

Great white sharks cannot swim in freshwater lakes, and the image used by World News Daily Report to illustrate their fabrication dates to at least 2013 (and thus is clearly unconnected to any shark capture occurring in June 2016).

World News Daily Report creates fake, outlandish stories published alongside unrelated photographs, racking up ad revenue via social media shares. The site’s disclaimer clearly states that WNDR‘s articles are “satirical” and “fictional”:

CLAIM

The body of a homeless man found in San Diego has been identified as that of Elvis Presley.

FALSE

RATING

FALSE

ORIGIN

On 31 January 2015, the Empire News web site published an article reporting that the body of a homeless man discovered in San Diego had been found through DNA testing to be that of singer Elvis Presley:

Earlier this month, an 80-year-old, homeless, white-bearded man was found deceased under an overpass in San Diego, California. Nobody knew the man’s name, but friends referred to him as Jessie, so investigators decided to try DNA testing with hopes that something would pop up in the nationwide DNA database. What popped up on the computer screen in the high-tech lab stunned everyone. The DNA results of ‘Jessie Doe’ were an exact match to the one and only, Elvis Aaron Presley. Lab technician Robert Brensdale said he and his lab assistant, Madeline Hedgespeth, laughed when the name popped up. “We thought somebody, somewhere, somehow in the system pulled the greatest and most elaborate prank on us ever, we both laughed with hysteria for about an hour,” Brensdale told Jerry Hardin of the Hollywood Word, a new entertainment publication based out of Los Angeles.

Soon afterwards links and excerpts referencing this article were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered the item mistaking it for a genuine news article. However, the report was just a spoof of the ubiquitous “Elvis is alive” and “Elvis faked his death” rumors that have circulated ever since the singer passed away in August 1977, accompanied by an artificial rendering of what an elderly Elvis might look like.

The spoof was published by the Empire News, a fake news web site that issues fictional stories such as “Cure for Cancer Discovered; ‘Amazingly Simple’ Says Researcher,” and “College Student Excused from Classes After Dog Eats Grandmother,” and “Woman Gives Birth, Confuses Doctors by Asking for Maternity Test.”

The site’s disclaimer notes that “Empire News is intended for entertainment purposes only.”

CLAIM

A new analysis of the residue on common American foods showed high levels of the herbicide glyphosate and Monsanto, the EPA, and the FDA are in cahoots to silence word of the chemical’s harmful effects and its high concentration in foods. See Example(s)

EXAMPLES

FALSE

RATING

FALSE

ORIGIN

On 15 November 2016, the natural food evangelist and alternative health guru known as the Food Babe posted a report from a natural food activist group named Food Democracy Now that alleged to demonstrate common American foods contain high levels of glyphosate, a chemical in Monsanto’s RoundUp herbicide and the most prevalent weed-killer on the planet.

Her post and the report it highlights are a new addition to contentious political debate about the chemical’s harm to humans and the environment, as well as the potential influence of large companies like Monsanto on regulatory agencies, that has been ongoing for decades.

Glyphosate is widely applied to crops around the world — especially genetically modified crops specifically bred to be resistant to the chemical, per the National Pesticide Information Center:

Glyphosate is an herbicide. It is applied to the leaves of plants to kill both broadleaf plants and grasses. The sodium salt form of glyphosate is used to regulate plant growth and ripen fruit. Glyphosate was first registered for use in the U.S. in 1974. Glyphosate is one of the most widely used herbicides in the United States. People apply it in agriculture and forestry, on lawns and gardens, and for weeds in industrial areas. Some products containing glyphosate control aquatic plants.

Regulatory agencies have gone back and forth on its safety ever since it was registered for use. The idea, which has been verified by observations, is that glyphosate runs off into the water supply, where it can be ingested directly, or consumed after it leaves a residue on food.

The first assessment of glyphosate’s carcinogenic potential was undertaken by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 1985. Based on studies done primarily with rodents, they classified the chemical as “a Group C (Possibly Carcinogenic to Humans: Agents with limited animal evidence and little or no human data) carcinogen” in 1986. After a series of additional investigations, which included industry sponsored studies, the EPA reclassified the chemical in 1993 as “Group E carcinogen (signifies evidence of non-carcinogenicity in humans).”

A majority of the data used to demonstrate evidence of harm comes from studies in which environmentally unrealistic concentrations of glyphosate were exposed to rats, mice, and fish. Some recent studies have demonstrated potentially adverse effects at low exposure levels but the validity of these results have been called into question by other researchers.

Although a March 2015 review by the WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer suggested glyphosate may have some carcinogenic potential, the current consensus amongst the world’s regulatory agencies is that it is safe for consumption and non-carcinogenic at environmentally relevant levels, with the WHO concluding:

Glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through the diet.

Still, a 2014 report from the US Government Accountability Office compelled the FDA to set up an initiative to monitor food for glyphosate residue, a decision met by praise by environmentalists and food activists. As reported by the Huffington Post’s Carey Gillam, however, the effort was halted due to a lack of agreement on standardizing the analyses:

The FDA’s residue testing for glyphosate was combined with a broader herbicides analysis program the FDA set in motion in February of this year. But the glyphosate testing has been particularly challenging for the FDA. The agency was finally forced to put the glyphosate residue testing part of the work plan on hold amid confusion, disagreement and difficulties with establishing a standard methodology to use across the agency’s multiple U.S. laboratories, according to FDA sources. Equipment issues have also been a problem, with some labs citing a need for more sensitive instruments, sources within FDA said.

This is where the Food Babe’s unsubstantiated narrative comes into the picture. Based primarily on the fact that the FDA canceled its residue testing program, along with results from various studies performed on animals, she alleges a nefarious connection between the FDA and Monsanto, the developer of the RoundUp:

When it comes to the FDA, they are not protecting the American public from glyphosate either. After announcing in February that they would FINALLY begin testing foods for glyphosate residues, they just decided to suspend their testing this week. Could it be that Monsanto didn’t like the results they started getting – especially since the FDA found glyphosate in foods that should be especially safe like BABY FOOD? Monsanto will do whatever it takes to keep that story out of the public eye.

While there are conflicts of interest arguments to be made about the use of industry sponsored studies or petitions to influence regulators, there is no evidence to suggest the FDA halted its testing program in response to pressure from Monsanto.

Instead of providing evidence of the alleged connection, the Food Babe presented the results of non-peer reviewed lab tests performed on various food items at the behest of the activist group Food Democracy Now and the research platform The Detox Project, alleging it exposed high levels of the herbicide on common foods:

A FDA-registered food safety laboratory tested iconic American food for residues of the weed killer glyphosate (aka Monsanto’s Roundup) and found ALARMING amounts. Just to give you an idea of how outrageous these amounts are, independent research shows that probable harm to human health begins at really low levels of exposure – at only 0.1 ppb of glyphosate. Many foods were found to have over 1,000 times this amount! Well above what regulators throughout the world consider “safe”.

The statement about 0.1 ppb being the lower limit for harm to human health is controversial, as only one of the studies listed as providing support for that claim actually tested an amount that low; the test was performed on mice, not humans, and it used the word “potential”, not “probable”.

It is also important to note that many of the results they reported are actually marked with the note that they “may not represent an accurate representation of the sample.”

The lab results commissioned by Food Democracy Now claimed to show residue values on common American foods that were well above 0.1 ppb; but the methods employed are not elucidated, and its important to remember that the FDA limit is four orders of magnitude greater than the threshold they claim.

A final point to note is that the report was commissioned by two groups with a stated agenda, as declared in its introduction:

The testing and analysis was performed at the request of FOOD DEMOCRACY NOW!, in coordination with THE DETOX PROJECT, which gathered additional scientific evidence from around the world and included a compendium of independent research on glyphosate.

According to their website, “Food Democracy Now! is a grassroots community dedicated to building a sustainable food system that protects our natural environment, sustains farmers and nourishes families.”

The Detox Project is a research initiative that is currently focused specifically on glyphosate, according to their mission statement:

Glyphosate, the world’s most used herbicide, is the first chemical being tested by The Detox Project. We aim to study all of the most common man-made chemicals in our environment over the next few years […] to protect women and children from the harmful effects of man-made chemicals in our food and in our environment.

There is no evidence to suggest the FDA shut down its residue program due to complaints from Monsanto. While scientists and regulators have and continue to debate methods for assessing and testing potential harm from glyphosate, the broad scientific consensus is that it is not a risk; and the un-reviewed results of a questionable laboratory exercise do not change that assessment.

An angry Italy summoned Austria’s ambassador after the government in Vienna announced it was ready to re-introduce border controls and deploy troops and armored vehicles along the border to block any migrant influx out of Italy. Austrian Defence Minister Hans Peter Doskozil told Kronen Zeitung daily that troops could go to the Brenner Pass and that four Pandur armoured personnel carriers had been sent to the Tyrol region with 750 troops were on standby.

“We need to prepare for the migration development in Italy, and I expect very promptly that border controls will have to be activated and assistance requested,” Hans Peter Doskozil told the online edition of the Krone daily, adding that a military deployment at the busy Alpine pass would be “indispensable if the influx into Italy [across the Mediterranean] does not diminish”. While Austria has border checks with Hungary and Slovenia, elsewhere – such as on the border with Italy – it adheres to the EU open borders system.

Doskozil explained that “these are not battle tanks. These are armored vehicles without weapons which could block roads. These were already used during the refugee crisis 201/16 at the Spielfeld border crossing [with Slovenia],” just in case Italy got the impression that its northern neighbor was preparing to invade.

The border controls will include the Alpine Brenner pass, which forms the border between Austria and Italy, one of the main mountain passes in the eastern Alps. There isn’t a strict time plan for the step-up in border security, but, according to Doskozil’s spokesman, “we see how the situation in Italy is becoming more acute and we have to be prepared to avoid a situation comparable to summer 2015” according to Reuters.

Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz said that Vienna is prepared to “protect” the frontier with Italy “if necessary,” as he spoke with the Austria Press Agency. Later Italy’s foreign ministry said it had summoned Austrian Ambassador Rene Pollitzer “following the Austrian government’s statement about deploying troops to the Brenner (pass)”.

The latest turmoil inside Europe’s customs union comes two years after Germany admitted over a million mostly Syrian migrants, as part of Angela Merkel’s “Open Door” (since shut) welcome, and just days after Italy’s interior minister demanded other EU nations “step up” and relieve Italy of the sudden flood of inbound migrants.

The Italian governor of South Tyrol, Arno Kompatscher, sought to defuse tensions. According to BBC, he said Austria had issued similar warnings about the border previously, and the situation there remained “quiet and stable”. Austria was gearing up for a general election in October, Mr Kompatscher noted. The anti-immigration Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) is expected to poll strongly.

People-smuggling gangs have been exploiting the violence and chaos in Libya. The shortest crossing from Libya to Italy is only about 460km (290 miles). Nearly 85,000 migrants and refugees arrived in Italy in the first half of this year, across the Mediterranean. The UN refugee agency UNHCR says that is about 20% more than in the first half of 2016.

To be sure, the UN joined Italy’s appeal, with Vincent Cochetel, the UNHCR’S special envoy for the central Mediterranean, saying that “this is not sustainable. We need to have other countries joining Italy and sharing that responsibility.” So far, nobody in the European “Union” has stepped up to “share the responsibility” of Europe’s generous refugee acceptance program.

The latest report by the UNHCR, revealed another troubling statistics: few of the migrants coming to Europe will granted asylum: 30% of them are fleeing conflict or persecution, while 70% of those arriving in Italy are economic migrants. Most migrants and refugees are young, single men with little or no education, and almost 15% are unaccompanied minors.

Meanwhile, Italy has also warned that the current scale of migrant arrivals is unsustainable and that it could even close its ports and impound aid agencies’ rescue ships. In other words, yet another refugee crisis in Europe is imminent.

It will be the second time this has happened in two years. In 2015, the EU’s Schengen system, or the free movement across most European borders, was overwhelmed by an influx of migrants and refugees, whoe reached Central Europe via the Balkans, and most sought asylum in Germany. Since then, tighter border controls in the Balkans have reduced the numbers heading north from Greece. Most of the influx to Austria was via Hungary. Many of those who came by train or on foot were refugees from Syria, Iraq and other conflict zones.

So far 101,000 migrants have entered Europe in 2017 via the Mediterranean and according to the latest figures, 2,247 people have died or are missing at sea.

EU antitrust regulators are weighing another record fine against Google over its Android mobile operating system and have set up a panel of experts to give a second opinion on the case, two people familiar with the matter said.

Assuming the panel agrees with the initial case team’s conclusions, it could pave the way for the European Commission to issue a decision against Alphabet’s (GOOGL.O) Google by the end of the year.

The Commission in April last year charged Google with using its dominant Android mobile operating system to shut out rivals following a complaint by lobby group FairSearch, U.S.-based ad-blocking and privacy firm Disconnect Inc, Portuguese apps store Aptoide and Russia’s Yandex (YNDX.O).

The move by the EU competition authority, which hit the company with a 2.4 billion euro ($2.7 billion) penalty for unfairly favoring its shopping service last month, could pose a bigger risk for the world’s most popular internet search engine because of Android’s huge growth potential.

In the coming days, Iraqi counterterrorism forces are expected to assault the remaining ISIS stronghold in Tal Afar—roughly 40 miles west of Mosul—according to the commander of Iraq’s Joint Military Operations, Lieutenant General Abdel Amir Rashid Yarallah, who spoke to Iraqi media July 4.

“Tal Afar is the next point of liberation with the participation of all military units,” Yarallah said.

“The Turkmen-dominated city of Tal Afar is completely encircled by Turkmen Shia militia and Peshmerga forces,” the leader of the 10,000-man Turkmen Shia Popular Mobilization Forces told Free Beacon Sunday. Abu Retha al Najjar, who directs 2,500 fighters engaged in Tal Afar said that the Tal Afar has approximately 900 ISIS fighters left, of which 650 are local and 250 are foreign fighters. “The district of Tal Afar once held 350,000 Turkmen residents, including Shia and Sunni families, but only 30,000 civilians still live there, chiefly in the town of Maria,” Najjar said.

“Whether the next fight against ISIS is in Tal Afar, Al-Hawija, or Al-Qaim, the coalition will continue to support our Iraqi partners to defeat our common enemy,” said Col. Ryan Dillon, spokesman for the Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR), speaking to defense reporters Thursday.

An Obamacare program awarded hospitals thousands of dollars in bonuses even if they had low-quality scores, according to a reportfrom the Government Accountability Office.

The Hospital Value-Based Purchasing program, which was created by Obamacare, was designed to incentivize participating hospitals to increase efficiency and quality.

Even though the program’s purpose is to reward hospitals that offer high-quality care at a lower cost, the auditors found that hospitals with low quality scores but high efficiency scores still received bonuses.

In fiscal year 2017, there were 345 hospitals that received a bonus with quality scores below the median. Roughly 20 percent of hospitals that received a bonus had a quality score below the median from 2015 through 2017.

The of numbers of individuals in different states on food stamps have dropped precipitously after certain counties in different states decided to re-establish work requirements for food stamp government benefits that ballooned under the Obama administration, Fox News reported Tuesday.

A 2009 congressional economic stimulus package did away with previous work requirements in the states for able-bodied adults and the rolls of those on food stamps spiked to 48 million people across the country by 2013. Preliminary figures for Fiscal Year 2017 show that the number of recipients on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is in a downward trend.

Other ways are being explored to cut the number of SNAP recipients.

After re-instituting the work requirement in 21 more counties in Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported a 62 percent drop in SNAP participants.

San Antonio Police Chief William McManus appeared on “Fox and Friends” Wednesday to discuss anti-police rhetoric after NYPD officer Miosotis Familia was gunned down while sitting in her patrol car.

NBC New York said the shooter was a 34-year-old ex-convict from the Bronx named Alexander Bonds.

The gunman who ambushed and shot an NYPD officer sitting inside her mobile command vehicle Wednesday morning, killing her, was a 34-year-old ex-convict out on parole for robbery, officials say. A motive in the shooting is still not clear, but Alexander Bonds of the Bronx, who also went by the name John Bonds, once ranted online about his treatment in prison and about police getting away with killing people. He had also expressed an anti-government sentiment in online posts, according to a law enforcement official.

San Antonio’s Chief McManus recently dealt with a similar situation to the shooting of Familia when two of his officers were shot at an event he described as “the most unprovoked attack I have ever seen.”

McManus said, “I’m angry at the police haters, I’m sick of the police haters. We protect them. We defend them. And they give us a big F U. And I’m sick of it.”

France has announced its intentions to make 11 vaccines mandatory for children in the face of record low confidence in its population that vaccines can be trusted.

The French website The Local reports that in a parliamentary address on Tuesday, France’s Prime Minister Edouard Philippe declared the government’s plan to implement the mandatory requirements, adding eight vaccines to the mandatory list that already included the vaccines for polio, tetanus and diphtheria.

The move is supported in France’s medical community as a pathway to ensure that immunity remains at acceptable levels in the face of an alarming resurgence in diseases that were all but eliminated a decade ago. According to Santé publique France, a governmental public health monitoring agency in France, measles has been of of these resurgent diseases, with more than 24,000 cases since 2008 which led to 34 cases in neurological complications and 10 deaths.

In a letter from 200 doctors supporting this measure, the importance of protecting the vulnerable was emphasized. The group’s endorsement was in part motivated “because vaccination is not only a personal choice with benefits only for the person vaccinated but aims to protect the population, especially children, the elderly or frail.”

65% of Trump supporters would back a military strike on North Korea, according to a new poll.

The Twitter poll, which received almost 30,000 votes, asked “If Trump launched a military strike on North Korea, would you support it?”

Just 35% of respondents said they would oppose military action.

The numbers that would back a military strike seem significantly higher than those who supported aggression against Syria following April’s cruise missile strike, an event that split Trump’s base.

During a speech in front of the United Nations, Ambassador Nikki Haley warned that sanctions wouldn’t be enough to stop Kim Jong-Un’s dictatorship and that the U.S. was prepared to use “our considerable military forces”.

“Time is short. Action is required. The world is on notice,” she said.

According to the Pentagon, North Korea’s July 4 missile launch was a new type “we have not seen before”.

Most authorities on the issue agree that Pyongyang launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching Alaska, but not the U.S. mainland.

After the launch, North Korea claimed it was, “a full-fledged nuclear power that has been possessed of the most powerful inter-continental ballistic rocket capable of hitting any part of the world”.

North Korea test launched Tuesday an intercontinental ballistic missile that may be capable of reaching Alaska.

The projectile, known as the Hwasong-14, was said to have reached an altitude of 2,802 kilometers (1,741 miles) before flying 933 kilometers (579 miles).

The launch is being described by experts as a “game-changer” that further limits the already scant and risky options available to the Trump administration for dealing with Pyongyang.

According to the Korean Central News Agency, North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un described the ICBM as “a gift” to “American bastards.” The news agency also claimed the missile is capable of carrying a “large, heavy nuclear warhead.”

The United Nations Security Council is expected to issue a stern condemnation of the launch after an emergency meeting scheduled Wednesday.

South Korea and the United States responded to the ICBM test by conducting a joint ballistic-missile drill of its own.

The following images were released by North Korean media outlet Rodong Sinmun:

“South Park” creator Trey Parker says his subversive show won’t feature too many Trump-themed gags in its upcoming season, a deliberate effort to avoid becoming a cable news show disguised as an animated comedy.

Parker told the Los Angeles Times that he never intended “South Park,” now entering its 20th year, to be a show that obsesses over every political controversy of the moment, which today usually involves the president’s latest tweet.

“We did start to become that, though, especially the last season,” he said. “We fell into the same trap that “Saturday Night Live” fell into, where it was like, ‘Dude, we’re just becoming CNN now.’ We’re becoming, ‘Tune in to see what we’re going to say about Trump.’ Matt [co-creator Matt Stone] and I hated it but we got stuck in it somehow.”

“South Park” has earned legions of fans — and the distinction of being the second-longest running animated series in TV history — by skewering the sacred cows of both the progressive left and the family-values right. Over years of taking on, among other sensitive topics, Christianity, Islam, gay rights, illegal immigration, and transgenderism, the show has become perhaps the foremost political satire in popular culture. (RELATED: ‘South Park’ Mocks Black Lives Matter, Colin Kaepernick In Season Opener)

But Parker says “South Park” has always been, at heart, a show about bored, small-town kids getting into mischief. He intends to return to that dynamic this year.

“This season I want to get back to Cartman dressing up like a robot and [screwing] with Butters, because to me that’s the bread and butter of “South Park”: kids being kids and being ridiculous and outrageous but not ‘did you see what Trump did last night?’” Parker told the L.A. Times.

“Because I don’t give a … anymore,” he added.

Trump’s freewheeling, combative political style and daily Twitter outbursts make him an appealing target for “South Park,” but the show’s iconoclastic creators are content to leave jokes about the president to someone else.

“We probably could put up billboards — “Look what we’re going to do to Trump next week!” — and get crazy ratings,” Parker said.

“But I just don’t care.”

Migrants from Central American countries are increasingly choosing to resettle in Mexico as the Trump administration’s tough immigration enforcement policies make the U.S. a less accessible destination.

For years, Mexico has largely been a waypoint for people from the so-called Northern Triangle countries — Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador — who were trying to cross into the U.S. and petition for asylum. As the U.S. has cracked down on illegal immigration at the border and tightened its rules on accepting asylum claims, those migrants are now staying put in Mexico.

As a result, Mexico’s refugee applications have risen dramatically over the last three years, reports the Associated Press. It received 3,424 applications for refugee status in 2015, and the number more than doubled to 8,794 the next year. Mexico is on track to receive even more refugee applications in 2017 — there were 5,464 applications from just January to May.

Migration experts say word of tougher immigration and asylum policies in the U.S. has made its way back to Central America, causing migrants to choose Mexico or other neighboring countries instead. Maureen Meyer, a senior associate for Mexico at the Washington Office on Latin America, says potential immigrants now realize that Mexico is a safer bet for asylum claims.

“If you look at Mexico’s definition of who can qualify for asylum, it’s much broader than the United States,” Meyer told the AP. “If you are fleeing widespread violence in your country, you may be able to qualify for asylum in Mexico, whereas in the U.S. you have to prove that you belong to very specific groups of people.”

Mexico granted refugee status to about one of every three applicants from the Northern Triangle in 2016, reports the AP. The U.S., on the other hand, denies about 80 percent of asylum claims by people from those countries, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.

Under the Obama administration, migration from the Northern Triangle to the U.S. reached unprecedented levels. In 2013, as many as 2.7 million people born in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras were living in the United States, according to a report from the Council on Foreign Relations. That was up from an estimated 1.5 million people in 2000.

Between October 2013 and July 2015, more 100,000 unaccompanied minors from the Northern Triangle arrived in the U.S. and were given expedited resettlement under an emergency Obama order to deal with the surge.

The Trump administration has taken a much less permissive stance, pressuring Mexico to accept more Central American immigrants while publicly discouraging people from making the trek northward.

“We have asked them [Northern Triangle countries] to ask their citizens to not waste the money and head north, do not get on that terribly dangerous network,” Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly told the Senate in June. “Stay where they are, because if they come here, this is no longer an illegal-alien-friendly environment.”

A California judge has dismissed a case that alleged Facebook tracks users even once they have logged out of their Facebook accounts.

The Guardian reports that a case alleging that social media giant Facebook was tracking its user’s browsing habits despite being logged out of their Facebook accounts has been dismissed by the judge presiding over the case. The plaintiffs in the case claimed that through the use of “like” buttons, which appear on many websites across the internet, Facebook was tracking their user’s browsing habits and building detailed reports, an act which the plaintiffs argued violated federal and state privacy and wiretapping laws.

The case was dismissed by US District Judge Edward Davila of San Jose, California who stated that the plaintiffs in the case had not proven that they had a reasonable expectation of privacy or had suffered any realistic economic harm or loss due to Facebook’s actions. Davila said that the plaintiffs failed to prove that Facebook had in fact spied on them and had failed to take necessary precautions to protect their web browsing habits, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out tool.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Evidence emerging from the Vatican in recent days strongly suggests Pope Francis is transforming the Catholic Church into a socialist political organization that embraces the LGBT agenda, in complete rejection of the traditional pro-family religious orientation of his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI.

Last week, Pope Francis fired the Vatican’s top theologian, Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Mueller, the head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, who had a reputation as a staunch defender of the traditional family.

Pope Francis replaced Cardinal Mueller with the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith’s second-in-command, the more liberal Archbishop Luis Francisco Ladaria Ferrer.

Then, on Thursday, July 5, the Daily Mail in London reported Vatican police had broken up a gay orgy occurring in the Vatican-owned apartment belonging to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.

Ironically, this was also the Vatican department Pope Francis had assigned to investigate the Catholic Church’s pedophile sex scandal involving priests in the United States as well as various other countries around the world.

The apartment was apparently the residence of the male secretary to Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio, one of Pope Francis’ key advisors, and the president of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, another key part of the Roman Curia responsible for administering the activities of the Catholic Church worldwide.

Neither development surprised reporter George Neumayr, whose recent book, The Political Pope: How Pope Francis is Delighting the Liberal Left and Abandoning Conservatives, predicted Pope Francis will accelerate the transformation of the Catholic Church into a leftist political organization after former Pope Benedict XVI dies.

“Pope Francis inherited Cardinal Muller from his predecessor and was itching to sack him,” Neumayr explained to Infowars.com in an email.

“Pope Francis was annoyed by Muller’s opposition to the relativism of this pontificate, particularly Muller’s resistance to the pope’s plan to relax the Church’s teaching on adultery,” Neumayr continued.

“Muller also opposed the pope’s policy of distributing Communion to divorced-and-remarried Catholics,” Neumayr added.

Neumayr interpreted the move as Pope Francis distancing himself from the more conservative, traditional papacy of Pope Benedict XVI.

“By dropping Muller, Pope Francis is trying to free himself for once and all from the conservative restraints of Pope Benedict XVI, whose opposition to the ‘dictatorship of relativism’ Pope Francis always disliked,” Neumayr explained.

“Appropriately, Pope Francis has replaced Muller with a fellow Jesuit, the Spanish archbishop Luis Ladaria Ferrer, who appears willing to serve as a rubber stamp for the pope’s liberalism,” Neumayr concluded.

Neumayr also commented on the developing Vatican gay sex orgy scandal.

“This is proof the gay mafia has reached the highest echelons of the Catholic Church,” Neumayr told Infowars.com in an exclusive telephone interview.

“Instead of disbanding the gay mafia, Pope Francis evidently has allowed the gay mafia to burrow deeper into the Vatican.”

Neumayr referenced the decision Pope Francis made in July 2013 to appoint Monsignor Battista Ricca, a veteran Vatican diplomat, to serve as his representative, or “prelate” at the Vatican Bank despite allegations of various gay sexual scandals that plagued Ricca since 1999, when he was sent by the Vatican to Montevideo, Uruguay.

“The ecclesiastical head of the Vatican Bank is still Monsignor Ricca,” Neumayr commented, “and he was entangled in a similar gay sexual scandal before his elevation to his current position.”

Neumayr noted that Pope Francis was aware of the sexual scandal allegations made against Ricca, but Pope Francis decided to disregard the charges when he decided to go ahead and make Ricca head of Vatican Bank anyway.

“No one should be surprised by these episodes — either the firing of Cardinal Mueller or the emerging gay orgy sex scandal,” Neumayr suggested.

“Both are consistent with the direction in which Pope Francis is taking the Catholic Church,” he concluded.

An “astonishing” rise in harmful Christian exorcisms is being partly driven by migrant communities, a think tank has warned.

A report by Theos, a think tank focusing on religion, found that experts were concerned that the “booming industry” in exorcisms was putting Christians’ mental health at risk.

The report, which examines the relationship between Christianity and mental health, said: “Exorcisms are now a booming industry in the UK, with a number of interviewees noting the astonishing increase in demand – often, as one noted, in defiance of any actual rules or procedures put in place by any church.”

It said that this industry was in part “driven by immigrant communities and Pentecostal churches which are very open about their exorcism services”.

According to New York Magazine and Huffington Post contributing writer Yashar Ali, Secret Service agents interviewed Kathy Griffin for over an hour on Monday to discuss the photo where she posed with Donald Trump’s bloody head in her hand.

Like many of his fellow Polish pro-government lawmakers, Dominik Tarczynski is sending a busload of constituents to Warsaw on Thursday to cheer for President Donald Trump. The buses are being provided by a foundation close to the governing party.

“It’s going to be huge—absolutely huge,” Mr. Tarczynski said of the coming welcome for Mr. Trump. “They just love him, the people in Poland—they just really love him.”

Poland is working to put on a hero’s welcome for Mr. Trump as he prepares to give a major speech to thousand of Poles in a Warsaw square. Behind that effort is a recognition across the continent that Mr. Trump has the potential to change the balance of power in Europe.

Parents in France will be legally obliged to vaccinate their children from 2018, the government has announced.

French Prime Minister Édouard Philippe said it was “unacceptable” that children are “still dying of measles” in the country where some of the earliest vaccines were pioneered.

Three childhood vaccines, for diphtheria, tetanus and polio, are currently mandatory in France. Others, including those against hepatitis and whooping cough, are simply recommended.

Announcing the policy, Mr Philippe evoked the name of Louis Pasteur, the French biologist who made breakthroughs in disease research and developed the first vaccines for rabies and anthrax in the 19th century.

The acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under the Trump Administration is the same bureaucrat responsible for overseeing the release of violent criminal illegal aliens into U.S. communities under the Obama Administration. The acting director, Thomas Homan, previously headed Obama’s Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), a position where Homan helped direct the release of criminal illegal aliens. Homan received an award from President Obama for his work on immigration matters.

The agents and officers in the National ICE Council are sounding the alarm that such a bureaucrat would somehow be chosen by the Trump Administration to lead a flagship effort such as immigration law enforcement. ICE Council President Chris Crane, also an ICE Officer, spoke with Breitbart Texas and painted a dismal picture of the politics playing out in how our nation’s immigration laws are enforced.

“It is a disgrace that the man who oversaw Obama’s effort to release criminal illegal aliens into our country is now the acting director of ICE,” said Officer Crane. “Someone under Trump has been allowed too much authority in choosing the worst possible Obama-holdover to lead the vital effort of enforcing our nation’s immigration laws.”

NPR faced accusations of political bias Tuesday for marking the Fourth of July by tweeting out the entire Declaration of Independence.

NPR has celebrated Independence Day for 29 years by having hosts, reporters and commentators read the Declaration of Independence on-air.

But a number of Twitter users slammed NPR for tweeting it this year, interpreting the outlet’s sharing of the founding U.S. document as a call “for revolution” and a way to “condone the violence.”

While some users ripped NPR, others mocked those who disapproved:

Cable network CNN identified the man allegedly responsible for creating a meme depicting US President Donald Trump body-slamming the network, an image the president shared on Twitter last week.

After the anonymous Reddit user, “HanAssholeSolo,” issued an apology, CNN graciously said it would not publicly expose the person’s identity if he agreed not to do it again – a move which many saw as blackmail.

In light of CNN’s threat to dox the anonymous Redditor, #CNNBlackmail became a top trend and the Internet naturally responded in kind with more memes depicting CNN being pulverized by President Trump.

Here are a few…

Despite claims President Donald Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton marked a resurgence in the voting power of Christians in America, a globalist publication is claiming the last election was “the death rattle of White Christian America.”

“Does Trump’s victory, then, represent the resurrection of White Christian America? The consequences of the 2016 elections are indeed sweeping,” wrote Robert Jones in an excerpt from his book “The End of White Christian America” reposted in The Atlantic.



“Republicans entered 2017 with control of both houses of Congress and the White House, and because the Republican-controlled Senate refused to consider an Obama appointee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in early 2016, Trump was able to nominate a conservative Supreme Court justice right out of the gate.”

“The evidence, however, suggests that Trump’s unlikely victory is better understood as the death rattle of White Christian America — the cultural and political edifice built primarily by white Protestant Christians — rather than as its resuscitation.”

While white evangelical Christians represented 21% of the general population at the time of the 2008 election, they comprised 26% of actual voters. In 2016, despite a decline in their proportion of the population to 17%, white evangelicals continued to represent 26% of voters – clear evidence President Trump’s warnings about the dire attacks on religious liberty resonated with evangelical voters.

“Despite the outcome of the 2016 elections, the key long-term trends indicate White Christian America’s decline is continuing unabated,” Jones suggested. “Over the last eight years, the percentage of Americans who identify as white and Christian fell 11 percentage points, and support for same-sex marriage jumped 18 percentage points.”

The campaign between Clinton and Trump presented voters two starkly contrasting views of America’s future, he added.

“Donald Trump’s campaign painted a bleak portrait of America’s present, set against a bright, if monochromatic, vision of 1950s America restored. Hillary Clinton’ campaign, by contrast, sought to replace the first African American president with the first female president and embraced the multicultural future of 2050, the year the Census Bureau originally projected the United States would become a majority nonwhite nation,” Jones claimed.

Jones, the chief executive of the Public Religion Research Institute, first made his opinions about the decline of white Christian America known in an op-ed written in the immediate aftermath of Trump’s victory.

“The waning numbers of white Christians in the country today may not have time on their side, but as the sun is slowly setting on the cultural world of white Christian America, they’ve managed, at least in this election, to rage against the dying of the light,” he wrote in The New York Times.

CNN Senior Political Analyst Ronald Brownstein recently argued both political parties represent “virtually mirror image Americas with very little overlap,” with the Democratic Party representing a coalition of voters that is “racially diverse, younger, more secular, overwhelmingly urbanized, and more rooted in the globalized, post-industrial and low-carbon economy.”

“That jagged contrast between what I have called the Democrats’ ‘Coalition of Transformation,’ which largely welcomes those changes, and the Republican ‘Coalition of Restoration,’ which largely feels unsettled or eclipsed by them, has become arguably the central fault line in American life.”

CNN host Alisyn Camerota could not contain her excitement at the fact that her network had tracked down the Reddit user who created the Trump wrestling meme, and that he has issued an apology, despite the fact that CNN is being accused of using sinister blackmail tactics, threatening to publicly identify the person.

“I thought it was remarkable that CNN found the Reddit user who created the GIF,” a clearly enthusiastic Camerota told viewers.

The anchor read out a statement of apology from the meme creator (pictured below).





“…the investigative team went back and found the guy who first created this,” she noted, adding “How often do you hear someone who creates a video, goes viral, and apologizes.”

“The reason that I think this is so notable … This is a very, full-throated, genuine honest apology,” Camerota said. “He has also asked that we not reveal his name or whereabouts, and we at CNN are honoring that because he’s apologized, and he thinks that he would then be in danger and at risk if other people knew his name. We get it. We understand that.”

Reporter Chris Cillizza said that it was a very “nice thing” that CNN “tracked him down,” while CNN host Chris Cuomo stated that the individual apologized after he was “exposed and identified.”

However, Cuomo’s assertions run in contradiction to the claims of CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski, who is accused of carrying out the blackmailing.

Kaczynski claims that the user posted an apology before he was contacted.

https://twitter.com/KFILE/status/882418323673239553

Kaczynski also claims that the ‘threat’ CNN made to dox the individual is being ‘misinterpreted’.

https://twitter.com/KFILE/status/882438606270410752

https://twitter.com/KFILE/status/882417992717537280

CNN’s Chris Cuomo also took to Twitter to slam the individual for being a ‘ faceless hater’:

is being faceless getting old? own your words with an identity. truth, faceless hater, is not about telling you what you want to hear https://t.co/VKyFkQ7eJo — Christopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) July 5, 2017

Cuomo was quickly reminded that most of CNN’s hit pieces on the President have relied on ‘anonymous sources’:

CNN reporters now going after anonymity CNN has relied on anon sources for dozens of nonsense Trump/Russia stories, incl retracted stories https://t.co/oHvWbLKhmB — Omri Ceren (@omriceren) July 5, 2017

When Americans responded to Cuomo by saying CNN’s ratings were collapsing, the reporter just dug in deeper:

The culprit behind a shocking “unprovoked attack” on a female police officer had spouted anti-cop rhetoric in the past and urged people to vote for Hillary Clinton.

Authorities are trying to piece together a motive after NYPD officer and mother of three Miosotis Familia was brutally gunned down in cold blood by Alexander Bonds early Monday morning while she sat in a temporary headquarters vehicle at East 183rd Street and Morris Avenue in Fordham Heights.

Bonds was subsequently killed by two other officers called to the scene while Familia died in hospital.

“This is absolutely an unprovoked attack,” said NYPD Commissioner James P. O’Neill. Police say surveillance footage shows Bonds pulling up his hoodie before “purposefully” walking up to the vehicle and shooting through the passenger side.

Speculation as to why 34-year-old Bonds, who had previously served seven years in prison for a Syracuse robbery, gunned down Familia has begun to center on his political beliefs.

Bonds’ Facebook page reveals that days before the presidential election, he posted a video of a woman alleging that voting machines were switching Hillary Clinton votes to Donald Trump.

“Watch out also go vote our voices matter believe that if I could I kno u would,” he wrote.

On the same day he urged people to “get mad” about the election and vote. When asked who he was voting for, Bonds responded that he couldn’t vote (due to his felony conviction), but said people should vote for Hillary Clinton.

According to the New York Daily News, Bonds, “Spoke critically of law enforcement on an unspecified social media site.”

The video below features Bonds engaged in a foul-mouthed rant against the police.

Man who murdered NYPD officer Miosotis Familia posted anti-police video on Facebook. pic.twitter.com/bqTP18XFOu — Josh Caplan (@joshdcaplan) July 5, 2017

Bonds also posted Malcolm X memes as well as videos of confrontations between black people and police officers.

Previous ambush-style murders of police officers have been motivated by extremist anti-cop ‘Black Lives Matter’-style rhetoric, as well as mass shootings of police officers like the Dallas massacre, which was celebrated by BLM sympathizers.

There has been no word yet from prominent ‘Black Lives Matter’ personalities about the killing of Miosotis Familia.

CNN’s terrifying decision to threaten to personally destroy HanAssholeSolo, the person who created the epic WWE video President Trump tweeted out last week, CNN’s chilling move to go the full-Brownshirt against some nobody goofing on the Internet, does not surprise me at all.

What is a little shocking is how open the leftwing network was about its mafia tactics. A threat, an actual threat, a warning to others, right there in print! On CNN! [emphasis added]

CNN, a multi-billion dollar, mega-media corporation will be watching the behavior of a private citizen (all of us, really) and should this person (all of us, really) ever be discovered behaving in a way that this multi-billion dollar, mega-media corporation disapproves, this multi-billion dollar, mega-corporation will ruin this person’s life (all of our lives, really) — will reveal YOUR name, will see to it that you lose your job, are harassed out of your home, and whatever other horrors CNN’s fascist SJW Army can come up with.

Newly released data from the NHS shows there were more than 5,000 new cases of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) recorded over the last year, with 120 cases involving women and girls that were born in the UK.

The practice is banned in the UK, however, many families take young girls out of the country in order to undergo the barbaric procedure. Since 1985 when it became illegal in the UK, not a single parent has been prosecuted.

Data suggests those most at risk are girls from Egypt, Gambia, Kenya and Nigeria. Around a third of all cases involves girls from Somalia.

CNN is reeling from a huge backlash after the news organization was accused of blackmailing the creator of the infamous Trump-CNN wrestling meme by threatening to reveal his identity.

The mainstream media thought it had scored a victory when it was discovered that the original creator of the meme had previously posted racist content.

However, the individual, know by his handle ‘HanAssholeSolo’, has if anything been turned into a martyr.

The controversy erupted when CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski bragged that CNN had refrained from publishing HanAssholeSolo’s real name because he had “issued an extensive statement of apology,” showed remorse and promised not to make fun of CNN again.

“CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change,” stated the article.

This led to a firestorm of fury, with even many on the left slamming CNN for its unethical, and possibly illegal, practice.

Kaczynski then attempted to claim that HanAssholeSolo had apologized before CNN contacted him, contradicting his previous tweet which stated that HanAssholeSolo’s apology “came after CNN identified and reached out to him.”

The reaction on Twitter was vitriolic as #CNNBlackmail began trending.

Wikileaks’ Julian Assange posted a number of tweets in which he documented how CNN had broken the law, as well as tweeting, “A multi-billion dollar TV network blackmailing a private citizen into not making funny videos about it is not journalism, CNN.”

CNN essentially blackmailed a private citizen because he made fun of CNN.

Let that sink in.

Should a news organization that blackmails private citizens be allowed to have White House press access?

Fresh off the back of James O’Keefe’s CNN exposé , the news network is on the ropes. It’s difficult to see how they’re going to recover from this one without huge damage to their credibility.

It also remains to be seen whether the originator of the meme, who some claim could be as young as 15-years-old (although Kaczynski denies this), will seek to launch a lawsuit against CNN.

Leftist media figures questioned whether or not President Trump was threatening them after he tweeted on Monday that “at some point” the news “will be forced to discuss our great job numbers” and “strong economy.”

From Breitbart:

Trump tweeted: “At some point the Fake News will be forced to discuss our great jobs numbers, strong economy, success with ISIS, the border & so much else!”

NBC’s Katy Tur oh-so-seriously and ominously asked on-air what Trump meant by “forced.” Talking Points Memo asked, “Trump declares the press will be “forced” to cover his achievements. What First Amendment?”

Later in the day, though he did not specifically mention or refer to the tweet, NBC’s Chuck Todd spoke generally about Trump’s “dehumanizing” tweets.

“If these actions and this language was being used by a leader in a different country, our State Department… not just we in general… would be saying ‘Hmm, that country is inching towards authoritarianism,'” Todd said. “Because that’s usually the first sign: when you try to delegitimize a free press.”

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un promised more small and big “gift packages” for “the US imperialists” while he was pleased to observe the first successful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test, according to the North’s official state media.

Lauding the DPRK’s scientists and pleased with the fact that Tuesday’s successful launch coincided with Independence Day in the US, Kim Jong-un called to “frequently send big and small ‘gift packages’ to the Yankees as ever so that they will not feel weary,” the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said, as cited by KCNA Watch on Wednesday.

The report added that Kim was “feasting his eyes” on the latest addition to the North’s arsenal before the test, calling it the final phase of “the protracted showdown with the US imperialists,” which can “demonstrate its mettle to the US which is testing its will in defiance of its warning.”

On Tuesday morning, Pyongyang claimed it had successfully launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile, Hwasong-14, which is capable of carrying a “large, heavy nuclear warhead.” The missile, which can reportedly strike the US mainland, was called “another brilliant victory of the Korean people in their struggle against the US-led imperialists.”

“The test-launch confirmed the features of the rocket’s blast-off from its launching pad and technological features of its guidance and stability system in its active-flight stages and structural system,” KCNA reported.

After the launch, Pyongyang said its Hwasong-14 ICBM flew some 933km in 39 minutes, reaching an altitude of 2,802km, according to state television.

However, there are different estimates of the range of the latest missile. The US military initially said the rocket was a land-based intermediate-range ballistic missile, which fell into the Sea of Japan (known in Korea as the East Sea) after covering more than 930km in 37 minutes.

Later in the day Washington changed its assessment, saying that Pyongyang’s rocket had a two-stage design which would allow the projectile to fly the range required to be classed as an ICBM.

Meanwhile the South Korean military confirmed that its northern neighbor tested a new ICBM, according to Yonhap.

On Tuesday, the Russian Defense Ministry stated that North Korea launched an intermediate range missile (IRBM), which flew some 535 kilometers, reaching an altitude of 510km, and fell into the Sea of Japan, according to its data.

The type of the missile determines the distance it can cover and thus whether it would be able to reach and strike the United States, which is treated as one of the top threats to North Korean security and vice versa. ICBMs can cover a distance of more than of 5,500km and can potentially hit the US, while IRBMs have a much shorter range and pose no threat.

The test launch triggered the world’s reaction, from world leaders’ statements to joint drills. On Tuesday, Moscow and Beijing called on North Korea to freeze its nuclear and missile programs, and at the same time urged the US and South Korea to abstain from holding war games in the region.

Despite the warnings, the US and South Korean militaries launched surface-to-surface tactical missiles into neutral waters, with the American side threatening to deploy and engage missile systems in case of further provocation from the North.

However, Pyongyang is apparently not planning to stop its nuclear and missile tests as long as Washington follows a “hostile policy” towards Pyongyang and poses a “nuclear threat.”

“The DPRK would neither put its nukes and ballistic rockets on the table of negotiations in any case nor flinch even an inch from the road of bolstering the nuclear force chosen by itself unless the US hostile policy and nuclear threat to the DPRK are definitely terminated,” state media KCNA said.

Over the past 20 years, European cities have slowly become more ethnically diverse, as EU governments open their borders to foreign populations.

And as this process has taken place, the authorities have been quick to cover up any crimes that have been committed by these populations. For instance, Swedish police are no longer allowed to describe the ethnic background of the criminals they catch, and most notably, the German government and press were desperate to cover up hundreds sexual assaults that occurred in Cologne in 2015.

However, there are certain statistics that can’t be covered up. A government can try to conceal the connection between crimes and specific ethnic groups, but they can’t cover up the overall crime statistics of an entire city. Plus, politically correct governments can’t really hide the ethnic diversity of their cities. That’s something that their progressive sensibilities command them to promote.

Fortunately, sometimes those two factors come together to give us all a good look at the relationship between immigration and crime in Europe, despite the best efforts of European governments to conceal that connection. For example, the German government recently revealed that more than half of the population of Frankfurt has a foreign background, arguably making it the most diverse major city in Germany.

For the first time, more than half of Frankfurt residents now have a migrant background, according to official data from the city’s Office of Statistics and Elections. Presenting the figures, which show that 51.2 per cent of people living in Frankfurt have a migrant background, the city’s secretary of integration Sylvia Weber said: “We have minorities with relatively large numbers in Frankfurt but no group with a clear majority.” Representing 13 per cent of the population, Turks are the city’s largest non-German minority, and 61 per cent of residents who were born abroad are citizens of other European Union (EU) countries.

And on top of that, the data reveals that these people aren’t thriving in Germany. 49% of people with foreign backgrounds in Frankfurt live below the poverty line, compared to 23% of native Germans, and they are significantly more likely to be unemployed. But that’s not the real kicker. Frankfurt was a diverse city long before the migrant crisis reached its peak, and even then it had a startling crime rate.

The 2013 national crime figures, which were leaked to Welt newspaper earlier this week, show just under six million crimes were recorded in Germany last year. When broken down to the number of crimes per 100,000 inhabitants, Frankfurt am Main rates as the most dangerous city in Germany with 16,292 crimes per 100,000 people. Its high ranking was put down to its red light district and the large airport.

Of course if you brought this fact up to most leftists, they would call you a racist. But it has nothing to do with race. The real problem is that Germany hasn’t properly vetted their immigrants, nor have they successfully assimilated them. Germany is inviting people into their country who have no respect for German law, and they aren’t pressuring them to join German culture. And the result is rather predictable. Germany has a large foreign population that is young, jobless, alienated from mainstream culture, and more likely to commit crimes.

What we’re seeing in Frankfurt is the future of Europe, if EU nations continue to celebrate multiculturalism and leave their borders wide open. It will be a divided continent, filled with ethnic enclaves, no-go zones, civil unrest, and crime. If they don’t see the folly of multiculturalism, within a generation every city in Europe will be like Frankfurt, or perhaps even worse.

French president Emmanuel Macron has declared he will govern France like Jupiter, the Roman king of the gods, shortly after officials told the media his thought process was “too complex” for journalists to understand.

Summoning over 900 politicians from both houses of the French parliament to a rare Congress at the palace of Louis XIV – the ‘Sun King’ – in Versailles, he threatened to overrule lawmakers with a referendum if they try to frustrate the “reforms” he wishes to impose on the legislature. Such assemblies are usually reserved for times of national crisis.

Reuters reports him as saying he desires to reign as a “Jupiterian” president – “a remote, dignified figure, like the Roman god of gods, who weighs his rare pronouncements carefully”.

Amid North Korea’s repeated missile launches, evacuation drills conducted with the participation of local residents and based on the scenario that a missile strike is imminent are being held in many places across the nation.

Such drills have already been conducted in nine prefectures, and there are more scheduled to be carried out in at least 11 prefectures.

This month, the nation’s first drill in which people will evacuate to an underground mall is scheduled to occur in Takaoka, Toyama Prefecture.

People who might face such an emergency are required to evacuate in a different way than in the event of an earthquake.

Bill Gates has blasted Germany’s open-door migrant policy warning European leaders they must make it more difficult for North Africans to reach the continent.

The Microsoft founder and world’s richest person said Europe will not be able to handle the huge numbers of people desperately trying to leave Africa.

This comes as Austrian tanks have moved to seal off a vital border with Italy as over 84,000 migrants from North African have reached Italian shores this year – a 19 per cent increase from last year according to the UN.

Spain is also struggling to cope with the crisis with 6,000 people arriving by boat this year and dozens drowning during the treacherous journey.

Speaking with German news outlet Welt am Sonntag newspaper, US billionaire Gates, 61, said developed nations should instead be spending more on foreign aid to treat the causes of migration.

He said: “On the one hand you want to demonstrate generosity and take in refugees.

“But the more generous you are, the more word gets around about this — which in turn motivates more people to leave Africa.

“Germany cannot possibly take in the huge number of people who are wanting to make their way to Europe.”

While the world watches in jest as Japanese residents prepare for the possibility of a confrontation with North Korea by panic buying nuclear shelters and air purifiers, we may soon realize that their efforts to desperately acquire protective gear and equipment for nuclear disaster were quite prescient.

Yesterday, North Korea successfully tested what is reportedly an ICBM (Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile) capable of striking Alaska from the Korean peninsula. Coupled with their purported advancements in nuclear technology, North Korea may now have the ability to launch devastating attacks on their southern neighbor, Japan and even the United States. And if they have not yet achieved the ability to fit a nuclear warhead on an ICBM and deliver it effectively to its target, they are inching closer by the day.

So close, in fact, that Chinese Ambassador Liu Jieyi’s recent remarks on the matter suggest that we are nearing a dangerous breaking point:

“Currently tensions are high and we certainly would like to see a de-escalation,” Liu told a news conference at UN headquarters as China takes over the Security Council presidency in July. “If tension only goes up … then sooner or later it will get out of control and the consequences would be disastrous,” he said.

Earlier this year President Trump deployed three carrier strike groups to the region, signaling the real possibility that the United States will no longer follow what Secretary of State Rex Tillerson calls a policy of “strategic patience” employed by Trump’s predecessors.

Though the threat seems to be muted by global media, China and Russia appear to be taking it very seriously, with both having reportedly deployed tens of thousands of troops and equipment to their respective borders with the North.

All of the signs suggest that military action is about to occur. And while most Americans may think that North Korea would be another Iraq, wherein the battle could be won in a matter days, the fact is that North Korea has a massive military and now, as confirmed yesterday, an ICBM capable of striking long-range targets.

Now may be a good time to imitate the Japanese by preparing for the worst, because the moment the world realizes that war is imminent there will be a run on banks and grocery stores that will likely leave shelves and ATM machines completely empty. Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the price of government recommended anti-radiation pills skyrocketed from $15 to over $200 per unit. We expect to see a similar effect in coming weeks and months for preparedness equipment like gas masks and NBC body suits as tensions on the Peninsula heat up.

War is coming. President Trump has made this very clear and North Korea does not appear to be heeding his warning. All bets will be off once the missiles start flying.

Because all three of the world’s major super powers will be involved in one way or another it is not only possible, but quite likely that things could spiral out of control very quickly.

A female New York City police officer has died after being shot in the Bronx early Wednesday in what police described as an “unprovoked attack.”

Police rushed to the scene in Fordham in the area of 183rd Street and Morris Avenue around 12:30 a.m. The officer, identified as 48-year-old Miosotis Familia, was sitting in a marked NYPD command vehicle with her partner when she was shot, Commissioner James P. O’Neill said at a Wednesday morning press conference.

O’Neill said the suspect fired through the window of the car, striking the officer in the head. Her partner immediately radioed in for assistance.

“We are conducting an extensive search for video at this time,” O’Neill said at the press conference. “Based off what we know right now, it’s clear this was an unprovoked attack on a police officer who are assigned to keep the people of this great city safe.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Donald Trump will hold their first full-fledged meeting at the G20 summit on July 7, the Kremlin spokesman said. Dmitry Peskov specified it will not merely be a brief contact on the sidelines.

The meeting is “planned as a full-fledged ‘sit down’ meeting,” Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday.

The G20 summit will take place July 7-8 in Hamburg, Germany. During the summit, Trump is to meet Putin face-to-face for the first time. Previously the leaders have spoken only by phone.

The White House has also confirmed that a “normal bilateral meeting” between the leaders is to take place on Friday afternoon, according to Reuters.

Earlier, Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov said the long-awaited meeting is scheduled for July 7, but did not specify its format.

Conflicts in Syria and Ukraine will be among other issues on the agenda during the meeting between the two leaders, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov stated.

“Of course, both Syria and Ukraine will be in the spotlight, but the agenda is not limited to them,” Ryabkov told reporters in Moscow, adding that Putin and Trump are also to discuss strategic stability, as well as a number of bilateral issues.

“At least we believe that the American side will be ready for such dialogue, and we will see how the conversation really goes. Eventually, everything depends on the leaders,” Ryabkov said.

Relations between Moscow and Washington are currently “at the zero mark,” the Kremlin aide said, while pointing out that phone conversations aren’t enough to improve the situation.

Russian-American relations further deteriorated after Washington launched 59 Tomahawk missiles at Syria’s Shayrat Airbase near the city of Homs on April 7. The move came in retaliation to what Washington claimed was a Syrian government-orchestrated chemical weapons attack on Khan Shaykhun, which killed dozens of people. Damascus has firmly and repeatedly denied those allegations, while Moscow has repeatedly called for an international investigation to be conducted into the incident.

The populations of both nations see each other as foes, according to the latest polls. While 69 percent of Russian respondents consider America among hostile countries, according to a poll conducted by Russian research center Levada, a third of Americans surveyed said they view Russia as “unfriendly,” and a fifth regard it as an “enemy,” pollster YouGov has found.

Nasdaq has issued a market-wide trading halt amid what appears to be a “glitch” that sent a number of the largest Nasdaq-listed stocks to crash or spike to exactly $123.47 per share.

This move crashed the value of companies including Amazon and Apple, sparked chaos in Microsoft, while sending Zynga rocketing up more than 3000%.

On the eve of the US Independence Day holiday and in after-hours trading, The FT reports that market data show that companies such as Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, eBay and Zynga were repriced at $123.47.

The Bloomberg data terminal listed either “market wide circuit breaker halt — level 2” or “volatility trading pause” on all the stocks affected.



The glitch did not affect any market trading, including after hours.

The mysterious reset to $123.47 per share meant that Amazon in theory saw its share price marked down 87.2 per cent…

while shares in Apple fell 14.3 per cent…

But Nasdaq-listed Microsoft had jumped 79.1 per cent — which would value the company at nearly $1tn…

As Bloomberg reports, the apparent swings triggered trading halts in some securities, according to automatically generated messages. The halts are a mechanism exchanges use to limit the impact of particularly volatile sessions. A system status alert on Nasdaq’s website said that systems were operating normally at 8:23 p.m. ET. After-market hours on Nasdaq typically last from 4 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.

In a statement, Nasdaq said the glitch was related to “improper use of test data” sent out to third party data providers, and said it was working to “ensure a prompt resolution of this matter”. In cases of any clearly erroneous data, trades made are cancelled.

As a reminder this is not the first time ‘glitches’ have occurred on holidays… remember gold on Thanksgiving 2014.

Archeologists in China’s Shandong province unearthed skeletal remains of ‘giant’ humans who lived 5,000 years ago.

Since 2016, archeologists have been excavating a large site in the east of the country. The site contains the ruins of 104 houses, 205 graves and 20 sacrificial pits.

Dating from the late neolithic period, some 5,000 years ago, the relics belong to an ancient culture called the Longshan. Recently, scientists discovered human bones that are unusually tall and strong.

Analysis put the height of at least one man at 1.9 meters (6ft 3in), while quite a few others were 1.8 meters or taller. Considering the average height for a European in the late neolithic era was 1.65m these ancient humans would have towered above their counterparts.

Even today the average height for a man in Shandong is 1.75m, while China’s national average is 1.72m, according to China Daily.

“This is just based on the bone structure. If he was a living person, his height would certainly exceed 1.9 meters,” said Fang Hui, head of Shandong University’s school of history and culture, as cited by China Daily.

The taller men were found in larger tombs than the others, leading researchers to speculate that their height afforded them a higher status within the community.

Not all was rosy for the vertically privileged few though, as scientists discovered obvious damage to skull and leg bones which may have been down to power struggles between high-ranking individuals, as the old adage goes ‘the bigger they are, the harder they fall.’

Monday night on Fox News Channel, “Tucker Carlson Tonight” host Tucker Carlson mocked CNN for their analysts and reporters claiming President Donald Trump’s tweet of a video that showed him wrestling a man with a CNN logo superimposed over his head was a danger to journalists.

Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com

Carlson said, “Donald Trump’s feud with the media got even weirder and more intense over the weekend after the president tweeted a video of his staged brawl with wrestling mogul Vince McMahon with a CNN logo superimposed over McMahon’s face. It was a little confusing since CNN and pro wrestling could not be more different. One is an entertainment venture that promotes over-the-top fictional narratives and rigs its fights. The other is the WWE, but whatever. There’s a word for this. It’s called trolling, the digital version of getting someone’s goat. Should the president take time from running the free world to drive the media insane? Maybe not. Probably not. But he obviously enjoys it quite a bit.”

Another city is joining the nationwide movement to purge streets, statues and monuments honoring Confederate generals: Hollywood.

“It is time to change the names and the time is now,” Commissioner Debra Case said Monday during a City Hall meeting that drew prominent elected officials from around the county. “We must do the right thing and we must do it now.”

It wasn’t quick and it wasn’t easy.

But on Monday, more than a week after a raucous protest at City Hall that resulted in five arrests, Hollywood commissioners agreed to rename streets honoring three Civil War-era generals: Robert E. Lee, John Bell Hood and Nathan Bedford Forrest, who was also first grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.

Moscow and Beijing have agreed that North Korea should freeze its nuclear and missile programs, while the US and South Korea should abstain from holding war games in the region, Russian President Vladimir Putin said.

“We’ve agreed to promote our joint initiative, based on Russian step-by-step Korean settlement plan and Chinese ideas to simultaneously freeze North Korean nuclear and missile activities, and US and South Korean joint military drills,” Putin said at a press conference after meeting with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, in Moscow.

“We believe that the outer world is turbulent, local conflicts are emerging constantly, such issues as the Korean peninsula problem, Syrian question, remain very complex,” Xi Jinping said.

Russia’s president stressed that the two countries have either the same, or very close positions on many international issues.

“We intend to further develop our foreign policy coordination,” Putin said.

Moscow and Beijing stressed the importance of taking North Korea’s concerns over its safety into consideration, calling them “justified.”

“The two sides stress that justified North Korean concerns should be respected,” a joint statement by Russia’s and China’s foreign ministers reads. “Other countries should make certain moves to resume the negotiations, creating a peaceful disposition and mutual trust.”

“A possibility of the use of military measures to solve the problems of the Korean Peninsula must be ruled out,” the joint statement stressed.

While condemning Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile tests as violating UN Security Council resolutions, Moscow and Beijing urged the United States to immediately halt its deployment of THAAD anti-missile systems to South Korea.

“The sides agree that the deployment of THAAD anti-missile systems to Northeast Asia gravely damages strategic safety interests of regional powers, including Russia and China and do not contribute to the de-nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, as well as towards establishing peace and stability in the region,” the statement reads.

“Russia and China oppose the deployment of the said systems and call on the countries involved to immediately halt and cancel the process of their deployment.”

Russia and China’s calls for de-escalation and negotiation are clearly a step into right direction if the ongoing Korean crisis is to be untangled, Asia-Pacific defense consultant Jack Midgley believes.

“North Korea now has at least a limited ballistic missile capability; they have at least a limited nuclear weapons capability. The question is: how will the world deal with the emergence of this new set of facts,” Midgley said, adding “the experience of the last 60 years is very consistent there – it’s that the only way forward that actually works is to bring the parties together and to negotiate.”

Many Americans gathering to celebrate Independence Day will mark the holiday at Arlington National Cemetery. But for visitors feeling patriotic, there is one item that is banned on the hallowed grounds: a waving American flag.

Earl Granville, a retired Army staff sergeant and veterans advocate who lost his leg in a bombing in Afghanistan, said that he was surprised to learn about the obscure federal law that prohibits visitors from carrying an unfurled U.S. flag at the cemetery.

“There’s absolutely, positively nothing disrespectful whatsoever about carrying the colors to the cemetery where our fallen armed forces are buried,” Granville said.

The law — 38 U.S. Code § 2413 — emerged in 2006 when former U.S. Rep. Mike D. Rogers (R-Mich.) grew angry after watching mourners at a military burial face “chants and taunting and some of the most vile things I have ever heard,” Rogers told the Associated Press at the time.

Austria has mobilized its military to maintain security along its border with Italy as the explosion of migrants crossing over from Africa reaches catastrophic proportions.

The Austrian government has moved 750 troops and four Pandur armored vehicles into the Tyrol region, where they can quickly deploy to the Brenner Pass, the primary connector between Austria and Italy through the Alps, if necessary.

“We need to prepare for the migration development in Italy, and I expect very promptly that border controls will be activated and assistance requested,” said Austrian Defense Minister Hans Peter Doskozil in comments to local press.

His spokesman said the flood of migrants into Italy is unsustainable, and that riot tanks would have to be deployed.

“These are not battle tanks,” he said. “These are armoured vehicles without weapons which could block roads. These were already used during the refugee crisis of 2015/16 at the Spielfeld border crossing (with Slovenia).”

Italy’s foreign ministry has summoned the Austrian ambassador to discuss Vienna’s statements and movements.

The UN International Organization for Migration has announced that over 100,000 migrants have entered Europe in the first six months of 2017 via the Mediterranean, with nearly 85% arriving in Italy from Libya alone.

At the same time, the UN refugee agency just released a new report stating that at least seven out of 10 illegal immigrants from Africa are not refugees at all, but instead are economic migrants, as Infowars has documented at length.

Austria’s decision to militarily fortify its border comes on the heels of a recent meeting between six central European nations seeking to form a new anti-migrant defense coalition.

Defense ministers and officials from Austria, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Slovenia, and Croatia met in Prague earlier this month to discuss the details of the Central European Defence Cooperation (CEDC) that will act as “the framework of civil-military cooperation” between the nations who seek to handle the on-going crisis in a markedly different manner than Brussels and other EU member states, such as Germany, Sweden and Italy.

“At the meeting, the participants issued a short declaration which welcomes the Joint Action Plan and calls on the interior ministers of the involved countries to finalize it in the shortest time possible,” read a statement from the Hungarian Ministry of Defense regarding the meeting and developments to come. “The declaration takes note of the unified situation assessment, which facilitates the quick and joint mobilization of civilian, police and military capabilities, and states that the most important task is the protection of the external borders of the EU and the elimination of the root causes of migration in the sending countries.”

“Finally, the participants of the meeting talked about the wider context of Europe’s security situation and the next steps in strengthening the European common security and defence policy.”

A leading eco-toxicologist has warned that the quantity of synthetic chemicals entering our watershed is feminizing fish populations to such a degree that several species now boast transgender and intersex fish, with eggs in their testicles.

“If you look in terms of what gets into a fish’s liver or gonad, the analysis of the chemicals it contains is a bit of a blueprint in terms of what’s flushed down the toilet,” Professor Charles Tyler, of the University of Exeter said, speaking to The Independent.

“We’re starting to establish not just effects on gender, but that they can also affect other physiological processes in the fish as well,” he added.

Tyler will give a keynote speech on the topic of ‘transgender’ or ‘intersex’ fish at the 50th Anniversary Symposium of the Fisheries Society in the British Isles at Exeter University from July 3 to 7.

Tyler participated in the research project, ‘Roach, Sex, and Gender-Bending Chemicals: The Feminization of Wild Fish in English Rivers’ in 2008 in which one fifth of the male fish studied possessed feminized traits including, but not limited to, reduced sperm quality, decreased aggression and competitive behavior, which impeded their success when breeding. Some male fish had even begun producing eggs.

“It all depends how feminized they become. If they are moderately to severely feminized, they are compromised as individuals and they really struggle to pass on their genes,” Tyler said. “One thing scientists are becoming much, much more conscious of now … is wildlife populations are exposed to a combination of stresses.”

The research identified more than 200 chemicals in river water which had characteristics similar to estrogen and antidepressants.

Endocrine disruptors, the chemicals found in pesticides, detergents, certain foods, the contraceptive pill and cosmetics are the type of chemical responsible for the marked change in sexuality and behavior of fish.

A separate study from 2010 found that more than 80 percent of male bass fish in the Potomac river in Washington DC exhibited female traits, including growing eggs in their testes as a result of rainwater and sewage water containing a mix of endocrine disruptors entering the area’s watershed.

Catalonia, a region of northeastern Spain, will declare immediate independence if voters approve a referendum in October.

The autonomous area best known for the city of Barcelona is controlled by those seeking to forge a new nation separate from Spain.

“If the majority of votes are for creating a Catalan republic, obviously independence will have to be declared immediately,” said Gabriela Serra, a member of the independence coalition governing Catalonia.

Catalonia has always had its own distinctive culture and language (Catalan) – and sovereign nations are defined by their homogenous identities.

The region was once a principality with its own laws and customs that flourished until power over the Iberian peninsula was centralized by the Spanish crown.

But to gain independence again, Catalonia must overcome several challenges since the upcoming referendum was not approved by Spain.

Without Madrid’s help, the independence coalition will need to create a commission to provide the ballot boxes and oversee the election – all while preventing loyalist saboteurs from rigging the vote.

Spain – and likely the EU by extension – doesn’t want an independent Catalonia and right now voters are split on the issue, and it’s easy for loyalists to steal an election when it’s that close.

“Madrid has remained steadfast in its opposition to such a vote, considering it a threat to Spain’s unity, and this time is no different,” reported France 24.

The Drudge Report conducted a poll asking readers if they would like to see President Trump continue using social media or not, and the message is loud and clear: America loves Trump tweets.

With nearly half a million votes cast at the time of this writing, support for the President’s use of socials stands at a stunning 77.45% with less than one in four respondents wishing he would stop.

The results starkly contradict findings from a Fox News phone poll of 1,017 viewers, 71% of whom felt that Trump was ‘hurting his agenda’ by using Twitter. The average age of Fox viewers is 68.

The Drudge poll was launched in the wake a liberal meltdown after Trump’s tweets about affianced MSNBC co-hosts “low IQ Crazy Mika” Brzezinski and “Pyscho Joe” Scarborough, and after the initial 175,000 votes had been cast, 74.46% backed Trump tweets.

And then Trump ‘body-slammed’ CNN.

President Trump went all-in on Sunday, posting one of his most popular tweets of all time – a user-created video parody of Trump body-slamming pro wrestling tycoon Vince McMahon with McMahon’s head replaced by a CNN logo.

Despite leftists, media hacks, and celebrities reaching new stages of nuclear outrage, positive votes in the Drudge poll have continued to pour in, boosting endorsement of Trump’s “Modern Day Presidential” approach to connecting directly with the American public.

After a week in which investigative reporters at Project Veritas dropped bombshell after bombshell on CNN, and the globalist press were savaged by the alt media and watchdogs alike, Trump has utilized socials to turn up the heat on the #FakeNews media – a move that is likely emboldening his supporters to stay involved and keep a bright spotlight pointed at the anti-American narrative manipulators who have been deceiving them for decades.

“The fake media is trying to silence us but we will not let them,” Trump said during a speech at the Celebrate Freedom Rally on Saturday. “The people know the truth. The fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House, but I’m president and they’re not.”

“The dishonest media will not stop us from accomplishing our objectives on behalf of the American people,” he continued. “Their agenda is not your agenda.”

….the 2016 election with interviews, speeches and social media. I had to beat #FakeNews, and did. We will continue to WIN! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 1, 2017

“The FAKE & FRAUDULENT NEWS MEDIA is working hard to convince Republicans and others I should not use social media – but remember, I won the 2016 election with interviews, speeches and social media,” Trump Tweeted on Saturday. “I had to beat # FakeNews, and did. We will continue to WIN!”

The media’s obsession with Trump tweets has provided an effective smoke screen while he implements the America First agenda and dismantles destructive globalist programs, most recently and aggressively phased in by Barack Obama.

“Last week was a great example: While the fake journalists at the NYTimes, CNN, MSNBC, the WaPo and the three broadcast networks gave most of their print space and air time to rants about the President’s latest tweets about Mika and Joe, the President’s EPA announced the full repeal of the horrible Obama-era power grab called the Waters Of The United States rule,” writes energy analyst David Blackmon. “This massive regulation would have basically given the EPA authority to regulate any temporary or permanent body of water in the entire nation, including puddles in your lawn, drainage ditches, overflowing swimming pools, and even city streets that are designed to carry storm water that ultimately drains into rivers and lakes.”

Trump’s most recent tweet was an offer to assist the family of Charlie Gard, a dying baby from the UK whose parents are seeking potentially life-saving experimental treatment for Charlie in the United States, but have been blocked from traveling to do so by UK and EU courts who have ordered that the boy’s life support be turned off despite the Gards raising over $1 million dollars for his treatment.

If we can help little #CharlieGard, as per our friends in the U.K. and the Pope, we would be delighted to do so. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2017

In addition to declaring that the WWE wrestling meme tweeted by President Trump last week was an ‘incitement to violence’, CNN has now claimed that it also raises “questions” about “racism, bigotry, and antisemitism.”

Why is a gif of Trump ‘clotheslining’ CNN (really Vince McMahon) in a staged fight probably racist? Because someone else who posted it on Reddit has previously posted offensive content, CNN reports.

CNN correspondent Tom Foreman pointed to a report by thevirulently left wing and anti-Trump organisation the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) which has claimed the Reddit user “is like many other online bigots who use platforms like Reddit to anonymously share their hateful words and images.”

It was only a matter of time folks… CNN: Trump's Wrestling Meme May Be Racist, Antisemitic https://t.co/DdCFgavmKK via @BreitbartNews — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 3, 2017

The ADL claims that “For more than a year, this Reddit user has violated the platform’s terms of service by posting the type of hate against Muslims, African-Americans, Jews and others…”

“In fact, the individual posted an image collage of CNN journalists and employees labeling them with a Star of David and writing, “Something strange about CNN…can’t quite put my finger on it…”

“We have been analyzing the online activities of this individual and found a consistent record of racism, anti-Semitism and bigotry for more than a year on Reddit,” said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO.

Besides the fact that the President obviously has no knowledge of or connections to this individual, there is no actual evidence that this individual created the wrestling Trump meme at all, as it has been floating around the internet for some time.

In addition, the ADL is notorious for labeling everyone and everything it does not agree with as racist.

Last year the organisation demanded that Trump stop using the phrase “America First” because it’s “anti-Semitic.” The ADL also declared the Pepe the Frog meme to be a ‘hate symbol’ akin to the swastika and burning crosses.

The ADL routinely mixes in non-violent activist movements with white supremacists and genuinely violent and distasteful groups to demonize big government critics, constitutionalists and libertarians as domestic extremists. The organization is obsessed with eviscerating the free speech of its political adversaries.

The ADL is an agenda-driven political outfit posing as an impartial organisation. In other words, it is a fake watchdog.

No matter. It seems CNN will go to any lengths in its obstruction campaign against Trump, including continuing to cite this thoroughly discredited organisation’s output, and openly calling the President a racist.

Will President Trump help medically transport a 10-month-baby from London to the U.S. before the government and his doctors pull the plug on his life support?

That’s the question being raised on Twitter Monday. And it wouldn’t be the first time Trump has intervened to medically transport a sick child for treatment.

Little Charlie Gard – a 10-month-old baby in London who has been blocked from traveling to the U.S. to receive potentially life-saving treatment and could be days from the end of his life – captured the attention of Trump and the pope Monday.

President Donald Trump’s first face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week will be brimming with global intrigue, but the White House says there’s “no specific agenda.”

So in the absence of a set list of topics, what are two of the world’s most famously unpredictable leaders to discuss?

Trump, who prefers to have neatly packaged achievements to pair with high-profile meetings, may be looking for some concessions from Russia to show he’s delivering progress and helping restore a productive relationship between the two powers. Putin would almost surely want something in return, and there’s a long list of “irritants” between the two countries that they could potentially resolve.

Arrests of illegal immigrants have more than doubled in San Diego, California, under President Trump’s immigration orders.

In a report by the San Diego Union-Tribune, new data shows that illegal immigrants in southern California are being arrested at roughly the same rate before former President Obama’s era of relaxed border policies.

Between February and May, nearly 550 illegal immigrants were arrested in San Diego alone by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.

Compare that to the number of illegal immigrants arrested in that same time period last year, where only 242 foreign nationals were arrested. In 2015, during the same time frame, ICE agents only arrested 267 illegal immigrants.

Amid North Korea’s repeated missile launches, evacuation drills conducted with the participation of local residents and based on the scenario that a missile strike is imminent are being held in many places across the nation.

Such drills have already been conducted in nine prefectures, and there are more scheduled to be carried out in at least 11 prefectures.

This month, the nation’s first drill in which people will evacuate to an underground mall is scheduled to occur in Takaoka, Toyama Prefecture.

Since the start of this year, North Korea has fired ballistic missiles that left and reentered the atmosphere nine times.

On Monday night, following news of the latest North Korean ballistic missile launch which as discussed earlier landed in the Sea of Japan, and specifically Japan’s quasi-sovereign Economic Exclusion Zone, Trump tweeted his reaction to the latest provocation, which probably falls under the “modern day presidential” umbrella.





Trump decided to eschew conventional diplomacy, and stated matter of facty, that “North Korea has just launched another missile” then prioeeded to ask of Kim Jong-Un, “does this guy have anything better to do with his life?”

North Korea has just launched another missile. Does this guy have anything better to do with his life? Hard to believe that South Korea….. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 4, 2017

Apparently the answer is no, which may explain why it was recently revealed that South Korea’s previous president was seriously contemplating the assassinating Kim.

In his second tweet, Trump added “gard to believe that South Korea and Japan will put up with this much longer. Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!.”

….and Japan will put up with this much longer. Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 4, 2017

Or perhaps after China slammed over the weekend the recent multi-billion US sale of weapons to China’s nemesis Taiwan, not to mention the deployment of a US missile-destroyer in the South China Seas which was promptly intercepted by Chinese forces, as well as Trump’s sanctioning of several Chinese entities for “doing business with North Korea, maybe China won’t do anything at all, and instead will cultivate and fund local and not so local terrorist to pick up the “global cleansing” role.

A new survey conducted by Ipsos Mori has revealed some staggering insights into how the French view Islam, society and migration in general.

60% of the French believe Islam is incompatible with French society, which is incredibly high given that only 8% would say the same about Catholicism and 19% about Judaism.

A further breakdown of the figures reveals that 74% of people believe that Islam seeks to impose its will on others, as opposed to 18% of people who believed the same about Catholicism.

The French are also fed up with mass immigration it would seem, 65% feel there are too many foreign people in France, according to the poll, which is down slightly from the 70% who said the same in 2013. (We guess 4 years of mass immigration would skew the results a little bit!)

Contrary to what the hard left would have you believe, attitudes are similar across all professions, from professionals to labourers:

The French also believe it is becoming harder to integrate migrants into French society, with 61% say that they believe immigrants do not make an effort to integrate properly into French life.

An explanatory note for the document says: “The 2017 wave of Fractures Français (report) reveals a generalised revival of confidence in the political, economic and regal institutions and a decline of the “declinist”. These positive movements do not, however, erase the pessimism which is still very marked within French society.”

Looks like Monsieur Macron still has a long way to go in restoring French confidence in their society, and the movement in attitudes suggests that papering over the cracks isn’t going to work forever…

The Russian Defense Ministry has stated that North Korea launched an intermediate range missile on Tuesday morning. The missile flew around 535 kilometers, reaching an altitude of 510 kilometers, and fell into the Sea of Japan, according to military data.

The missile test carried out by Pyongyang on Tuesday morning did not pose a threat to Russia, the defense ministry said in a statement.

“The launch was carried out in a direction away from Russia’s borders, and did not pose a threat to the Russian Federation,” the Russian military stated.

Russia’s missile warning system tracked the launch from North Korean territory, according to the military officials.

“The launch of a ballistic missile, carried out on July 4 at 3:46am Moscow time from a North Korean firing ground was recorded and tracked by Russia’s missile warning system,” an MoD statement said.

North Korea claimed that it had successfully launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile on Tuesday morning. Pyongyang said its Hwasong-14 ICBM flew some 933 kilometers in 39 minutes reaching an altitude of 2,802 kilometers, according to the country’s state television.

North Korea has repeatedly warned the US and its Asian allies, which conduct joint drills near the Korean Peninsula, that it would launch more missile and nuclear tests.

An intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launched from North Korea would be able to reach and strike the United States, as such missiles can cover a distance of more than of 5,500 kilometers, while intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBM) have a much shorter range and pose no threat to the US.

The US military identified the projectile fired by North Korea as a single, land-based, intermediate range ballistic missile. American military data indicates that it flew some 930 kilometers in 37 minutes before falling into the Sea of Japan.

US President Donald Trump mocked North Korea’s latest missile test immediately after the launch, suggesting that the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, doesn’t have “anything better to do with his life” than fire off missiles.

North Korea has just launched another missile. Does this guy have anything better to do with his life? Hard to believe that South Korea….. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 4, 2017

Trump also urged China to exert more pressure on the North and “end this nonsense once and for all.” Meanwhile, Beijing called for calm and restraint from all sides, while condemning North Korea’s latest test, which violated UN Security Council resolutions.

The Election Integrity Project (EIP), a California-based volunteer organization that aims to increase transparency in the voting process, has slammed a decision by California Secretary of State Alex Padilla to refuse to cooperate with President Donald Trump’s Commission on Election Integrity in its efforts to investigate claims of voter fraud.

In a statement, the EIP said (original emphasis):

California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, along 25+ other Secretaries of State (SOS) has refused to cooperate with the bipartisan President’s Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. He was asked to simply supply the state’s voter list to the Commission so it can investigate practices that could lead to improper or fraudulent registrations and voting. The requested information is, for the most part, public information, and no more than any candidate, education organization, research organization, among others, are privy to. …

Secretary Padilla states that he does not want to “legitimize already debunked claims of massive voter fraud.” California’s Election Integrity Project (EIP) asks not only when, where and how did the “debunking” take place, but more importantly, why protest an opportunity to conclusively prove through third party investigation his assertion that there is no election fraud in California? What does the Secretary have to hide?

Over the past 20 years, European cities have slowly become more ethnically diverse, as EU governments open their borders to foreign populations.

And as this process has taken place, the authorities have been quick to cover up any crimes that have been committed by these populations. For instance, Swedish police are no longer allowed to describe the ethnic background of the criminals they catch, and most notably, the German government and press were desperate to cover up hundreds sexual assaults that occurred in Cologne in 2015.

However, there are certain statistics that can’t be covered up. A government can try to conceal the connection between crimes and specific ethnic groups, but they can’t cover up the overall crime statistics of an entire city. Plus, politically correct governments can’t really hide the ethnic diversity of their cities. That’s something that their progressive sensibilities command them to promote.

Fortunately, sometimes those two factors come together to give us all a good look at the relationship between immigration and crime in Europe, despite the best efforts of European governments to conceal that connection. For example, the German government recently revealed that more than half of the population of Frankfurt has a foreign background, arguably making it the most diverse major city in Germany.

For the first time, more than half of Frankfurt residents now have a migrant background, according to official data from the city’s Office of Statistics and Elections. Presenting the figures, which show that 51.2 per cent of people living in Frankfurt have a migrant background, the city’s secretary of integration Sylvia Weber said: “We have minorities with relatively large numbers in Frankfurt but no group with a clear majority.” Representing 13 per cent of the population, Turks are the city’s largest non-German minority, and 61 per cent of residents who were born abroad are citizens of other European Union (EU) countries.

And on top of that, the data reveals that these people aren’t thriving in Germany. 49% of people with foreign backgrounds in Frankfurt live below the poverty line, compared to 23% of native Germans, and they are significantly more likely to be unemployed. But that’s not the real kicker. Frankfurt was a diverse city long before the migrant crisis reached its peak, and even then it had a startling crime rate.

The 2013 national crime figures, which were leaked to Welt newspaper earlier this week, show just under six million crimes were recorded in Germany last year. When broken down to the number of crimes per 100,000 inhabitants, Frankfurt am Main rates as the most dangerous city in Germany with 16,292 crimes per 100,000 people. Its high ranking was put down to its red light district and the large airport.

Of course if you brought this fact up to most leftists, they would call you a racist. But it has nothing to do with race. The real problem is that Germany hasn’t properly vetted their immigrants, nor have they successfully assimilated them. Germany is inviting people into their country who have no respect for German law, and they aren’t pressuring them to join German culture. And the result is rather predictable. Germany has a large foreign population that is young, jobless, alienated from mainstream culture, and more likely to commit crimes.

What we’re seeing in Frankfurt is the future of Europe, if EU nations continue to celebrate multiculturalism and leave their borders wide open. It will be a divided continent, filled with ethnic enclaves, no-go zones, civil unrest, and crime. If they don’t see the folly of multiculturalism, within a generation every city in Europe will be like Frankfurt, or perhaps even worse.

The University of California, Berkeley is trying to dismiss a free speech lawsuit filed following the cancellation of Ann Coulter’s speech at the school in April.

UC Berkeley attorneys—including Janet Napolitano, system president of the University of California, and Nicholas Dirks, chancellor of UC Berkeley—insist the claims made by Young America’s Foundation and the Berkeley College Republicans are “moot,” according to a court document obtained by Campus Reform Friday.

“The alleged restrictions were viewpoint neutral because they were not motivated by disagreement with the speaker’s viewpoint,” said the attorneys.

The attorneys assert that the cancellation Coulter’s speech had nothing to do with the author’s political views, arguing that there were instead “constitutional ‘time, place, and, manner regulations’” which restricted her speech.

“This weak attempt by the University of California, Berkeley to brush off their egregious free speech violations is staggering but unfortunately unsurprising given their demonstrated pattern of suppressing the First Amendment rights of conservatives on campus,” said Spencer Brown, spokesman for Young America’s Foundation. “As Young America’s Foundation has done throughout the last half-century, YAF will continue to stand up for students’ rights when their own schools engage in flagrant obstruction of free expression.”

Dan Mogulof, an assistant vice chancellor at Berkeley, said in a statement to The Daily Caller News Foundation that recent events at UC Berkeley have shown there is “insufficient awareness” as to the school’s speaker policies. He also acknowledged that policies currently in place “should be unified, standardized, and clarified.”

“Statements reasserting and emphasizing our existing policies and practices that make clear speaker viewpoints will not influence decisions relating to event approval or required security measures” will be added to the policy, according to Mogulof, a statement that suggests UC Berkeley administrators believe the school never did discriminate based on the political viewpoint of potential speakers.

“[UC Berkeley police] place the safety and well-being of our students as the lead priority which can, at rare times, lead the department to forego short-term arrests,” said Mogulof, denying the “stand down policy” that observers suspected the police to have.

“These decisions are made on a case-by-case basis by command staff based on their professional assessment, and suffice it to say there is nothing precluding them form effecting arrests if they believe that can be done with creating serious risk and danger for innocent bystanders and/or those who elect to engage in lawful protest.”

The assistant vice chancellor noted that while a new draft policy for campus speakers is not yet available for public consumption, the school intends to implement an interim policy by Aug. 13 before the start of the fall semester.

Berkeley has been the site of several protests and altercations between Donald Trump supporters and antifascists in 2017, including the riot that canceled conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos’ February speech, a March 4 Trump conflict, and a Patriots Day rally skirmish in April.

The Daily Caller News Foundation reached out to UC Berkeley for comment, but received none in time for press.

During their “extensive discussion,” Trump and the German leader “addressed climate issues, the Women’s Entrepreneurship Financing Initiative, and trade, including global steel overcapacity.”

Their phone call comes after Reuters reported earlier in the day that the German election program produced by chancellor’s party does not refer to the United States as a “friend.”

The president is expected to meet Merkel this week before the summit, according to Reuters.

The Department of Justice asked a federal judge in Hawaii to deny the state’s request for clarification on President Trump’s travel ban Monday, saying any order limiting the scope of the travel restrictions should be considered by the Supreme Court.

Hawaii is challenging the administration’s enforcement of the ban, which finally went into effect on Thursday after being bogged down by legal challenges for months.

Visa applicants from specific countries must now prove a “bonda fide” familial relationship to be accepted. The state argues that the White House interpreted the definition of close family members too narrowly.

In a filing Monday responding to Hawaii’s challenge, the administration said its definition of “close family member” is consistent with the Immigration and Nationality Act, Bloomberg reported.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC), in charge of making the rules for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in South Korea, said that there will be no sex or gender testing required for the upcoming games.

“With regard to Hyperandrogenism in female athletes, there were no regulations in place at the Olympic Games Rio 2016 and there will be no regulations in place at the Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018 as we are still awaiting the resolution of the Dutee Chand case,” the IOC wrote in a June email in response to an inquiry into how it would regulate the upcoming Olympics.

The response follows controversy that sparked after 800-meter South African runner Caster Semenya won gold at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil. Semenya’s intersex condition causes her to produce more testosterone (hyperandrogenism) than most women, prompting questions about whether she had an unfair biological advantage.

“These kind of people should not run with us,” Italian middle-distance runner Elisa Cusma said. “For me, she is not a woman. She is a man.”

In the past, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the world’s governing body for track and field, sought to preserve the male-female division by administering gynecological exams, chromosome tests, or hormone tests to ensure fair competition.

Before the Rio Olympics, women like Semenya whose functional levels of the hormone are higher than 10 nmols/L were barred from international competition. Between 2011 and 2015, the IAAF ruled that any woman with less than 10 nanomoles of testosterone per liter of blood could compete in women’s events. Sex testing was not required of any athletes at the Rio Olympics, however, meaning intersex track athletes could compete with their natural testosterone levels.

Prior to IAFF regulations, Semenya dominated the 800m race at the world championships in Berlin, but she failed to move beyond the semifinals in Beijing after testosterone limits were implemented. When the testosterone rule was suspended in 2015, she returned to form, winning the 400m, 800m, and 1500m races at the African Championships — all on the same day — and an olympic gold the following year.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport suspended the IAAF’s testosterone rule in 2014, citing a lack scientific evidence to suggest that women with high levels of the hormone have a significant competitive advantage. The IAAF argued that testosterone is the most important boost to athletic performance, but the court stated that unless it could prove an average performance gap of 10 to 12 percent between male and female runners, there was not sufficient “evidence about the degree of the advantage.”

This decision came after an Indian sprinter named Dutee Chand said the federation unfairly discriminated against women like her with higher testosterone levels. The IAAF rebuked the court’s decision, pointing to two large studies in Russia and South Korea showing that most elite female athletes had testosterone levels between 0.1 and 3.08 nmol/L and that 99 percent of female athletes had testosterone below 3.08 nmol/L. They argued the 10 nmol/L cap for women was “too generous.”

The court gave the IAAF a deadline of July 2017 to come up with more evidence otherwise the rule barring competition would be permanently void.

In February, the International Olympics Committee agreed to stop regulating women’s natural testosterone levels until the IAAF case was resolved.

Testosterone, found in both men and women has been linked with increased muscle, bone mass, and competitive drive. The average male produces much more of it than the average female, roughly 35 nmol/L. Women usually produce less than 3 nmol/L.

Sweden-based Professor Martin Ritzén, a specialist in pediatric endocrinology, testified on behalf of the IAAF and said the probability of a healthy woman reaching 10 nmol/L of testosterone was “zero.” Another IAAF expert witness, professor of gynecology Angelica Hirschberg, noted that she had never seen such a high level of the hormone in someone with healthy ovaries and normal adrenal glands.

IAAF argued that transgender and intersex athletes have an unfair advantage in part because testosterone is linked with lean body mass, increased strength, speed, and power. This is why many athletes try to illegally take synthetic versions of the hormone to boost their performance, the IAAF contended.

Joanna Harper, a doctor and transgender woman who competed in male distance running events for decades, told the Court of Arbitration that when she started taking a testosterone blocker and estrogen as part of her transition, she became “noticeably slower.” Harper collated data from seven other transgender runners for a study published in the “Journal of Sporting Cultures and Identities” and found that all of them had slower times competing as females.

Other experts question whether it’s fair to equate the experience of transgender women with the experience of intersex women. They argue that the two different populations cannot be compared and that a runner’s performance may take a hit from the psychological toll of being outed to the world as intersex.

The IOC Medical Commission held a consensus meeting in 2010 on female hyperandrogenism and implemented the IOC Regulations on Female Hyperandrogenism prior to the 2012 London Olympic Games, according to the IOC’s email. The regulations were published in September 2013 and updated for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games.

“In November 2015, the IOC Medical and Scientific Commission convened an expert group to review the available scientific and clinical evidence on Sex Reassignment and Hyperandrogenism in female athletes. Although there was not unanimity of opinion on all details discussed the statement reflects a consensus (Consensus Statement) of those participating. However, following the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) interim award in the Chand v AFI and IAAF case, the IOC was not in a position to introduce rules on hyperandrogenism until the issues of the case are resolved,” the email concluded.

Unless the Olympic Committee changes its mind before 2018, athletes competing in the South Korea Winter Olympics will not be required to undergo sex testing or adhere to testosterone limits.

Three car bombs exploded in Damascus on Sunday, state media said, killing at least seven people in the first suicide bombings in the Syrian capital since jihadists attacked in March.

Security forces stopped the terrorists from reaching their targets which would have led to more deaths, officials told state TV, saying the bombers had aimed to hit busy areas on the first day back to work after the Eid al-Fitr holiday.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Damascus was hit by two separate, multiple suicide bomb attacks in March, one of them claimed by the ISIS terrorist group and the other by the Islamic insurgent alliance Tahrir al-Sham.

ISIS terrorists were battling to hold on to the last few streets under their control in the Old City of Mosul on Monday, in what looked like a hopeless last stand in their former stronghold.

In fierce fighting, Iraqi army units forced the insurgents back, cornering them in a shrinking rectangle no more than 300 meters (yards) wide and 500 meters long by the Tigris river, according to a map published by the military media office.

Smoke covered parts of the Old City, rocked by air strikes and artillery salvos through the morning.

The number of ISIS terrorists fighting in Mosul has dwindled from thousands at the start of the government offensive more than eight months ago to a mere couple of hundred now, according to the Iraqi military.

President Donald Trump plans to focus on Syria during his meeting this week with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit.

Although an official outline for the discussion has not yet been released, administration officials say Trump will bring up the ongoing conflict and question Putin’s support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

The meeting, set to take place on the sidelines in Hamburg, Germany, was confirmed last week by national security adviser H.R. McMaster.

Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov responded to reports of Trump’s intended focus Monday by calling the topic “reasonable.”

“I’ve heard the Americans want to raise the issues of terrorism and Syria,” he said. “It seems to me that would be pretty reasonable.”

Ushakov asserted that Putin intends to request that the United States return two diplomatic compounds seized as part of the Obama administration’s sanctions over alleged election meddling. The Kremlin aide, who also discussed the 35 expelled Russian diplomats, stated that such a move by the White House would save Russia “from the need to retaliate.”

“We have a lot of issues, which should be discussed at the highest level…” Ushakov added. “That’s why this meeting, this first personal contact, is so important.”

Relations between the two countries remain strained following the US missile strike against a Syrian airbase in April accused of facilitating a chemical weapons attack.

While the White House and Kremlin have signaled a desire for détente, conflicting agendas have thus far stalled such attempts.

An analysis of White House salary data reveals that President Donald Trump’s administration is spending $5 million less of taxpayer money on his staff than his predecessor.

Trump employs 377 people at the White House, with a total of $35.8 million, while former President Barack Obama paid $40.9 million for 476 employees in 2015, according to data analyzed by Open the Books.

Another key difference between the Obama and Trump White House is the first lady’s staff. Michelle Obama retained 24 staffers in the first year of the Obama White House. Melania Trump currently employs four—a chief of staff who is also listed as adviser to the president, a deputy chief of staff, a communications director, and a scheduler.

“Projected four-year savings on the White House payroll could top $22 million,” Adam Andrzejewski, CEO of Open the Books, writes for Forbes. Those projected savings include Trump’s promise to accept $1 in salary and give the remainder back to the U.S. Treasury.

Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, both advisers to the president, are not accepting any salary. Most top White House staff—including Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, Omarosa Manigault, Reince Priebus, Sean Spicer, and 17 others—make $179,000 annually.

Obama had the same number of top advisers at this stage of his presidency in 2009, but he also appointed many “czars” to oversee special initiatives with a particular focus on recovery efforts after the 2008 financial crisis. Trump has not continued that

While $22 million in savings is a tiny amount compared to the nearly $20 trillion national debt or the $3.9 trillion federal budget, “it could be a leading indicator of Trump’s commitment to cut waste, fraud and taxpayer abuse,” Andrzejewski said.

“Amid significant uncertainty surrounding the future direction of U.S. health care policy, Premier Health Plan will join several other health insurers in exiting the federal health insurance exchange in Ohio by discontinuing its Premier HealthOne On-Exchange plan at the end of 2017,” the company said.

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, Ohio had 10 insurers operating at the beginning of 2017. Premier Health Plan is the second health insurer to exit, after Anthem announced earlier this month they were leaving the exchanges.

“The uncertainty in Washington, D.C., around the future of the Affordable Care Act—through which the federal exchange was created—and the associated volatility in the marketplace have led us to conclude that we cannot effectively plan and price affordable health insurance to sell on the exchange,” Renee George, president of Premier Health Plan, said in a statement.

U.K. hospitals violated British data privacy laws in a deal with Google’s artificial intelligence company, DeepMind, a privacy watchdog ruled Monday.

After a yearlong investigation, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) said that the Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust, which is composed of three London hospitals, has been asked to restructure its data-sharing practices to comply with the law.

According to the ICO, the hospital group violated the U.K.’s Data Protection Act when it turned over the health information of 1.6 million patients to DeepMind, which is owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet.

“We accept the ICO’s findings and have already made good progress to address the areas where they have concerns,” the Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust said in a statement. “For example, we are now doing much more to keep our patients informed about how their data is used. We would like to reassure patients that their information has been in our control at all times and has never been used for anything other than delivering patient care or ensuring their safety.”

What’s the secret to healthy eating? Less carbs? More fat? Less sugar? Unfortunately, research doesn’t provide clear answers, so it’s wise to be wary of anyone claiming to have a silver bullet. Despite the best of intentions, even if the federal government wanted to improve health through better eating habits, they can’t because they start with bad information.

While they try to associate diets with diseases like obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, they can’t because the dietary information comes from an unreliable source: the people consuming food. Stated simply, no one really knows what Americans are eating because the government’s method for collecting dietary information is to simply ask people what they remember eating in the past.

Memory and recall have long been considered woefully inadequate for scientific data collection. Yet this is what government relies on when providing advice on healthy eating. The government’s main dietary advice is the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA), which was first released in 1980 and is now updated every five years.

The news for the news media keeps getting worse.

A new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll out Monday shows that while the public has low trust in the Trump administration, they trust the media even less.

Just 30 percent of Americans said they have a “great deal” or “good amount” of trust in the news media, the poll shows. That’s lower than the 37 percent of Americans who said the same about the Trump administration. The poll found that 37 percent of adults said they trust the media “not at all,” while another 31 percent said they have “not very much” trust in the news media.

Democrats trust the media far more than either Republicans or independents, the poll shows. While 56 percent of Democrats said they have a “great deal” or “good amount” of trust in the news media, just 28 percent of independents and nine percent of Republicans said the same.

Organizers of Sweden’s largest music festival have canceled the 2018 event after failing to stop sexual assaults.

More than 50,000 people visit the Bråvalla Festival each year. Organizers stepped up their efforts against violence after five rapes and 14 cases of sexual assault were reported in 2016.

With three rapes and 22 sexual assaults reported by the festival’s conclusion Saturday night, the festival’s founder said he can no longer allow the festival to go on.

“I’ve had enough. Violence kills the festival experience, the love for music and, beyond anything else, it hurts people,” Folkert Koopmans, the founder of Bråvalla Festival, said in a press release.

The festival further said the decision should be seen as a clear remark that sexual violence can’t be tolerated.

“It’s not that we can’t handle the problem or that the problem only exists at festivals, it’s about taking a stand,” Kajsa Apelqvist, the festival’s head of communications told Aftonbladet.

Prime Minister Stefan Lofven called for a wider effort to stop sexual assaults at festivals and concerts.

“I get so upset and we need to stop this,” Lofven said Sunday. “We’re demanding police get better at solving these types of crimes. We’re also looking at ways to increase video surveillance.”

British band Mumford & Sons vowed to boycott the festival after being one of the headliners in 2016.

“We won’t play at this festival again until we’ve had assurances from the police and organizers that they’re doing something to combat what appears to be a disgustingly high rate of reported sexual violence,” the band said on its Facebook page after the 2016 festival.

65% of Trump supporters would back a military strike on North Korea, according to a new poll.

The Twitter poll, which received almost 30,000 votes, asked “If Trump launched a military strike on North Korea, would you support it?”

Just 35% of respondents said they would oppose military action.

The numbers that would back a military strike seem significantly higher than those who supported aggression against Syria following April’s cruise missile strike, an event that split Trump’s base.

During a speech in front of the United Nations, Ambassador Nikki Haley warned that sanctions wouldn’t be enough to stop Kim Jong-Un’s dictatorship and that the U.S. was prepared to use “our considerable military forces”.

“Time is short. Action is required. The world is on notice,” she said.

According to the Pentagon, North Korea’s July 4 missile launch was a new type “we have not seen before”.

Most authorities on the issue agree that Pyongyang launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching Alaska, but not the U.S. mainland.

After the launch, North Korea claimed it was, “a full-fledged nuclear power that has been possessed of the most powerful inter-continental ballistic rocket capable of hitting any part of the world”.

San Antonio Police Chief William McManus appeared on “Fox and Friends” Wednesday to discuss anti-police rhetoric after NYPD officer Miosotis Familia was gunned down while sitting in her patrol car.

NBC New York said the shooter was a 34-year-old ex-convict from the Bronx named Alexander Bonds.

The gunman who ambushed and shot an NYPD officer sitting inside her mobile command vehicle Wednesday morning, killing her, was a 34-year-old ex-convict out on parole for robbery, officials say. A motive in the shooting is still not clear, but Alexander Bonds of the Bronx, who also went by the name John Bonds, once ranted online about his treatment in prison and about police getting away with killing people. He had also expressed an anti-government sentiment in online posts, according to a law enforcement official.

San Antonio’s Chief McManus recently dealt with a similar situation to the shooting of Familia when two of his officers were shot at an event he described as “the most unprovoked attack I have ever seen.”

McManus said, “I’m angry at the police haters, I’m sick of the police haters. We protect them. We defend them. And they give us a big F U. And I’m sick of it.”

North Korea test launched Tuesday an intercontinental ballistic missile that may be capable of reaching Alaska.

The projectile, known as the Hwasong-14, was said to have reached an altitude of 2,802 kilometers (1,741 miles) before flying 933 kilometers (579 miles).

The launch is being described by experts as a “game-changer” that further limits the already scant and risky options available to the Trump administration for dealing with Pyongyang.

According to the Korean Central News Agency, North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un described the ICBM as “a gift” to “American bastards.” The news agency also claimed the missile is capable of carrying a “large, heavy nuclear warhead.”

The United Nations Security Council is expected to issue a stern condemnation of the launch after an emergency meeting scheduled Wednesday.

South Korea and the United States responded to the ICBM test by conducting a joint ballistic-missile drill of its own.

The following images were released by North Korean media outlet Rodong Sinmun:

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Evidence emerging from the Vatican in recent days strongly suggests Pope Francis is transforming the Catholic Church into a socialist political organization that embraces the LGBT agenda, in complete rejection of the traditional pro-family religious orientation of his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI.

Last week, Pope Francis fired the Vatican’s top theologian, Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Mueller, the head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, who had a reputation as a staunch defender of the traditional family.

Pope Francis replaced Cardinal Mueller with the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith’s second-in-command, the more liberal Archbishop Luis Francisco Ladaria Ferrer.

Then, on Thursday, July 5, the Daily Mail in London reported Vatican police had broken up a gay orgy occurring in the Vatican-owned apartment belonging to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.

Ironically, this was also the Vatican department Pope Francis had assigned to investigate the Catholic Church’s pedophile sex scandal involving priests in the United States as well as various other countries around the world.

The apartment was apparently the residence of the male secretary to Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio, one of Pope Francis’ key advisors, and the president of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, another key part of the Roman Curia responsible for administering the activities of the Catholic Church worldwide.

Neither development surprised reporter George Neumayr, whose recent book, The Political Pope: How Pope Francis is Delighting the Liberal Left and Abandoning Conservatives, predicted Pope Francis will accelerate the transformation of the Catholic Church into a leftist political organization after former Pope Benedict XVI dies.

“Pope Francis inherited Cardinal Muller from his predecessor and was itching to sack him,” Neumayr explained to Infowars.com in an email.

“Pope Francis was annoyed by Muller’s opposition to the relativism of this pontificate, particularly Muller’s resistance to the pope’s plan to relax the Church’s teaching on adultery,” Neumayr continued.

“Muller also opposed the pope’s policy of distributing Communion to divorced-and-remarried Catholics,” Neumayr added.

Neumayr interpreted the move as Pope Francis distancing himself from the more conservative, traditional papacy of Pope Benedict XVI.

“By dropping Muller, Pope Francis is trying to free himself for once and all from the conservative restraints of Pope Benedict XVI, whose opposition to the ‘dictatorship of relativism’ Pope Francis always disliked,” Neumayr explained.

“Appropriately, Pope Francis has replaced Muller with a fellow Jesuit, the Spanish archbishop Luis Ladaria Ferrer, who appears willing to serve as a rubber stamp for the pope’s liberalism,” Neumayr concluded.

Neumayr also commented on the developing Vatican gay sex orgy scandal.

“This is proof the gay mafia has reached the highest echelons of the Catholic Church,” Neumayr told Infowars.com in an exclusive telephone interview.

“Instead of disbanding the gay mafia, Pope Francis evidently has allowed the gay mafia to burrow deeper into the Vatican.”

Neumayr referenced the decision Pope Francis made in July 2013 to appoint Monsignor Battista Ricca, a veteran Vatican diplomat, to serve as his representative, or “prelate” at the Vatican Bank despite allegations of various gay sexual scandals that plagued Ricca since 1999, when he was sent by the Vatican to Montevideo, Uruguay.

“The ecclesiastical head of the Vatican Bank is still Monsignor Ricca,” Neumayr commented, “and he was entangled in a similar gay sexual scandal before his elevation to his current position.”

Neumayr noted that Pope Francis was aware of the sexual scandal allegations made against Ricca, but Pope Francis decided to disregard the charges when he decided to go ahead and make Ricca head of Vatican Bank anyway.

“No one should be surprised by these episodes — either the firing of Cardinal Mueller or the emerging gay orgy sex scandal,” Neumayr suggested.

“Both are consistent with the direction in which Pope Francis is taking the Catholic Church,” he concluded.

According to New York Magazine and Huffington Post contributing writer Yashar Ali, Secret Service agents interviewed Kathy Griffin for over an hour on Monday to discuss the photo where she posed with Donald Trump’s bloody head in her hand.

News: Kathy Griffin has been interviewed by the Secret Service, in-person, for over an hour….investigation still not closed. — Yashar Ali (@yashar) July 3, 2017

Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) replied by tweeting that the agents could only stomach Griffin for an hour and needed to detox after.

Secret Service interviewed Kathy Griffin for 1 hr; they needed more time, but that's all they could stomach; Agents in de-tox now. — Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) July 5, 2017

Huckabee also referred to CNN as the Corleone News Network in response to their attack on an internet user who made a gif showing Trump body-slamming a man with a CNN logo for a head.

~_~

Cable network CNN identified the man allegedly responsible for creating a meme depicting US President Donald Trump body-slamming the network, an image the president shared on Twitter last week.

After the anonymous Reddit user, “HanAssholeSolo,” issued an apology, CNN graciously said it would not publicly expose the person’s identity if he agreed not to do it again – a move which many saw as blackmail.

In light of CNN’s threat to dox the anonymous Redditor, #CNNBlackmail became a top trend and the Internet naturally responded in kind with more memes depicting CNN being pulverized by President Trump.

Here are a few…

Despite claims President Donald Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton marked a resurgence in the voting power of Christians in America, a globalist publication is claiming the last election was “the death rattle of White Christian America.”

“Does Trump’s victory, then, represent the resurrection of White Christian America? The consequences of the 2016 elections are indeed sweeping,” wrote Robert Jones in an excerpt from his book “The End of White Christian America” reposted in The Atlantic.



“Republicans entered 2017 with control of both houses of Congress and the White House, and because the Republican-controlled Senate refused to consider an Obama appointee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in early 2016, Trump was able to nominate a conservative Supreme Court justice right out of the gate.”

“The evidence, however, suggests that Trump’s unlikely victory is better understood as the death rattle of White Christian America — the cultural and political edifice built primarily by white Protestant Christians — rather than as its resuscitation.”

While white evangelical Christians represented 21% of the general population at the time of the 2008 election, they comprised 26% of actual voters. In 2016, despite a decline in their proportion of the population to 17%, white evangelicals continued to represent 26% of voters – clear evidence President Trump’s warnings about the dire attacks on religious liberty resonated with evangelical voters.

“Despite the outcome of the 2016 elections, the key long-term trends indicate White Christian America’s decline is continuing unabated,” Jones suggested. “Over the last eight years, the percentage of Americans who identify as white and Christian fell 11 percentage points, and support for same-sex marriage jumped 18 percentage points.”

The campaign between Clinton and Trump presented voters two starkly contrasting views of America’s future, he added.

“Donald Trump’s campaign painted a bleak portrait of America’s present, set against a bright, if monochromatic, vision of 1950s America restored. Hillary Clinton’ campaign, by contrast, sought to replace the first African American president with the first female president and embraced the multicultural future of 2050, the year the Census Bureau originally projected the United States would become a majority nonwhite nation,” Jones claimed.

Jones, the chief executive of the Public Religion Research Institute, first made his opinions about the decline of white Christian America known in an op-ed written in the immediate aftermath of Trump’s victory.

“The waning numbers of white Christians in the country today may not have time on their side, but as the sun is slowly setting on the cultural world of white Christian America, they’ve managed, at least in this election, to rage against the dying of the light,” he wrote in The New York Times.

CNN Senior Political Analyst Ronald Brownstein recently argued both political parties represent “virtually mirror image Americas with very little overlap,” with the Democratic Party representing a coalition of voters that is “racially diverse, younger, more secular, overwhelmingly urbanized, and more rooted in the globalized, post-industrial and low-carbon economy.”

“That jagged contrast between what I have called the Democrats’ ‘Coalition of Transformation,’ which largely welcomes those changes, and the Republican ‘Coalition of Restoration,’ which largely feels unsettled or eclipsed by them, has become arguably the central fault line in American life.”

CNN host Alisyn Camerota could not contain her excitement at the fact that her network had tracked down the Reddit user who created the Trump wrestling meme, and that he has issued an apology, despite the fact that CNN is being accused of using sinister blackmail tactics, threatening to publicly identify the person.

“I thought it was remarkable that CNN found the Reddit user who created the GIF,” a clearly enthusiastic Camerota told viewers.

The anchor read out a statement of apology from the meme creator (pictured below).





“…the investigative team went back and found the guy who first created this,” she noted, adding “How often do you hear someone who creates a video, goes viral, and apologizes.”

“The reason that I think this is so notable … This is a very, full-throated, genuine honest apology,” Camerota said. “He has also asked that we not reveal his name or whereabouts, and we at CNN are honoring that because he’s apologized, and he thinks that he would then be in danger and at risk if other people knew his name. We get it. We understand that.”

Reporter Chris Cillizza said that it was a very “nice thing” that CNN “tracked him down,” while CNN host Chris Cuomo stated that the individual apologized after he was “exposed and identified.”

However, Cuomo’s assertions run in contradiction to the claims of CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski, who is accused of carrying out the blackmailing.

Kaczynski claims that the user posted an apology before he was contacted.

https://twitter.com/KFILE/status/882418323673239553

Kaczynski also claims that the ‘threat’ CNN made to dox the individual is being ‘misinterpreted’.

https://twitter.com/KFILE/status/882438606270410752

https://twitter.com/KFILE/status/882417992717537280

CNN’s Chris Cuomo also took to Twitter to slam the individual for being a ‘ faceless hater’:

is being faceless getting old? own your words with an identity. truth, faceless hater, is not about telling you what you want to hear https://t.co/VKyFkQ7eJo — Christopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) July 5, 2017

Cuomo was quickly reminded that most of CNN’s hit pieces on the President have relied on ‘anonymous sources’:

CNN reporters now going after anonymity CNN has relied on anon sources for dozens of nonsense Trump/Russia stories, incl retracted stories https://t.co/oHvWbLKhmB — Omri Ceren (@omriceren) July 5, 2017

only a fool thinks unnamed sources suggest a lack of reliability. cornerstone of good journalism. many lawmakers often ask for this https://t.co/eRXQlK7zvH — Christopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) July 5, 2017

When Americans responded to Cuomo by saying CNN’s ratings were collapsing, the reporter just dug in deeper:

collapse? where do you get this bs? cnn mornings are way up. so is joe. covering trump matters to people. #GetWoke https://t.co/SqN53I3ZRP — Christopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) July 5, 2017

The culprit behind a shocking “unprovoked attack” on a female police officer had spouted anti-cop rhetoric in the past and urged people to vote for Hillary Clinton.

Authorities are trying to piece together a motive after NYPD officer and mother of three Miosotis Familia was brutally gunned down in cold blood by Alexander Bonds early Monday morning while she sat in a temporary headquarters vehicle at East 183rd Street and Morris Avenue in Fordham Heights.

Bonds was subsequently killed by two other officers called to the scene while Familia died in hospital.

“This is absolutely an unprovoked attack,” said NYPD Commissioner James P. O’Neill. Police say surveillance footage shows Bonds pulling up his hoodie before “purposefully” walking up to the vehicle and shooting through the passenger side.

Speculation as to why 34-year-old Bonds, who had previously served seven years in prison for a Syracuse robbery, gunned down Familia has begun to center on his political beliefs.

Bonds’ Facebook page reveals that days before the presidential election, he posted a video of a woman alleging that voting machines were switching Hillary Clinton votes to Donald Trump.

“Watch out also go vote our voices matter believe that if I could I kno u would,” he wrote.

On the same day he urged people to “get mad” about the election and vote. When asked who he was voting for, Bonds responded that he couldn’t vote (due to his felony conviction), but said people should vote for Hillary Clinton.

According to the New York Daily News, Bonds, “Spoke critically of law enforcement on an unspecified social media site.”

The video below features Bonds engaged in a foul-mouthed rant against the police.

Man who murdered NYPD officer Miosotis Familia posted anti-police video on Facebook. pic.twitter.com/bqTP18XFOu — Josh Caplan (@joshdcaplan) July 5, 2017

Bonds also posted Malcolm X memes as well as videos of confrontations between black people and police officers.

Previous ambush-style murders of police officers have been motivated by extremist anti-cop ‘Black Lives Matter’-style rhetoric, as well as mass shootings of police officers like the Dallas massacre, which was celebrated by BLM sympathizers.

There has been no word yet from prominent ‘Black Lives Matter’ personalities about the killing of Miosotis Familia.

CNN’s terrifying decision to threaten to personally destroy HanAssholeSolo, the person who created the epic WWE video President Trump tweeted out last week, CNN’s chilling move to go the full-Brownshirt against some nobody goofing on the Internet, does not surprise me at all.

What is a little shocking is how open the leftwing network was about its mafia tactics. A threat, an actual threat, a warning to others, right there in print! On CNN! [emphasis added]

CNN, a multi-billion dollar, mega-media corporation will be watching the behavior of a private citizen (all of us, really) and should this person (all of us, really) ever be discovered behaving in a way that this multi-billion dollar, mega-media corporation disapproves, this multi-billion dollar, mega-corporation will ruin this person’s life (all of our lives, really) — will reveal YOUR name, will see to it that you lose your job, are harassed out of your home, and whatever other horrors CNN’s fascist SJW Army can come up with.

Newly released data from the NHS shows there were more than 5,000 new cases of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) recorded over the last year, with 120 cases involving women and girls that were born in the UK.

The practice is banned in the UK, however, many families take young girls out of the country in order to undergo the barbaric procedure. Since 1985 when it became illegal in the UK, not a single parent has been prosecuted.

Data suggests those most at risk are girls from Egypt, Gambia, Kenya and Nigeria. Around a third of all cases involves girls from Somalia.

CNN is reeling from a huge backlash after the news organization was accused of blackmailing the creator of the infamous Trump-CNN wrestling meme by threatening to reveal his identity.

The mainstream media thought it had scored a victory when it was discovered that the original creator of the meme had previously posted racist content.

However, the individual, know by his handle ‘HanAssholeSolo’, has if anything been turned into a martyr.

The controversy erupted when CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski bragged that CNN had refrained from publishing HanAssholeSolo’s real name because he had “issued an extensive statement of apology,” showed remorse and promised not to make fun of CNN again.

“CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change,” stated the article.

This led to a firestorm of fury, with even many on the left slamming CNN for its unethical, and possibly illegal, practice.

Kaczynski then attempted to claim that HanAssholeSolo had apologized before CNN contacted him, contradicting his previous tweet which stated that HanAssholeSolo’s apology “came after CNN identified and reached out to him.”

The reaction on Twitter was vitriolic as #CNNBlackmail began trending.

Wikileaks’ Julian Assange posted a number of tweets in which he documented how CNN had broken the law, as well as tweeting, “A multi-billion dollar TV network blackmailing a private citizen into not making funny videos about it is not journalism, CNN.”

CNN essentially blackmailed a private citizen because he made fun of CNN.

Let that sink in.

Should a news organization that blackmails private citizens be allowed to have White House press access?

Fresh off the back of James O’Keefe’s CNN exposé , the news network is on the ropes. It’s difficult to see how they’re going to recover from this one without huge damage to their credibility.

It also remains to be seen whether the originator of the meme, who some claim could be as young as 15-years-old (although Kaczynski denies this), will seek to launch a lawsuit against CNN.

Leftist media figures questioned whether or not President Trump was threatening them after he tweeted on Monday that “at some point” the news “will be forced to discuss our great job numbers” and “strong economy.”

From Breitbart:

Trump tweeted: “At some point the Fake News will be forced to discuss our great jobs numbers, strong economy, success with ISIS, the border & so much else!”

At some point the Fake News will be forced to discuss our great jobs numbers, strong economy, success with ISIS, the border & so much else! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2017

NBC’s Katy Tur oh-so-seriously and ominously asked on-air what Trump meant by “forced.” Talking Points Memo asked, “Trump declares the press will be “forced” to cover his achievements. What First Amendment?”

A contributor to the New York Times and New Republic wrote, “Interesting choice by Trump to use the word ‘forced’ the day after sharing his fantasy of assaulting a news network.” An NBC News editor emphasized Trump’s use of the words “will be ‘forced’ to.”

Later in the day, though he did not specifically mention or refer to the tweet, NBC’s Chuck Todd spoke generally about Trump’s “dehumanizing” tweets.

“If these actions and this language was being used by a leader in a different country, our State Department… not just we in general… would be saying ‘Hmm, that country is inching towards authoritarianism,'” Todd said. “Because that’s usually the first sign: when you try to delegitimize a free press.”

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un promised more small and big “gift packages” for “the US imperialists” while he was pleased to observe the first successful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test, according to the North’s official state media.

Lauding the DPRK’s scientists and pleased with the fact that Tuesday’s successful launch coincided with Independence Day in the US, Kim Jong-un called to “frequently send big and small ‘gift packages’ to the Yankees as ever so that they will not feel weary,” the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said, as cited by KCNA Watch on Wednesday.

The report added that Kim was “feasting his eyes” on the latest addition to the North’s arsenal before the test, calling it the final phase of “the protracted showdown with the US imperialists,” which can “demonstrate its mettle to the US which is testing its will in defiance of its warning.”

On Tuesday morning, Pyongyang claimed it had successfully launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile, Hwasong-14, which is capable of carrying a “large, heavy nuclear warhead.” The missile, which can reportedly strike the US mainland, was called “another brilliant victory of the Korean people in their struggle against the US-led imperialists.”

“The test-launch confirmed the features of the rocket’s blast-off from its launching pad and technological features of its guidance and stability system in its active-flight stages and structural system,” KCNA reported.

After the launch, Pyongyang said its Hwasong-14 ICBM flew some 933km in 39 minutes, reaching an altitude of 2,802km, according to state television.

However, there are different estimates of the range of the latest missile. The US military initially said the rocket was a land-based intermediate-range ballistic missile, which fell into the Sea of Japan (known in Korea as the East Sea) after covering more than 930km in 37 minutes.

Later in the day Washington changed its assessment, saying that Pyongyang’s rocket had a two-stage design which would allow the projectile to fly the range required to be classed as an ICBM.

Meanwhile the South Korean military confirmed that its northern neighbor tested a new ICBM, according to Yonhap.

On Tuesday, the Russian Defense Ministry stated that North Korea launched an intermediate range missile (IRBM), which flew some 535 kilometers, reaching an altitude of 510km, and fell into the Sea of Japan, according to its data.

The type of the missile determines the distance it can cover and thus whether it would be able to reach and strike the United States, which is treated as one of the top threats to North Korean security and vice versa. ICBMs can cover a distance of more than of 5,500km and can potentially hit the US, while IRBMs have a much shorter range and pose no threat.

The test launch triggered the world’s reaction, from world leaders’ statements to joint drills. On Tuesday, Moscow and Beijing called on North Korea to freeze its nuclear and missile programs, and at the same time urged the US and South Korea to abstain from holding war games in the region.

Despite the warnings, the US and South Korean militaries launched surface-to-surface tactical missiles into neutral waters, with the American side threatening to deploy and engage missile systems in case of further provocation from the North.

However, Pyongyang is apparently not planning to stop its nuclear and missile tests as long as Washington follows a “hostile policy” towards Pyongyang and poses a “nuclear threat.”

“The DPRK would neither put its nukes and ballistic rockets on the table of negotiations in any case nor flinch even an inch from the road of bolstering the nuclear force chosen by itself unless the US hostile policy and nuclear threat to the DPRK are definitely terminated,” state media KCNA said.

Over the past 20 years, European cities have slowly become more ethnically diverse, as EU governments open their borders to foreign populations.

And as this process has taken place, the authorities have been quick to cover up any crimes that have been committed by these populations. For instance, Swedish police are no longer allowed to describe the ethnic background of the criminals they catch, and most notably, the German government and press were desperate to cover up hundreds sexual assaults that occurred in Cologne in 2015.

However, there are certain statistics that can’t be covered up. A government can try to conceal the connection between crimes and specific ethnic groups, but they can’t cover up the overall crime statistics of an entire city. Plus, politically correct governments can’t really hide the ethnic diversity of their cities. That’s something that their progressive sensibilities command them to promote.

Fortunately, sometimes those two factors come together to give us all a good look at the relationship between immigration and crime in Europe, despite the best efforts of European governments to conceal that connection. For example, the German government recently revealed that more than half of the population of Frankfurt has a foreign background, arguably making it the most diverse major city in Germany.

For the first time, more than half of Frankfurt residents now have a migrant background, according to official data from the city’s Office of Statistics and Elections. Presenting the figures, which show that 51.2 per cent of people living in Frankfurt have a migrant background, the city’s secretary of integration Sylvia Weber said: “We have minorities with relatively large numbers in Frankfurt but no group with a clear majority.” Representing 13 per cent of the population, Turks are the city’s largest non-German minority, and 61 per cent of residents who were born abroad are citizens of other European Union (EU) countries.

And on top of that, the data reveals that these people aren’t thriving in Germany. 49% of people with foreign backgrounds in Frankfurt live below the poverty line, compared to 23% of native Germans, and they are significantly more likely to be unemployed. But that’s not the real kicker. Frankfurt was a diverse city long before the migrant crisis reached its peak, and even then it had a startling crime rate.

The 2013 national crime figures, which were leaked to Welt newspaper earlier this week, show just under six million crimes were recorded in Germany last year. When broken down to the number of crimes per 100,000 inhabitants, Frankfurt am Main rates as the most dangerous city in Germany with 16,292 crimes per 100,000 people. Its high ranking was put down to its red light district and the large airport.

Of course if you brought this fact up to most leftists, they would call you a racist. But it has nothing to do with race. The real problem is that Germany hasn’t properly vetted their immigrants, nor have they successfully assimilated them. Germany is inviting people into their country who have no respect for German law, and they aren’t pressuring them to join German culture. And the result is rather predictable. Germany has a large foreign population that is young, jobless, alienated from mainstream culture, and more likely to commit crimes.

What we’re seeing in Frankfurt is the future of Europe, if EU nations continue to celebrate multiculturalism and leave their borders wide open. It will be a divided continent, filled with ethnic enclaves, no-go zones, civil unrest, and crime. If they don’t see the folly of multiculturalism, within a generation every city in Europe will be like Frankfurt, or perhaps even worse.

French president Emmanuel Macron has declared he will govern France like Jupiter, the Roman king of the gods, shortly after officials told the media his thought process was “too complex” for journalists to understand.

Summoning over 900 politicians from both houses of the French parliament to a rare Congress at the palace of Louis XIV – the ‘Sun King’ – in Versailles, he threatened to overrule lawmakers with a referendum if they try to frustrate the “reforms” he wishes to impose on the legislature. Such assemblies are usually reserved for times of national crisis.

Reuters reports him as saying he desires to reign as a “Jupiterian” president – “a remote, dignified figure, like the Roman god of gods, who weighs his rare pronouncements carefully”.

Amid North Korea’s repeated missile launches, evacuation drills conducted with the participation of local residents and based on the scenario that a missile strike is imminent are being held in many places across the nation.

Such drills have already been conducted in nine prefectures, and there are more scheduled to be carried out in at least 11 prefectures.

This month, the nation’s first drill in which people will evacuate to an underground mall is scheduled to occur in Takaoka, Toyama Prefecture.

People who might face such an emergency are required to evacuate in a different way than in the event of an earthquake.

Infowars Life Survival Shield X-2 Is Now Available



Leading the way into the next generation of super high quality nascent iodine, the new Infowars Life Survival Shield X-2 is now here.



New Stronger Formula From 7,000 Feet Below The Surface



Derived from 200 million year old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface, the next level of Survival Shield is now here and much stronger than our original formula with a powerful 650 micrograms per single drop.



Experience the benefits of next level proprietary nascent iodine, developed using our Thermodynamic Pressure Sensitive High Energy Sound Pulse Nano-Emulsion Technology that allows for a highly unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives and genetically modified ingredients. We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X-2 iodine for radiation during our quality control phase.



The Top 5 Reasons You Need Nascent Iodine



Iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health and well-being.

Nascent iodine may support healthy iodine levels.

Nascent iodine may support healthy hormone levels.

Nascent iodine may be involved in maintaining healthy metabolism. Supplementing with pure nascent iodine may provide sufficient iodine so that the body does not need to absorb iodine from other, perhaps less pure, sources.



Survival Shield X-2 Quality



Survival Shield X-2 is manufactured in a state-licensed facility that meets federal regulatory standards, is cGMP/HACCP-compliant, and lab grade. Raw elemental iodine is a controlled substance both at a State and Federal level. The licensing, approvals and regulatory documentary procedures are exacting and costly.



Bound forms of iodine must first be separated, clarified and purified from other binding components or impurities into a USP-grade (United States Pharmaceutical), mono-elemental iodine as certified USP resublimated iodine crystals. In this purified crystal form, iodine is a highly reactive and toxic substance. However, when the purified USP iodine crystals are subjected to a proprietary process it becomes nano-colloidalized and transforms into a form of elemental nascent iodine, also referred to as monoatomic iodine, without the addition of iodides!



Shocking Statistics About Iodine



According to the World Health Organization's Department o f Nutrition for Health and Development, iodine deficiency is a public health problem in 54 countries.

The CDC states that iodine deficiency is one of the four major deficiency diseases in the world (Fortunately, it is the easiest to correct).

The 2013 USGS iodine commodity summary warns that there are no comparable substitutes for iodine.

Information published by UNICEF notes that iodine deficiency is the most avoidable cause of stunted physical and intellectual development.

What Are The Health Benefits Of Nascent Iodine?



Proper iodine levels may provide support for normal response to environmental and dietary toxins.

Supports thyroid health.

May support breast milk production and quality.

Why Is Survival Shield X-2 The Best Nascent Iodine Available?



Survival Shield X-2 is created from salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.



It is tested for radiation by our quality control experts before being placed for sale.



It is approximately 50% stronger than our original Survival Shield formulation.



It is a true glycerite of natural USP grade iodine

The nascen t iodine in Survival Shield X-2 is not subjected to direct heat, harsh chemicals, or alcohol.

The transformative process produces a stable product that no other brand can match!

Completely non-GMO certified.

Vegan-friendly and completely non-toxic.

It provides high elemental iodine uptake.

Contains NO inefficient iodides.

Does not sting or burn.

Bill Gates has blasted Germany’s open-door migrant policy warning European leaders they must make it more difficult for North Africans to reach the continent.

The Microsoft founder and world’s richest person said Europe will not be able to handle the huge numbers of people desperately trying to leave Africa.

This comes as Austrian tanks have moved to seal off a vital border with Italy as over 84,000 migrants from North African have reached Italian shores this year – a 19 per cent increase from last year according to the UN.

Spain is also struggling to cope with the crisis with 6,000 people arriving by boat this year and dozens drowning during the treacherous journey.

Speaking with German news outlet Welt am Sonntag newspaper, US billionaire Gates, 61, said developed nations should instead be spending more on foreign aid to treat the causes of migration.

He said: “On the one hand you want to demonstrate generosity and take in refugees.

“But the more generous you are, the more word gets around about this — which in turn motivates more people to leave Africa.

“Germany cannot possibly take in the huge number of people who are wanting to make their way to Europe.”

While the world watches in jest as Japanese residents prepare for the possibility of a confrontation with North Korea by panic buying nuclear shelters and air purifiers, we may soon realize that their efforts to desperately acquire protective gear and equipment for nuclear disaster were quite prescient.

Yesterday, North Korea successfully tested what is reportedly an ICBM (Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile) capable of striking Alaska from the Korean peninsula. Coupled with their purported advancements in nuclear technology, North Korea may now have the ability to launch devastating attacks on their southern neighbor, Japan and even the United States. And if they have not yet achieved the ability to fit a nuclear warhead on an ICBM and deliver it effectively to its target, they are inching closer by the day.

So close, in fact, that Chinese Ambassador Liu Jieyi’s recent remarks on the matter suggest that we are nearing a dangerous breaking point:

“Currently tensions are high and we certainly would like to see a de-escalation,” Liu told a news conference at UN headquarters as China takes over the Security Council presidency in July. “If tension only goes up … then sooner or later it will get out of control and the consequences would be disastrous,” he said.

Earlier this year President Trump deployed three carrier strike groups to the region, signaling the real possibility that the United States will no longer follow what Secretary of State Rex Tillerson calls a policy of “strategic patience” employed by Trump’s predecessors.

Though the threat seems to be muted by global media, China and Russia appear to be taking it very seriously, with both having reportedly deployed tens of thousands of troops and equipment to their respective borders with the North.

All of the signs suggest that military action is about to occur. And while most Americans may think that North Korea would be another Iraq, wherein the battle could be won in a matter days, the fact is that North Korea has a massive military and now, as confirmed yesterday, an ICBM capable of striking long-range targets.

Now may be a good time to imitate the Japanese by preparing for the worst, because the moment the world realizes that war is imminent there will be a run on banks and grocery stores that will likely leave shelves and ATM machines completely empty. Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the price of government recommended anti-radiation pills skyrocketed from $15 to over $200 per unit. We expect to see a similar effect in coming weeks and months for preparedness equipment like gas masks and NBC body suits as tensions on the Peninsula heat up.

War is coming. President Trump has made this very clear and North Korea does not appear to be heeding his warning. All bets will be off once the missiles start flying.

Because all three of the world’s major super powers will be involved in one way or another it is not only possible, but quite likely that things could spiral out of control very quickly.

A female New York City police officer has died after being shot in the Bronx early Wednesday in what police described as an “unprovoked attack.”

Police rushed to the scene in Fordham in the area of 183rd Street and Morris Avenue around 12:30 a.m. The officer, identified as 48-year-old Miosotis Familia, was sitting in a marked NYPD command vehicle with her partner when she was shot, Commissioner James P. O’Neill said at a Wednesday morning press conference.

O’Neill said the suspect fired through the window of the car, striking the officer in the head. Her partner immediately radioed in for assistance.

“We are conducting an extensive search for video at this time,” O’Neill said at the press conference. “Based off what we know right now, it’s clear this was an unprovoked attack on a police officer who are assigned to keep the people of this great city safe.”

NPR faced accusations of political bias Tuesday for marking the Fourth of July by tweeting out the entire Declaration of Independence.

NPR has celebrated Independence Day for 29 years by having hosts, reporters and commentators read the Declaration of Independence on-air.

But a number of Twitter users slammed NPR for tweeting it this year, interpreting the outlet’s sharing of the founding U.S. document as a call “for revolution” and a way to “condone the violence.”

While some users ripped NPR, others mocked those who disapproved:

Migrants from Central American countries are increasingly choosing to resettle in Mexico as the Trump administration’s tough immigration enforcement policies make the U.S. a less accessible destination.

For years, Mexico has largely been a waypoint for people from the so-called Northern Triangle countries — Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador — who were trying to cross into the U.S. and petition for asylum. As the U.S. has cracked down on illegal immigration at the border and tightened its rules on accepting asylum claims, those migrants are now staying put in Mexico.

As a result, Mexico’s refugee applications have risen dramatically over the last three years, reports the Associated Press. It received 3,424 applications for refugee status in 2015, and the number more than doubled to 8,794 the next year. Mexico is on track to receive even more refugee applications in 2017 — there were 5,464 applications from just January to May.

Migration experts say word of tougher immigration and asylum policies in the U.S. has made its way back to Central America, causing migrants to choose Mexico or other neighboring countries instead. Maureen Meyer, a senior associate for Mexico at the Washington Office on Latin America, says potential immigrants now realize that Mexico is a safer bet for asylum claims.

“If you look at Mexico’s definition of who can qualify for asylum, it’s much broader than the United States,” Meyer told the AP. “If you are fleeing widespread violence in your country, you may be able to qualify for asylum in Mexico, whereas in the U.S. you have to prove that you belong to very specific groups of people.”

Mexico granted refugee status to about one of every three applicants from the Northern Triangle in 2016, reports the AP. The U.S., on the other hand, denies about 80 percent of asylum claims by people from those countries, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.

Under the Obama administration, migration from the Northern Triangle to the U.S. reached unprecedented levels. In 2013, as many as 2.7 million people born in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras were living in the United States, according to a report from the Council on Foreign Relations. That was up from an estimated 1.5 million people in 2000.

Between October 2013 and July 2015, more 100,000 unaccompanied minors from the Northern Triangle arrived in the U.S. and were given expedited resettlement under an emergency Obama order to deal with the surge.

The Trump administration has taken a much less permissive stance, pressuring Mexico to accept more Central American immigrants while publicly discouraging people from making the trek northward.

“We have asked them [Northern Triangle countries] to ask their citizens to not waste the money and head north, do not get on that terribly dangerous network,” Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly told the Senate in June. “Stay where they are, because if they come here, this is no longer an illegal-alien-friendly environment.”

An “astonishing” rise in harmful Christian exorcisms is being partly driven by migrant communities, a think tank has warned.

A report by Theos, a think tank focusing on religion, found that experts were concerned that the “booming industry” in exorcisms was putting Christians’ mental health at risk.

The report, which examines the relationship between Christianity and mental health, said: “Exorcisms are now a booming industry in the UK, with a number of interviewees noting the astonishing increase in demand – often, as one noted, in defiance of any actual rules or procedures put in place by any church.”

It said that this industry was in part “driven by immigrant communities and Pentecostal churches which are very open about their exorcism services”.

Parents in France will be legally obliged to vaccinate their children from 2018, the government has announced.

French Prime Minister Édouard Philippe said it was “unacceptable” that children are “still dying of measles” in the country where some of the earliest vaccines were pioneered.

Three childhood vaccines, for diphtheria, tetanus and polio, are currently mandatory in France. Others, including those against hepatitis and whooping cough, are simply recommended.

Announcing the policy, Mr Philippe evoked the name of Louis Pasteur, the French biologist who made breakthroughs in disease research and developed the first vaccines for rabies and anthrax in the 19th century.

An Obamacare program awarded hospitals thousands of dollars in bonuses even if they had low-quality scores, according to a reportfrom the Government Accountability Office.

The Hospital Value-Based Purchasing program, which was created by Obamacare, was designed to incentivize participating hospitals to increase efficiency and quality.

Even though the program’s purpose is to reward hospitals that offer high-quality care at a lower cost, the auditors found that hospitals with low quality scores but high efficiency scores still received bonuses.

In fiscal year 2017, there were 345 hospitals that received a bonus with quality scores below the median. Roughly 20 percent of hospitals that received a bonus had a quality score below the median from 2015 through 2017.

The of numbers of individuals in different states on food stamps have dropped precipitously after certain counties in different states decided to re-establish work requirements for food stamp government benefits that ballooned under the Obama administration, Fox News reported Tuesday.

A 2009 congressional economic stimulus package did away with previous work requirements in the states for able-bodied adults and the rolls of those on food stamps spiked to 48 million people across the country by 2013. Preliminary figures for Fiscal Year 2017 show that the number of recipients on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is in a downward trend.

Other ways are being explored to cut the number of SNAP recipients.

After re-instituting the work requirement in 21 more counties in Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported a 62 percent drop in SNAP participants.

Nasdaq has issued a market-wide trading halt amid what appears to be a “glitch” that sent a number of the largest Nasdaq-listed stocks to crash or spike to exactly $123.47 per share.

This move crashed the value of companies including Amazon and Apple, sparked chaos in Microsoft, while sending Zynga rocketing up more than 3000%.

On the eve of the US Independence Day holiday and in after-hours trading, The FT reports that market data show that companies such as Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, eBay and Zynga were repriced at $123.47.

The Bloomberg data terminal listed either “market wide circuit breaker halt — level 2” or “volatility trading pause” on all the stocks affected.



The glitch did not affect any market trading, including after hours.

The mysterious reset to $123.47 per share meant that Amazon in theory saw its share price marked down 87.2 per cent…

while shares in Apple fell 14.3 per cent…

But Nasdaq-listed Microsoft had jumped 79.1 per cent — which would value the company at nearly $1tn…

As Bloomberg reports, the apparent swings triggered trading halts in some securities, according to automatically generated messages. The halts are a mechanism exchanges use to limit the impact of particularly volatile sessions. A system status alert on Nasdaq’s website said that systems were operating normally at 8:23 p.m. ET. After-market hours on Nasdaq typically last from 4 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.

In a statement, Nasdaq said the glitch was related to “improper use of test data” sent out to third party data providers, and said it was working to “ensure a prompt resolution of this matter”. In cases of any clearly erroneous data, trades made are cancelled.

As a reminder this is not the first time ‘glitches’ have occurred on holidays… remember gold on Thanksgiving 2014.

An angry Italy summoned Austria’s ambassador after the government in Vienna announced it was ready to re-introduce border controls and deploy troops and armored vehicles along the border to block any migrant influx out of Italy. Austrian Defence Minister Hans Peter Doskozil told Kronen Zeitung daily that troops could go to the Brenner Pass and that four Pandur armoured personnel carriers had been sent to the Tyrol region with 750 troops were on standby.

“We need to prepare for the migration development in Italy, and I expect very promptly that border controls will have to be activated and assistance requested,” Hans Peter Doskozil told the online edition of the Krone daily, adding that a military deployment at the busy Alpine pass would be “indispensable if the influx into Italy [across the Mediterranean] does not diminish”. While Austria has border checks with Hungary and Slovenia, elsewhere – such as on the border with Italy – it adheres to the EU open borders system.

Doskozil explained that “these are not battle tanks. These are armored vehicles without weapons which could block roads. These were already used during the refugee crisis 201/16 at the Spielfeld border crossing [with Slovenia],” just in case Italy got the impression that its northern neighbor was preparing to invade.

The border controls will include the Alpine Brenner pass, which forms the border between Austria and Italy, one of the main mountain passes in the eastern Alps. There isn’t a strict time plan for the step-up in border security, but, according to Doskozil’s spokesman, “we see how the situation in Italy is becoming more acute and we have to be prepared to avoid a situation comparable to summer 2015” according to Reuters.

Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz said that Vienna is prepared to “protect” the frontier with Italy “if necessary,” as he spoke with the Austria Press Agency. Later Italy’s foreign ministry said it had summoned Austrian Ambassador Rene Pollitzer “following the Austrian government’s statement about deploying troops to the Brenner (pass)”.

The latest turmoil inside Europe’s customs union comes two years after Germany admitted over a million mostly Syrian migrants, as part of Angela Merkel’s “Open Door” (since shut) welcome, and just days after Italy’s interior minister demanded other EU nations “step up” and relieve Italy of the sudden flood of inbound migrants.

The Italian governor of South Tyrol, Arno Kompatscher, sought to defuse tensions. According to BBC, he said Austria had issued similar warnings about the border previously, and the situation there remained “quiet and stable”. Austria was gearing up for a general election in October, Mr Kompatscher noted. The anti-immigration Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) is expected to poll strongly.

People-smuggling gangs have been exploiting the violence and chaos in Libya. The shortest crossing from Libya to Italy is only about 460km (290 miles). Nearly 85,000 migrants and refugees arrived in Italy in the first half of this year, across the Mediterranean. The UN refugee agency UNHCR says that is about 20% more than in the first half of 2016.

To be sure, the UN joined Italy’s appeal, with Vincent Cochetel, the UNHCR’S special envoy for the central Mediterranean, saying that “this is not sustainable. We need to have other countries joining Italy and sharing that responsibility.” So far, nobody in the European “Union” has stepped up to “share the responsibility” of Europe’s generous refugee acceptance program.

The latest report by the UNHCR, revealed another troubling statistics: few of the migrants coming to Europe will granted asylum: 30% of them are fleeing conflict or persecution, while 70% of those arriving in Italy are economic migrants. Most migrants and refugees are young, single men with little or no education, and almost 15% are unaccompanied minors.

Meanwhile, Italy has also warned that the current scale of migrant arrivals is unsustainable and that it could even close its ports and impound aid agencies’ rescue ships. In other words, yet another refugee crisis in Europe is imminent.

It will be the second time this has happened in two years. In 2015, the EU’s Schengen system, or the free movement across most European borders, was overwhelmed by an influx of migrants and refugees, whoe reached Central Europe via the Balkans, and most sought asylum in Germany. Since then, tighter border controls in the Balkans have reduced the numbers heading north from Greece. Most of the influx to Austria was via Hungary. Many of those who came by train or on foot were refugees from Syria, Iraq and other conflict zones.

So far 101,000 migrants have entered Europe in 2017 via the Mediterranean and according to the latest figures, 2,247 people have died or are missing at sea.

EU antitrust regulators are weighing another record fine against Google over its Android mobile operating system and have set up a panel of experts to give a second opinion on the case, two people familiar with the matter said.

Assuming the panel agrees with the initial case team’s conclusions, it could pave the way for the European Commission to issue a decision against Alphabet’s (GOOGL.O) Google by the end of the year.

The Commission in April last year charged Google with using its dominant Android mobile operating system to shut out rivals following a complaint by lobby group FairSearch, U.S.-based ad-blocking and privacy firm Disconnect Inc, Portuguese apps store Aptoide and Russia’s Yandex (YNDX.O).

The move by the EU competition authority, which hit the company with a 2.4 billion euro ($2.7 billion) penalty for unfairly favoring its shopping service last month, could pose a bigger risk for the world’s most popular internet search engine because of Android’s huge growth potential.

In the coming days, Iraqi counterterrorism forces are expected to assault the remaining ISIS stronghold in Tal Afar—roughly 40 miles west of Mosul—according to the commander of Iraq’s Joint Military Operations, Lieutenant General Abdel Amir Rashid Yarallah, who spoke to Iraqi media July 4.

“Tal Afar is the next point of liberation with the participation of all military units,” Yarallah said.

“The Turkmen-dominated city of Tal Afar is completely encircled by Turkmen Shia militia and Peshmerga forces,” the leader of the 10,000-man Turkmen Shia Popular Mobilization Forces told Free Beacon Sunday. Abu Retha al Najjar, who directs 2,500 fighters engaged in Tal Afar said that the Tal Afar has approximately 900 ISIS fighters left, of which 650 are local and 250 are foreign fighters. “The district of Tal Afar once held 350,000 Turkmen residents, including Shia and Sunni families, but only 30,000 civilians still live there, chiefly in the town of Maria,” Najjar said.

“Whether the next fight against ISIS is in Tal Afar, Al-Hawija, or Al-Qaim, the coalition will continue to support our Iraqi partners to defeat our common enemy,” said Col. Ryan Dillon, spokesman for the Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR), speaking to defense reporters Thursday.

An angry Italy summoned Austria's ambassador after the government in Vienna announced it was ready to re-introduce border controls and deploy troops and armored vehicles along the border to block any migrant influx out of Italy. Austrian Defence Minister Hans Peter Doskozil told Kronen Zeitung daily that troops could go to the Brenner Pass and that four Pandur armoured personnel carriers had been sent to the Tyrol region with 750 troops were on standby.

“We need to prepare for the migration development in Italy, and I expect very promptly that border controls will have to be activated and assistance requested,” Hans Peter Doskozil told the online edition of the Krone daily, adding that a military deployment at the busy Alpine pass would be "indispensable if the influx into Italy [across the Mediterranean] does not diminish".

BRUSSELS EU antitrust regulators are weighing another record fine against Google over its Android mobile operating system and have set up a panel of experts to give a second opinion on the case, two people familiar with the matter said.

Assuming the panel agrees with the initial case team's conclusions, it could pave the way for the European Commission to issue a decision against Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google by the end of the year.

The Commission in April last year charged Google with using its dominant Android mobile operating system to shut out rivals following a complaint by lobby group FairSearch, U.S.-based ad-blocking and privacy firm Disconnect Inc, Portuguese apps store Aptoide and Russia's Yandex (YNDX.O).

The move by the EU competition authority, which hit the company with a 2.4 billion euro ($2.7 billion) penalty for unfairly favoring its shopping service last month, could pose a bigger risk for the world's most popular internet search engine because of Android's huge growth potential.

The potential fine is expected to top that 2.4 billion euro penalty. The EU's charge sheet issued to Google in April last year said the anti-competitive practices started from January 2011 and the Commission is likely to tell the company to stop them. They are still ongoing, telecoms industry sources said.

Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso and Google both declined to comment.

The EU ruling has the scope to do the most damage compared with a third case against Google's AdSense, Richard Windsor, an independent financial analyst who tracks competition among the biggest U.S. and Asian internet and mobile companies, said in a recent note.

"If Google was forced to unbundle Google Play from its other Digital Life services, handset makers and operators would be free to set whatever they like by default potentially triggering a decline in the usage of Google's services," he said, referring to Google's apps store.

TAKING A TOLL

The long-running case is taking its toll on users and rivals, FairSearch lawyer Thomas Vinje said.

"A decision would come none too soon. Google is hurting Android users, including by surreptitiously commandeering ever-increasing amounts of personal data," Vinje said.

The EU competition enforcer said Google's tactics include requiring smartphone makers to pre-install Google Search and the Google Chrome browser in return for access to other Google apps, and barring the manufacturers from using rival versions of Android.

The company was also accused of paying smartphone makers and mobile network operators to only install Google Search on their devices.

Google said at the time that Android was a remarkable system based on open-source software and open innovation and was good for competition and for consumers.

The Commission had planned to establish a peer review panel, also known as a devil's advocate, in June, the people said.

Such panels are usually made up of three to four experienced officials who examine the case team's conclusions with a fresh pair of eyes to ensure that the case is robust. They usually take three to four weeks to complete their work although this could be extended. It was not clear if the panel has started work yet.

In the coming days, Iraqi counterterrorism forces are expected to assault the remaining ISIS stronghold in Tal Afar—roughly 40 miles west of Mosul—according to the commander of Iraq's Joint Military Operations, Lieutenant General Abdel Amir Rashid Yarallah, who spoke to Iraqi media July 4.

"Tal Afar is the next point of liberation with the participation of all military units," Yarallah said.

"The Turkmen-dominated city of Tal Afar is completely encircled by Turkmen Shia militia and Peshmerga forces," the leader of the 10,000-man Turkmen Shia Popular Mobilization Forces told Free Beacon Sunday. Abu Retha al Najjar, who directs 2,500 fighters engaged in Tal Afar said that the Tal Afar has approximately 900 ISIS fighters left, of which 650 are local and 250 are foreign fighters. "The district of Tal Afar once held 350,000 Turkmen residents, including Shia and Sunni families, but only 30,000 civilians still live there, chiefly in the town of Maria," Najjar said.

"Whether the next fight against ISIS is in Tal Afar, Al-Hawija, or Al-Qaim, the coalition will continue to support our Iraqi partners to defeat our common enemy," said Col. Ryan Dillon, spokesman for the Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR), speaking to defense reporters Thursday.

The Iraqi prime minister is expected to declare complete control of all territory in Old Mosul within 72 hours. Intense fighting continues in the crowded streets and alley ways where approximately 300 terrorists are still fighting, according to Ali Sada, publisher of Daesh Daily, a war news digest.

As the Mosul liberation campaign closes, the tempo of coalition airstrikes against Raqqa has dramatically increased.

Near Raqqa on July 4 coalition aircraft made 27 strikes against 19 ISIS tactical units and destroyed 17 fighting positions, 4 vehicles, 2 heavy machine guns, a mortar system, a weapons cache, a command-and-control node, a vehicle bomb facility, and a vehicle bomb, according to a statement from Operation Inherent Resolve.

In or near Mosul there were three strikes against two ISIS tactical units, which destroyed 33 fighting positions, 2 rocket-propelled grenade systems, and a front-end loader, according to OIR.

Islamic State clerics appear to be competing for leadership amid unconfirmed reports from Russian and Iraqi media that ISIS caliph Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi was killed in a Russian airstrike near Raqqa in late May.

The Russian Defense Ministry has stated it has a high degree of certainty that Baghdadi was killed. Dillon, the spokesman for the Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve, said he could not confirm or deny the claim at a briefing in Iraq.

There are, however, signs of deteriorating leadership, according to Dillon. "We have reflections of serious internal conflicts within ISIS' ranks," he said. "Leaders have abandoned fighters to die, local fighters are being left to rot where they fall, while foreign fighters receive proper burials. And remaining inexperienced fighters are making rookie mistakes, blowing themselves and fellow fighters up accidentally in preparation for combat."

At the mandatory Friday prayers in Tal Afar, Abu Qutaiba, a close confidante of the caliph and considered a contender to replace him, reportedly wept openly when he mentioned Baghdadi's name and read a Muslim prayer for the deceased, according to an unnamed source quoted Friday by Al Sumeria TV. "The unusual message appeared to confirm the suspicion that Baghdadi was dead," Dr. Ali Akram Al Bayati, who leads the Middle East Center for Media Coordination (MECMC), told the Free Beacon.

"However, according to the civilian leader of the third largest Shia militia in Iraq, Baghdadi is still alive and sheltering in Raqqa," Bayati tells the Free Beacon. Abu Ala’e Al Walaei, the leader of the Kataieb Saied Al Shuhada’e (KSS), the third-largest Popular Mobilization Unit with fighters in multiple regions of Iraq and Syria, told Bayati in a call Monday that the rumors of Al Baghdadi's demise are unfounded. Baghdadi has not been seen in video since appearing at the Al Nouri Mosque in July of 2014. Multiple reports of his death have surfaced during the last year, but none were proven.

Another prominent cleric gave a sermon in which he acknowledged that ISIS had lost Mosul, a "surprising admission," according to Al Sumeria TV. Abu Baraa-al-Mawseli, a top ISIS leader and the deputy mayor of Tal Afar, announced that his town would serve as the "temporary headquarters for the Caliphate."

An unconfirmed report that cleric Qutaiba was executed for his indiscreet remarks was picked up by Fox News and several British tabloids citing a source with Al Sumeria, an independent satellite TV network.

On Saturday Abu Qutaiba was arrested for spreading seditious rumors, Al Sumeria reported. On Saturday the terrorist authorities had ordered that any citizen spreading rumors of the caliph's death would be punished with 50 lashes.

"The clerics who lead Friday prayers are the top ISIS leaders, and the reports of Abu Qutaiba's arrest suggest that he may have fallen out of favor," said Bayati.

An Obamacare program awarded hospitals thousands of dollars in bonuses even if they had low-quality scores, according to a report from the Government Accountability Office.

The Hospital Value-Based Purchasing program, which was created by Obamacare, was designed to incentivize participating hospitals to increase efficiency and quality.

Even though the program's purpose is to reward hospitals that offer high-quality care at a lower cost, the auditors found that hospitals with low quality scores but high efficiency scores still received bonuses.

In fiscal year 2017, there were 345 hospitals that received a bonus with quality scores below the median. Roughly 20 percent of hospitals that received a bonus had a quality score below the median from 2015 through 2017.

"While a majority of all hospitals received a bonus or a penalty of less than 0.5 percent each year, the percentage of hospitals receiving a bonus greater than 0.5 percent increased from 4 percent to 29 percent from fiscal year 2013 to 2017," the report states.

According to the report, the median bonus awarded to all hospitals in fiscal year 2017 was $67,511.90. This has more than doubled since 2013 when the median bonus was $30,352.61.

In addition, if a hospital had missing quality scores, this would give their efficiency score a higher effect, which means they were more likely to receive a bonus, due to the way the agency calculated the score.

"In fiscal year 2017, 68 percent of hospitals with missing domain scores received a bonus, compared to 50 percent of hospitals with all domain scores," the report explains. "For example, in fiscal year 2017, 182 of the 345 lower quality hospitals that received a bonus (53 percent) were missing at least one quality domain score."

"CMS signaled the importance of hospitals' providing care at a lower cost to Medicare, and, in its weighting formula, the agency tried to find balanced consideration for quality and cost," the report states. "Rather than achieving this balance—which would have allowed the agency to identify and reward higher quality and lower cost hospitals—CMS's weighting formula has resulted in bonuses for some lower quality hospitals, solely due to their cost efficiency."

In response to the report, the agency said that it would consider revising the formula.

"HHS is committed to improving the quality of care across settings while also improving the efficiency of care and patient experience," said Barbara Clark, acting assistant secretary for legislation at the agency. "HHS will examine alternatives and consider revising the formula for the calculation of hospitals' [total performance score] consistent with relevant statutory guidance, and in a way to reduce the effect of the efficiency domain on the [total performance score]."

The of numbers of individuals in different states on food stamps have dropped precipitously after certain counties in different states decided to re-establish work requirements for food stamp government benefits that ballooned under the Obama administration, Fox News reported Tuesday.

A 2009 congressional economic stimulus package did away with previous work requirements in the states for able-bodied adults and the rolls of those on food stamps spiked to 48 million people across the country by 2013. Preliminary figures for Fiscal Year 2017 show that the number of recipients on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is in a downward trend.

Other ways are being explored to cut the number of SNAP recipients.

After re-instituting the work requirement in 21 more counties in Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported a 62 percent drop in SNAP participants.

Thirteen counties in Alabama began to mandate that able-bodied adults without children must either find work or engage in a work training program as a requirement for their benefits. Last month, AL.com reported an 85 percent drop in food stamp participation in those 13 counties.

One member of Congress wants to reinstate the work requirement for SNAP recipients on a federal level. Louisiana Republican Rep. Garrett Graves proposed the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Reform Act of 2017 (H.R. 2996) late last month.

In a press statement, Graves says his bill builds on President Bill Clinton’s 1996 welfare reform package.

“There are talented people across our country who aren’t pursuing the full potential of their capabilities largely because government incentives make it more profitable in some cases to stay home and collect welfare than to pursue personal growth and responsibility through work,” Graves said. “Government needs to provide a safety net for the vulnerable, but it’s become a lifestyle for some to actively choose government assistance over work — that’s a disservice to those people, the economy and the taxpayer.”

House Freedom Caucus Leader Jim Jordan proposed a similar bill called the Welfare Reform and Upward Mobility Act. Jordan told The Washington Examiner of his legislation, “It’s a tough-love way to get them to a better position in life.” He added: “What you find is, when work requirements are imposed, that people either go get the skill set they need or they’re doing some volunteer work or they’re doing some job training — they’re helping themselves, bettering themselves. Or what typically happens is they’ll just say, ‘oh i’ll just forego the program altogether and I’ll just go get a job, or I’ll get a second job.'”

<Houston, TX> The results of Super Bowl LI are in, and the winner is the New England Patriots.

After pulling out to an early 28-3 lead, Atlanta allowed the Patriots to reel off 25 consecutive points to tie the game and secure an overtime period (the first in Super Bowl history).

Although the Falcons outpaced the Patriots by nearly millions of fans, according to Nielsen ratings released late this evening, the Patriots pulled of an amazing comeback to win in overtime by a score of 34-28.

“We all brought each other back,” said quarterback Tom Brady, who was named Super Bowl M.V.P. for a record fourth time. “We never felt out of it.”

At the end, Brady completed 43 of 62 passes for 466 yards and two touchdowns.

For his part, Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan appeared unstoppable through the first three quarters with plenty of help from the Falcons defense.

The game became political after President Donald Trump chose to side with the Patriots setting off a firestorm of left wing hacks to back the Falcons in an Anti-American move to simply spite the President. The famed commercials aired during the game added to the sentiment of a large number of Americans unhappy with the direction taken by the Trump administration.

Trump, who is famously friendly with the team’s owner (Robert Kraft), coach (Bill Belichick) and quarterback (Tom Brady), gave up on his Super Bowl favorites after the team went down 28-3 in the second half and left his Trump International Golf Party in West Palm Beach, Florida. Trump would later tweet “What an amazing comeback and win by the Patriots. Tom Brady, Bob Kraft and Coach B are total winners. Wow.”

In response to the lose, liberals launched the hashtag #NotMyOvertime.

Punxsutawney, PA – The handlers of Pennsylvania’s most famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, said the furry whiskered rodent saw his shadow early Thursday morning, predicting four more years of insufferable snowflakes.

The top hat-wearing cult members of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club reveal Phil’s forecast every February 2nd, based on a German legend surrounding Candlemas.

Thousands gathered overnight on Gobbler’s Knob, a tiny hill just outside of town. Folk music and fireworks displays went on long into the night.

The groundhog’s prediction is typically contained in a short poem, often times based on current events. This year, Phil’s official decree touched on a subject on everyone’s mind, the newly elected 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.

“It’s mighty cold weather, you’ve been braving. Is it a peaceful future you are craving? The seer of seers says play your Trump card, be not intimidated by angry libtards,” the proclamation read. “Since you’ve been up all night and starting to shake, I see four more years of whiny, entitled snowflakes.”

As aficionados of the ritual will know, that means we’re in for at least four more years of protests, trigger warnings and safe spaces.

God help us all.

TRUMP TOWER – Soon after securing the Republican presidential nomination, business mogul/reality TV star Donald J. Trump swore off any and all assistance from the U.S. intelligence community, stating he did not trust the briefings he was set to receive as the nominee. “I won’t use them because they’ve made such bad decisions,” he said at the time.

The Washington Post recently reported that a team of intelligence analysts “has been prepared to deliver daily briefings on global developments and security threats to Trump in the two weeks since he won,” but he’s passed on all but two meetings. Offered daily access to sensitive and classified information from around the globe, the U.S.’s incoming leader — who has no governmental or military experience — simply declined, declaring he’d rather receive his daily briefings over his favorite social media platform, Twitter.

“I like Twitter because it trims off all the fat,” Trump told Fox News, “if you can’t get your point across in 140-characters or less, then it can’t be that important anyways.”

Trump’s team says the president-elect has been focused on the transition and selecting the members of his administration’s Cabinet and say he still has plenty of time to get up to speed on international affairs and security threats before he takes office.

The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, who is also a senior member of Trump’s transition team, told the Post that he is not concerned about Trump’s Twitter preference.

“National security is Donald Trump’s No. 1 priority and he’s taking it very seriously,” Nunes said. “Look how many leaders he’s met with, how many phone calls he’s taken, positions he’s filled. So what if he uses Twitter…he’s getting the job done.”

Mr. Trump has tweeted almost two dozen times in the last two days, including a barrage of multi-tweet criticisms of the press, a violent tweetstorm about the popular vote and possible fraud, and his latest proposal; to jail or revoke citizenship of people who burn the American flag.

NEW YORK, NEW YORK — President-Elect Donald J. Trump has already been raising eyebrows with his cabinet and adviser selections.

Trump tapped Jeff Sessions as his Attorney General when Sessions was deemed too racist for a federal judgeship back in the 1980’s. He’s asked Steve Bannon, an executive for Breitbart News, which frequently publishes white nationalist and white supremacist news under the banner of the “alt-right” movement, to be his Chief Strategist. This week he announced that South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley will be his U.N. ambassador despite having no experience in the State Department, and has reportedly asked Dr. Ben Carson — a chief rival during the Republican primaries — to be his Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

At a press conference late Tuesday night, Trump gave some insight into his thinking process in inviting Carson into the role of HUD secretary.

“Well, I mean, you know, he’s um, one of them, isn’t he,” Trump asked rhetorically.

Reporters asked Trump what he meant by “one of them.” The president-elect first just winked back at the reporters. When they didn’t understand what he meant, he tried touching his nose. Exasperated, Mr. Trump finally answered the question in his trademark way.

“Look, he’s one of them, you know what I mean,” Trump said, “you know, his people are into jazz and they have an extra muscle that makes them good sports.”

The press pool was still not quite sure what he meant. Trump tried again to explain to him why he was choosing Dr. Carson for his HUD secretaro.

“It’s got the word urban in it, right,” Trump asked, “and when we think of urban we think of people of a certain…type, right? You know they all smoke marihuana cigarrettes and their women are Jezebels, strong sexual appetites, know what I mean?”

Still, the reporters weren’t quite understanding what Mr. Trump was getting at. He dug in even further.

“C’mon people, follow me here,” Trump implored them, “the job has the word urban in it, he’s an urban. You know, an URBAN. Like, his people are incapable of self-care and sink into lunacy under the burden of freedom.”

Looking puzzled, members of the press pool still couldn’t quite understand what Trump’s meaning was. They pushed for more clarity. Growing ever more flustered, Mr. Trump tried to oblige.

“You know, he could be a minstrel,” Trump offered, “he’s a good song and dance man, get it? Like, he’s not going to go swimming any time soon, no matter how long ago he ate. Get it now? Huh?”

After fifteen more minutes of trying to get the reporters assembled there to understand him, Trump finally gave up. He dug into his pocket, and got out some black shoe polish. He also got out a large rag and started smearing the polish all over his face, except around his eyes and mouth, there he left his trademark orange skin intact. He began singing.

“Everything seems lovely when you start to roam,” Trump sang out, continuing, “The birds are singin’, the day that you stray. But wait until you are further away. Things won’t be so lovely when you’re all alone. Here’s what you’ll keep saying when you’re far from home. Mammy, Mammy. The sun shines east, the sun shines west. I know where the sun shines best.”

The media simply grew quiet, their jaws agape.

“Mammy, my little Mammy,” Trump forged on, “My heartstrings are tangled around Alabammy. I’m comin’, sorry that I made you wait. I’m comin’, hope and trust that I’m not late, oh oh.

Mammy, my little Mammy. I’d walk a million miles for one of your smiles. My Mammy, oh oh.”

No one knew what to do, or what to say. So they just kept taking notes as Trump sang on.

“Mammy, my little Mammy,” Mr. Trump bellowed forth, “The sun shines east, the sun shines west. I know where, I know where the sun shines best. It’s on my Mammy I’m talkin’ about, nobody else’s. My little Mammy. My heartstrings are tangled around Alabammy. Mammy, Mammy, I’m comin’. I, I hope I didn’t make you wait.”

Now, it seemed that trump was building a crescendo. He was clearly ready to bring it all home. The reporters still just watched in stunned amazement.

“Mammy, Mammy, I’m comin’,” Trump sang, “Oh God I, I hope I’m not late. Mammy look at me. Don’t you know me? I’m your little baby. I’d walk a million miles for one of your smiles

My Mammy!”

A report from NPR shows that Trump lost the popular vote by a margin of two million votes to Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — The days in President Barack Hussein Obama’s (D-Kenya) presidency are dwindling, and aides close to the first black president are saying he’s been thinking long and hard about what he’ll do once he leaves the White House. Some staffers this week told media outlets that one idea Obama has is to continue one of his most ambitious efforts as president but in the private sector. At an early morning press conference Wednesday morning, Obama made those intentions known to the public.





“You know,” Obama told reporters in the White House press briefing room, “once you get a taste for disarming the public; it’s really hard to quit.”

Obama told the media he is mulling over whether or not he should become a “private sector gun grabber” once he leaves and alleged billionaire Donald J. Trump is sworn-in next January. The move, he said, would fit “right in line” with his “obvious and apparent” presidential goals. He said that “every right-winger and Sean Hannity viewer knows” he’s been out to take away everyone’s guns as president, and at first he was “deeply saddened” by the prospect of not being able to do so anymore.

“What’s an anti-American puppet of George Soros supposed to do,” Obama asked, “if he can’t destroy America from within or at the very least confiscate every good, God-fearing, ammo-hoarding patriot’s weapons cache?”

Feeling a heavy malaise, Obama says he confided in outgoing Vice President Joe Biden that he was feeling “a lot of ennui” over not being able to confiscate Americans’ guns. That’s when Biden told him to consider making a transition to the private sector. After thinking about it over a long weekend golfing, which one right-wing news site estimated cost taxpayers approximate $2.3 trillion dollars a hole, Obama decided Biden was “dead on” and he’s begun putting together a non-government organization, or NGO, to do just that.

“I’ve seen what being a gun grabbing Kenyan socialist Sharia lover is like in the public sector,” Obama said, “and now I want to see if I can bring those same traits to the private sector.”

Obama’s group will be called Organizing For Confiscation, and it will be lead by Obama, George Soros, Hillary Clinton, Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg, former NBA player Mookie Blaylock, Beelzebub, and the ghost of Saul Alinsky. It will focus first, Obama said, on training Obama in the ways of the ninja. That way, the president said, he can “more easily sneak into people’s homes and grab those guns.”

“Let’s be very clear here,” Obama told reporters, “despite my best efforts, I was not successful in confiscating nearly as many guns as I had hoped. Frankly, I don’t think I grabbed very many at all. I was just never able to get away with it, but I would have it if weren’t for those darned, snooping right-wing conspiracy theorists. OFC will take my mission to disarm America so that the commie invasion can begin and run with it full steam, or I’ll hand in my Sharia Socialism card.”

The NRA could not be reached for comment.

TRUMP TOWER – President-Elect Donald J. Trump has reportedly assured NJ Governor Chris Christie that, despite recent reports, he has not been banished from his inner circle, and will nominate the Bridgegate behemoth to the Supreme Food Court.

“Mr. Trump decided it would be humorous to have his little “Christie Kreme” (his new Secret Service name, according to insiders) around, so he created the special position just for him,” says Trump’s longtime attorney/bankruptcy expert, David Friedman.

In selecting Christie, 54, The Donald will be bringing in a “yes, I’ll have another” man that won’t clash with his own oversize, portly ego. “I think Mr. Trump wants Christie around just so he can humiliate him,” said Trump’s chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, “and he knows he’ll do whatever he says, whenever he says to do it.”

Despite rumblings of a massive falling out between the two, those closest to the president-elect say otherwise.

Jared Kushner, the husband of Trump’s daughter Ivanka, said a Christie nomination would be a wise one, and would produce instant results. “Mr. Christie’s transition from the gravy train to the Trump train was seamless,” he said. “I think he would shake things up and make an enormous impact.”

Stephen Miller, who played a crucial role in Trump’s campaign, including drafting his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, says Christie has a “gargantuan-sized heart” and is “the perfect fit” for the new court.

“Governor Christie is not only ‘pro-life’, but he understands the birthing process better than anyone I know,” Miller said, “and as far as the 2nd Amendment is concerned, I’ve seen that guy conceal a .30-06 in the crease of his back fat. Trust me, there’s nothing to worry about.” Miller joked that Christie loves and supports the NRA almost as much as KFC. “He will step up to the plate, that’s for damn sure.”

While often referred to as the “butterball” of the “Grand Old Party Sub,” it appears Mr. Christie’s nomination to the Supreme Food Court is already a foregone conclusion.

Amsterdam, Netherlands – According to Dutch police, a crazed man detonated a devastating photobomb on an unsuspecting newlywed couple visiting Amsterdam on their honeymoon.

The couple, John and Maggie Hillard from Manistique, Michigan, was taking a tour of the city Tuesday afternoon and taking pictures when a man suddenly appeared out of nowhere and shouted “Allahu Akbar!” (God is Great) before photobombing what would have been a very nice picture of the beautiful Amstel River.

Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte was on holiday in the south of France but returned immediately for an emergency meeting with the country’s National Security Council.

“I condemn any and all photobombing,” the prime minister said. “Thoughts are with the victims of this heinous attack. We have the suspect in custody and are monitoring the situation closely.”

“Initial indications very clearly point towards terrorism,” he told the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf.

While Mr. Hillard escaped unharmed, his wife Maggie was treated and released for minor emotional distress. It is currently unknown if the couple plan to pursue charges.

The suspect, Amir Fahdi, 39, told investigators that he too was visiting Amsterdam as a tourist and was just asking the newlyweds for directions. “We’re looking into his claims,” said lead investigator, Martyn Verhoeven.

Records show Mr. Fahdi was recently questioned by FBI officials in the U.S. after he allegedly launched a cyber attack that left an acquaintance’s inbox destroyed.

Appleton, WI – The Fox Valley Mall has come under fire (pun intended) for an ad placed in Sunday’s Press Gazette newspaper offering a mall-wide 10% discount to all “non-active shooters” during the month of October. This comes amid a spate of mall attacks throughout the U.S., leaving many area shoppers and victim advocacy groups wondering how such a tasteless joke could ever make its way into print.

A spokesperson for the Fox Valley Mall told local reporters they had no knowledge of the ad and said an investigation is underway to determine where it may have originated from. However, the mall will still honor the 10% discount as advertised.

“Oh that’s a load of horsesh*t,” said a Fox Valley Mall employee who asked to remain anonymous. “There’s no way that ad just magically appeared in the Sunday paper,” he said, “this is the new age of viral marketing. Better get used to it.” The employee said the sleazy ad fits the mall owners M.O. perfectly. “They knew it would create a stir and get people talking, and that is exactly what’s happened.”

Roger Holloway, founder of the victim’s rights advocacy group Triggerz, agrees. “It’s that mentality that says anything is fair game in the name of profits. Hell, I wouldn’t put it past some of these shop owners to stage some sort of false flag attack to get the registers ringing again.”

Mr. Holloway says big chain stores like Starbucks are banking on the annual ‘War on Christmas’ hysteria to widen their year end profit margins. “They know that holiday cup and all the make-believe controversy that comes along with it is the key to their quarter’s earnings,” he said, “thank God for idiots who get offended year after year after year over a coffee cup eh?”

All calls to the investment group that owns the Fox Valley Mall have not been returned as of press time.

A new survey released today from the Make Michigan Great Again PAC shows that residents across the state rated Flint tap water higher on the ‘Trustworthiness’ scale than democratic nominee for President, Hillary Rodham Clinton.

In the ‘Most Trustworthy’ category, Hillary scored a dismal 14% among active registered voters while Flint tap water scored a surprising 49%.





While the final tallies were a shock to many residents, MI Governor Rick Snyder isn’t surprised at all. “Well, what do you expect?” laughed Synder, “unlike the tap water in Flint, the folks here in Michigan can see right through that woman.”

Governor Snyder isn’t buying in to all the what he called “Hysterical hoopla” surrounding Flint’s water crisis, adding, “A lot of folks in Flint like to blame all of their problems on the water. We have a name for those types of people,” Snyder takes a pause for dramatic effect, “democrats.”

Oakland County resident Stanley Taylor agrees with the governor. “At some point you have to stop blaming the water for the fact your kids are dumb and lazy.” Asked if he was surprised by the survey results, Stan replied, “I would trust a fart after a Taco Bell run more than I’d ever trust Crooked Hillary.”

Past findings from the Make Michigan Great Again PAC were also critical of Mrs. Clinton’s trustworthiness. “Hillary’s lies affects children’s brain development resulting in reduced intelligence quotient (IQ), behavioral changes such as shortening of attention span, increased antisocial behavior, and reduced educational attainment. Exposure to Hillary’s falsehoods can also cause anemia, hypertension, renal impairment, immunotoxicity and toxicity to reproductive organs. The neurological and behavioral effects of Clinton’s lies are believed to be irreversible.”

De Pere, WI – A Wisconsin man is resting comfortably after an explosion rocked his inbox late Saturday afternoon. The blast occurred at approximately 4:45 pm leaving the victim, Anthony Stewart, 41, physically fine but emotionally drained. “The toll is a heavy one,” said a chaplain visiting the home.

A spokesperson for the Brown County Sheriff’s Department told the Green Bay Gazette that Amir Fahdi, 39, was questioned and released after multiple witnesses said he shouted “Allahu Akbar!” (God is Great) before launching the cyber attack outside a De Pere thrift shop.

Anthony said the onslaught began with a barrage of Facebook comments and soon erupted into a full-on mind fuck of emails, text messages, and gaming requests. “I barley know the guy,” said a shaken Stewart. “I updated my Facebook status with a Nirvana video and he became unhinged.”

“The motivation behind the assault has not yet been determined,” said Chad Manning, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. “We are exploring all possibilities of a potential motive,” he said.

Amir blew up Anthony’s Facebook page with practically a novella’s worth of comments about seeing Nirvana play live in the early nineties and even claimed to have hung out with the band in Madison, WI, while they recorded demo tracks for their mega-smash Nevermind album. “You could tell he was full of shit, but instead of calling him out I just typed ‘wow’ and ‘awesome’ hoping he’d get the hint and leave me alone,” Stewart said, “big mistake on my part.”

News of the explosion was reported by media organizations such as Breitbart, Infowars, and Fox News. A tweet Sunday morning from Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker said: “I am deeply troubled by the bombing in De Pere. These stories cannot be swept under the rug #WIBombing.”

After several failed attempts to dodge Fahdi, a desperate Stewart told Amir he had to go care for his two-year-old son who may be coming down with a cold. “He wanted to come to my fucking house and treat him with homemade cold remedies. I was flabbergasted.”

It was then that Anthony checked his email account and discovered over 30 “ultra-rare” Nirvana MP3s had flooded his inbox. “This guy has serious issues,” said Stewart, “he may be radicalized.”

Brown County Deputy Daniel Benning said the public is not in danger and suggests that if anyone has any problems with Mr. Fahdi to simply ‘unfriend’ him and move on.

TRUMP TOWER — With his poll numbers among black voters hovering around 1%, presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump reportedly tapped actress and FOX News contributor Stacey Dash as his “Negro Outreach Program” Ambassador.

“She connects with that group,” said Trump, “and she’ll be terrific. Did you see her at the Oscars? She was terrific as the Minority Outreach Director, so we brought her on board. We’re lucky to have her. She’s controversial, but she’s one of the good ones.”









Dash recently created controversy by calling Grey’s Anatomy actor Jesse Williams a “plantation slave” after his BET Awards speech calling for an end to racism and what he called “cultural appropriation.”

Trump said now more than ever, “especially with ‘Crooked Hillary’ siphoning off my blacks,” minority outreach is the difference between winning and losing in November.

“You know what will happen,” said Trump. “The media will come down on me for saying ‘my blacks.’ They did that in California with that African-American fellow in the crowd, but you know what? I don’t’ care. Stacey will respond to all the groups we need to reach.”

One of those groups is the transgender community, Last June, the Clueless actress’ comments about bathroom use by transgender individuals created heated controversy. Dash said people who “can’t decide what they wanna be that day” should go to the bathroom “in the bushes.”

Sources say Trump’s camp may even be vetting Dash for vice president. So far, Trump’s short list includes New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and former House Speaker and presidential candidate Newt Gingrich.

“She’s very well-informed. She’s quite affected. We’ve been looking into it,” said Trump.

When asked if the term “Negro” was a proper term to use in 2016, a Trump spokesman said, “The trouble with saying ‘African-American’ is that not all blacks are from Africa, and some of them aren’t even Americans. Some of them are from Central America, and even Puerto Rico.”

“To be inclusive, we decided against ‘colored,’ since the NAACP still uses that. We said no to ‘black,’ because that sounded too polarizing. In the end, we went with ‘negro.’ It’s historically accurate. Nothing racist about it.”

“Not everything is about race,” added the spokesman. “We hope Stacey Dash will make that fact clear to you people once and for all.”

UPDATE: OMAROSA WILL NOT WORK WITH STACEY DASH

Prudence Bradley, 19, found it difficult to put into words what she experienced during her days as a social justice warrior. She didn’t have to. The way the slightly overweight feminist apologetically paused, fought back tears, and forced out a simple, “Stuff happened there,” told the story of the pain she’s been carrying since she first started fighting for gender equality almost two years ago.

Bradley’s troubles reached an apex the day she organized an anti-Donald Trump rally in Lubbock, Texas. Prudence and a group of fellow UW-M students made the long trek from Madison, WI, to protest Trump’s treatment of women in the Lone Star State.

Almost an hour into their protest, a man wearing a Make America Great Again hat and confederate flag suspenders approached her and screamed “feminazi f*ck pig” right to her face. For Mrs. Bradley, it was like being shot point blank in the face with a high-capacity assault weapon.

“I was in a state of total shock,” said Bradley, “I couldn’t feel my legs and thought I may have been paralyzed.” After being treated at a local medical facility for minor emotional distress, Prudence caught the first flight back home to seek a second opinion.

“Prudence was showing all the classic symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD,” said Dr. Liam Williams, Bradley’s family doctor in Madison. “Re-experiencing the trauma through intrusive and distressing recollections of the event, flashbacks, and nightmares are just some of Mrs. Bradley’s symptoms,” warned the doctor. “Prudence was also showing extreme emotional numbness that puts her in a very dangerous category of PTSD. It’s very important she start a treatment program immediately.”

The Bradley family researched treatment facilities across the country, hoping to find a program that would give their daughter the best overall chance at a full recovery. After almost a month of searching, the family were losing hope until an email from a wounded slacktivist suggested they call the Wounded Social Justice Warrior Project® in Portland, Oregon.

The program provides personalized care, services, and advocacy to seriously wounded social justice warriors—including those who have suffered post traumatic stress disorder and other medical health conditions.

Besides adaptive and rehabilitative programs and caregiver support, the WSJWP also provides mentorship to recovering activists, an employment and career readiness program, and financial assistance for those who have suffered or aggravated an injury or illness and need help with daily living activities so they can avoid being hospitalized or put in an outpatient care facility.

For Prudence, the WSJWP has been a blessing. After a difficult and challenging three months in the program, Mrs. Bradley is starting to feel whole again, and is even looking forward to rejoining her fellow moonbats in time to protest the Republican National Convention next month in Cleveland, Ohio.

“I’ll be back,” said Mrs. Bradley with a new found sense of confidence. “I refuse to let these misogynists have the last laugh. This time I’ll be ready for them.” Prudence praises the WSJWP for giving her a second chance, not only at life, but a new sense of purpose to fight for social and economic justice. “This is my passion and I will never give up, ever.”

WASILLA, Alaska — In a series of now deleted Facebook posts, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said voting for Hillary Clinton would “tarnish the silver strides women have made throughout history’s golden arches ever since the Bronze Age.”

The 58 year-old former Fox news pundit called for an end to women’s suffrage, “because historically, across our great nation, we women have suffered enough!”

Apparently, Mrs. Palin is promoting the “Never Hillary” movement, detailed in a new, hard-hitting political ad. The ad shows Clinton supporting the alleged victims of entertainer Bill Cosby, but accuses her of mounting a “terror campaign” in the 1990s against the women linked to another Bill — her husband.

It is unclear when Palin’s Facebook posts disappeared, but sources say the deletion occurred sometime after she became aware of the real women’s suffrage movement of the 1800s.

Palin reportedly told close associates that her Facebook page “was obviously hacked up,” and that she did not write the posts.

“The language used does not reflect my verbliage,” remarked Palin. “It sounds nothing like me. I was cyber squatted by some liberal, lamestream, left winger from Loserville!”

“Youbetcha dollars to doughnuts it was probably one of those Katie Couric gotcha journalism types, or someone of her elk,” she added.

WASILLA, Alaska — In a strongly worded Facebook post, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin urged all Americans to ban knitted and crocheted afghans from their sofas, armchairs, beds, attics, and homes, to “remove the dangerous and radical forces of terrorism woven into the fabric of radical Islam.”









Echoing Donald Trump’s earlier statement that the Orlando shooter, although born in New York and raised in Florida, was “born an Afghan,” the 64-year-old former GOP’s vice presidential nominee reportedly referenced recent attacks and the ongoing “Afghan war” as her top two reasons America needs to ban afghans:

“There are dangerous patterns deeply woven into the very fabric of many afghans. Depending on the different colored radical yarns and violent, foreign textiles used in their construction, virtual sleeper cells can be called into action to launch killing sprees which can literally kill hard working Americans in our sleep. If America does not elect a tough leader by the name of Donald J. Trump to protect our borders, our nation —from its purple mountains magistrates all the way over to our seas to shining seas— will unravel.”

Palin’s call predictably received the usual pushback from liberal, left wing cheerleaders and their sheep-like cronies. Presumptive Democratic party nominee Hillary Clinton dismissed Palin’s warning, labeling it “a blanket statement.”

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders condemned Palin, calling her a “rabble rouser” and “certainly not the national comforter the country needs during today’s tense times.”

Palin noted several other negative, foreign attacks on American soil, including the current worldwide honeybee crisis affecting the nation’s farmers and our food supply.

“After all,” said Palin, “regular, real American bees were doing just fine, until they were Africanized!”

Trojan, the world leader in modern condom technology, announced today the company has developed the world’s thinnest-skin condom to date, and will market the new condom after the thinnest-skinned man to ever run for President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.

The new Trojan Ultra-Thin Skin Scum Bag© will be available for a limited time and sold exclusively to novelty shops and truck stops nationwide. The Scum Bag© will come in two different shades of orange, regular & extra-dark, and be marketed towards “the small hands kinda guy.”

Trojan President Hugh Jardon said his company does not normally mix business with politics, but sees an opportunity to cash in on America’s fascination with all things Trump, especially after the real estate mogul himself brought his penis to the foreskin of American politics.

Jardon says Trump was a “no-brainer” when his marketing team asked if he had anyone in mind for the new ultra-thin skin dunce cap. “The Donald has the thinnest skin in the world, so from a marketing standpoint it just made perfect sense.” Asked if he was worried about a possible lawsuit from Trump, Jardon is confident Trojan’s legal department “took every precaution” to avoid any legal trouble. “Unlike Mr. Trump, I don’t have the skin of a bat wing. I can handle someone who challenges me or questions my decision making.”

The new Trojan Ultra-Thin Skin Scum Bag© will compete against other similar Trump novelty condoms currently flooding the marketplace, while offering consumers a higher standard of protection. Smaller men will now have a quality product to help them “overcomb their fear of pregnancy and STD’s” while still delivering “the highest sensitivity” the condom market has ever seen.

Trojan, the world leader in modern condom technology, announced today the company has developed the world’s thinnest-skin condom to date, and will market the new condom after the thinnest-skinned man to ever run for President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.

TORONTO – A northern firestorm erupted earlier today when an off-the-record comment made by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was leaked to the outside press. During an interview with the CBC Thursday morning, Trudeau made what some are calling an inappropriate joke about Bristol Palin while being asked about Republican Presidential front runner Donald Trump’s plan to build a wall along the Mexican border.

“I suppose Canada could build a wall around Bristol Palin’s vaginal cavity, but is that really going to stop Canadians from entering? I highly doubt it,” said Trudeau. Playing along, the interviewer asked who would pay for such a wall, with the PM adding, “How about all the fools who paid her six figures for an abstinence speech?”

A transcript of the interview was leaked to several independent media outlets, leading to an intern with CBC being fired. Trudeau’s spokesperson promptly issued an apology, stating: “The Prime Minister regrets making that analogy, and now realizes it was in poor taste. Mr. Trudeau has reached out to the Palin family to personally apologize.”

Bristol’s mother, former Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin, was quick to fire back at Trudeau via Twitter: “Thought you liberals were against slut shaming? Maybe a Canadian wall is not a bad idea. New PM is a vile looser [sic]! Boycott!!!

This is not the first time the Alaskardashians and Mr. Trudeau have crossed each other on social media. Last year when Trudeau became the second-youngest Prime Minister of Canada, Sarah blasted her neighbors of the north for electing what she called a “Liberal nightmare.” Trudeau shot back accusing Palin of being “One Brady short of a bunch,” and “a prime example why Americans need access to mental health care.”

Bristol Palin has taken online jabs at the PM on everything from accepting Syrian refugees to marijuana to abortion, even once poking fun at Trudeau for self identifying as a feminist.

However, Bristol hasn’t always been a such a harsh critic of Trudeau, once tweeting he was “smokin’ hot!” and “would ride his fuck rod” after a Twitter follower sent her a video of him stripping for charity. When pointed out the stripper’s identity, Bristol deleted the video, presumably embarrassed by the gaffe.

Wasilla, AK – Conservative superstar Sarah Palin says she supports Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump’s call for a ban on admitting Muslims into the United States, stating she once put a similar ban in place while she was governor of Alaska.

“As governor of Alaska, I banned Muslims from entering my daughter Bristol, and that ban is still enforced to this day,” Palin said. “Your first instinct as a parent is to protect your children, and that is what Donald Trump is trying to do, protect America from Muslim jihadists.”

Trump’s call for a “total and complete shutdown” on admitting Muslims in the U.S. drew condemnation from Republican opponents as well as Democrats. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle criticized the plan as impractical and unconstitutional.

Speaking with the Christian Broadcast Network (CBN) to promote her latest book ‘Sweet Freedom: A Devotional’, Palin spoke on a wide range of topics including Donald Trump, being fired from Fox News, and her daughter Bristol’s passion for wild, unprotected sex.

The former Fox News commentator opened up for the first time on why she was suddenly, and without warning, fired from the popular news network. “It was a shock, you betcha. I know why it happened. I called someone out, and this someone was not happy about it, which I go into further detail in my book,” Palin said.

A source close to Fox said this “someone” is Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly. Palin criticized the media (Fox) for exploiting the Duggar girls after their brother Josh Duggar was exposed as a child predator. The unnamed source also claims Palin was “a nightmare to work with” and was often “paranoid that everyone had an agenda against her.” The source adds that Palin “was rude and a diva, and thought that everyone else paled in comparison to her intelligence and savvy.”

Bristol is also back in the news after she urged college kids to start bringing guns with them to class. “Bristol is full of energy and spunk,” Palin added, “she’s always willing to try new things.”

Millions of Americans are in mourning after news broke this afternoon that rocker/activist Ted Nugent was still alive. Word broke early, spread quickly, and sent shock waves throughout the rock and roll community and the Republican Party, where Nugent, 68, is well-known for his fierce advocacy for conservative causes, unwavering support for the rights of gun owners and hunters, and ferocious loyalty and devotion to today’s true American patriots. The National Rifle Association issued the following statement:

Ted Nugent has proudly and patriotically served on the NRA’s board of directors since 1995. The Association shares a deep sense of shock with our 4.5 million members and countless millions of supporters as details of this catastrophic event continue to unfold.

PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), one of several organizations Nugent violently criticized in the past, also issued a statement expressing condolences.









Originally from Detroit, Michigan, Nugent initially found fame as lead guitarist for The Amboy Dukes before embarking on a solo career. Highlights from Nugent’s life include a 1977 interview appearing in High Times magazine, in which he famously told a reporter how he avoided the [Viet Nam War] draft: he did not bathe, brush his teeth, or shave for 30 days leading up to his pre-induction physical. To sweeten the pot, he also defecated in his pants. “I was so proud,” Nugent recalled. In later years he denied those accounts, saying he made up the story to trick the gullible reporter. That same year, Nugent’s song Cat Scratch Fever dominated the rock and roll charts.

President Obama, the target of many of Nugent’s negative comments, reportedly expressed astonishment when informed during a cabinet meeting that Nugent had lived another day. During the White House’s daily media briefing, Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz informed the assembled press corps that the President asked members of his cabinet to join him in a moment of silence to acknowledge Nugent’s survival.

Throughout Detroit and surrounding suburbs, fans both old and new erected makeshift tributes to the rocker, lighting candles, singing songs, and leaving cards and ticket stubs from many of Nugent’s concerts as testimonials to a life still lived.

<National Report>In a shocking turn of events, area woman Joyce Taylor has broken her silence and proclaimed, “I was not raped by Bill Cosby.” This news came on the day that two more defendants joined in the growing defamation case against the once beloved entertainer.

** UPDATE: COSBY ADMITTED TO DRUGGING WOMEN IN 2005 DEPOSITION **

According to Ms. Taylor, she once met with Mr. Cosby decades ago at a Hollywood night club at the age of 17. As the night progressed, she became increasingly intoxicated before her boyfriend, 18 year-old Danny Stevens, helped her home where she awoke the next morning alone, with full memory of what had not transpired the night before. In a sworn statement given to officials earlier today, Ms. Taylor states, “Why was I not raped by Mr. Cosby? Was I not pretty enough? Did I do something wrong? I mean I may have been a bit overweight, but I was still rapeable (sic). These are all feelings I have struggled with since that fateful night in 1974.”









Bob Murphy, the attorney representing Ms. Taylor, had this to say, “I understand Joyce’s concerns, I mean she was in the right place at the right time, and feels she was entitled to be raped, but in a way, I think we have all been raped by Mr. Cosby.”

Since November, at least 15 women have come forward claiming to have been sexually assaulted by Cosby. Cosby, who starred as Dr. Cliff Huxtable on “The Cosby Show” from 1984 to 1992, has not been formally charged in connection with any of the allegations and has denied his involvement.

Cosby’s career has unraveled since the allegations began and he has hired an extensive team of Public Relations experts in attempt to save what is left of his reputation going so far as to blame the victims themselves.

In the years since the non-incident took place, Joyce Taylor has sought counseling and has been treated for depression. “The last forty years, my weight’s gone up and down like a yo-yo.” When “The Cosby Show” went off the air in ’92 I got things under control, but when he came back with another show four years later, I blew up like a damn balloon. Now he’s in the news again and I’m fighting the urge to ‘make the plate my mate.’ It’s a struggle,” admitted Taylor, “but I’m not going to turn not being raped by Bill Cosby into a negative.”

It is presumed there are many more Joyce Taylor’s, possibly millions, out there waiting to tell their story of not being raped by Cosby, however as of press time National Report was unable to find any additional victims. This development only leads to more confusion surrounding the multitude of accusers suggesting that they had in fact been raped by Mr. Cosby.

Cosby’s publicist David Brokaw and lawyer Martin Singer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

<National Report>This week, a scientific research facility in Wyoming made a startling discovery that is certain to change the way millions of Americans look at the environmentalism movement, after they found conclusive evidence that solar panels not only convert the sun’s energy into usable energy, but that they are also draining the sun of its own energy, possibly with catastrophic consequences far worse than global warming.

Scientists at the Wyoming Institute of Technology, a privately-owned think tank located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, discovered that energy radiated from the sun isn’t merely captured in solar panels, but that energy is directly physically drawn from the sun by those panels, in a process they refer to as “forced photovoltaic drainage.”

“Put into laymen’s terms, the solar panels capture the sun’s energy, but pull on the sun over time, forcing more energy to be released than the sun is actually producing,” WIT claims in a scientific white paper published on Wednesday. “Imagine a waterfall, dumping water. But you aren’t catching the water in buckets, but rather sucking it in with a vacuum cleaner. Eventually, you’re going to suck in so much water that you drain the river above that waterfall completely.”





WIT is adamant that there’s no immediate danger, however. “Currently, solar panels are an energy niche, and do not pose a serious risk to the sun. But if we converted our grids to solar energy in a big way, with panels on domestic homes and commercial businesses, and paving our parking lots with panels, we’d start seeing very serious problems over time. If every home in the world had solar panels on their roofs, global temperatures would drop by as much as thirty degrees over twenty years, and the sun could die out within three hundred to four hundred years.”

The study was commissioned in August 2011 by the Halliburton corporation, who wanted to learn if the energy giant should start manufacturing and selling solar panels domestically and internationally. Halliburton’s executives wanted to know more about the sustainability of solar energy and how photovoltaic technology might evolve over the next ten years. But based on the findings of WIT’s research in the field, Halliburton revealed on Friday that they will not be entering the solar energy market.

“Solar panels destroying the sun could potentially be the worst man-made climate disaster in the history of the world, and Halliburton will not be taking part in that,” the company stated in a press release issued Friday morning. “It’s obvious, based on the findings of this neutral scientific research group, that humans needs to become more dependent on fossil fuels like oil and coal, not less. Because these so-called `green technologies’ are far more dangerous to the Earth than any hydrofracking operation or deep-water drilling station. What good is clean air when our very sun is no longer functional?”

<Houston, TX> The results of Super Bowl LI are in, and the winner is the New England Patriots.

After pulling out to an early 28-3 lead, Atlanta allowed the Patriots to reel off 25 consecutive points to tie the game and secure an overtime period (the first in Super Bowl history).

Although the Falcons outpaced the Patriots by nearly millions of fans, according to Nielsen ratings released late this evening, the Patriots pulled of an amazing comeback to win in overtime by a score of 34-28.

“We all brought each other back,” said quarterback Tom Brady, who was named Super Bowl M.V.P. for a record fourth time. “We never felt out of it.”

At the end, Brady completed 43 of 62 passes for 466 yards and two touchdowns.

For his part, Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan appeared unstoppable through the first three quarters with plenty of help from the Falcons defense.

The game became political after President Donald Trump chose to side with the Patriots setting off a firestorm of left wing hacks to back the Falcons in an Anti-American move to simply spite the President. The famed commercials aired during the game added to the sentiment of a large number of Americans unhappy with the direction taken by the Trump administration.

Trump, who is famously friendly with the team’s owner (Robert Kraft), coach (Bill Belichick) and quarterback (Tom Brady), gave up on his Super Bowl favorites after the team went down 28-3 in the second half and left his Trump International Golf Party in West Palm Beach, Florida. Trump would later tweet “What an amazing comeback and win by the Patriots. Tom Brady, Bob Kraft and Coach B are total winners. Wow.”

In response to the lose, liberals launched the hashtag #NotMyOvertime.

Punxsutawney, PA – The handlers of Pennsylvania’s most famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, said the furry whiskered rodent saw his shadow early Thursday morning, predicting four more years of insufferable snowflakes.

The top hat-wearing cult members of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club reveal Phil’s forecast every February 2nd, based on a German legend surrounding Candlemas.

Thousands gathered overnight on Gobbler’s Knob, a tiny hill just outside of town. Folk music and fireworks displays went on long into the night.

The groundhog’s prediction is typically contained in a short poem, often times based on current events. This year, Phil’s official decree touched on a subject on everyone’s mind, the newly elected 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.

“It’s mighty cold weather, you’ve been braving. Is it a peaceful future you are craving? The seer of seers says play your Trump card, be not intimidated by angry libtards,” the proclamation read. “Since you’ve been up all night and starting to shake, I see four more years of whiny, entitled snowflakes.”

As aficionados of the ritual will know, that means we’re in for at least four more years of protests, trigger warnings and safe spaces.

God help us all.

TRUMP TOWER – Soon after securing the Republican presidential nomination, business mogul/reality TV star Donald J. Trump swore off any and all assistance from the U.S. intelligence community, stating he did not trust the briefings he was set to receive as the nominee. “I won’t use them because they’ve made such bad decisions,” he said at the time.

The Washington Post recently reported that a team of intelligence analysts “has been prepared to deliver daily briefings on global developments and security threats to Trump in the two weeks since he won,” but he’s passed on all but two meetings. Offered daily access to sensitive and classified information from around the globe, the U.S.’s incoming leader — who has no governmental or military experience — simply declined, declaring he’d rather receive his daily briefings over his favorite social media platform, Twitter.

“I like Twitter because it trims off all the fat,” Trump told Fox News, “if you can’t get your point across in 140-characters or less, then it can’t be that important anyways.”

Trump’s team says the president-elect has been focused on the transition and selecting the members of his administration’s Cabinet and say he still has plenty of time to get up to speed on international affairs and security threats before he takes office.

The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, who is also a senior member of Trump’s transition team, told the Post that he is not concerned about Trump’s Twitter preference.

“National security is Donald Trump’s No. 1 priority and he’s taking it very seriously,” Nunes said. “Look how many leaders he’s met with, how many phone calls he’s taken, positions he’s filled. So what if he uses Twitter…he’s getting the job done.”

Mr. Trump has tweeted almost two dozen times in the last two days, including a barrage of multi-tweet criticisms of the press, a violent tweetstorm about the popular vote and possible fraud, and his latest proposal; to jail or revoke citizenship of people who burn the American flag.

NEW YORK, NEW YORK — President-Elect Donald J. Trump has already been raising eyebrows with his cabinet and adviser selections.

Trump tapped Jeff Sessions as his Attorney General when Sessions was deemed too racist for a federal judgeship back in the 1980’s. He’s asked Steve Bannon, an executive for Breitbart News, which frequently publishes white nationalist and white supremacist news under the banner of the “alt-right” movement, to be his Chief Strategist. This week he announced that South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley will be his U.N. ambassador despite having no experience in the State Department, and has reportedly asked Dr. Ben Carson — a chief rival during the Republican primaries — to be his Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

At a press conference late Tuesday night, Trump gave some insight into his thinking process in inviting Carson into the role of HUD secretary.

“Well, I mean, you know, he’s um, one of them, isn’t he,” Trump asked rhetorically.

Reporters asked Trump what he meant by “one of them.” The president-elect first just winked back at the reporters. When they didn’t understand what he meant, he tried touching his nose. Exasperated, Mr. Trump finally answered the question in his trademark way.

“Look, he’s one of them, you know what I mean,” Trump said, “you know, his people are into jazz and they have an extra muscle that makes them good sports.”

The press pool was still not quite sure what he meant. Trump tried again to explain to him why he was choosing Dr. Carson for his HUD secretaro.

“It’s got the word urban in it, right,” Trump asked, “and when we think of urban we think of people of a certain…type, right? You know they all smoke marihuana cigarrettes and their women are Jezebels, strong sexual appetites, know what I mean?”

Still, the reporters weren’t quite understanding what Mr. Trump was getting at. He dug in even further.

“C’mon people, follow me here,” Trump implored them, “the job has the word urban in it, he’s an urban. You know, an URBAN. Like, his people are incapable of self-care and sink into lunacy under the burden of freedom.”

Looking puzzled, members of the press pool still couldn’t quite understand what Trump’s meaning was. They pushed for more clarity. Growing ever more flustered, Mr. Trump tried to oblige.

“You know, he could be a minstrel,” Trump offered, “he’s a good song and dance man, get it? Like, he’s not going to go swimming any time soon, no matter how long ago he ate. Get it now? Huh?”

After fifteen more minutes of trying to get the reporters assembled there to understand him, Trump finally gave up. He dug into his pocket, and got out some black shoe polish. He also got out a large rag and started smearing the polish all over his face, except around his eyes and mouth, there he left his trademark orange skin intact. He began singing.

“Everything seems lovely when you start to roam,” Trump sang out, continuing, “The birds are singin’, the day that you stray. But wait until you are further away. Things won’t be so lovely when you’re all alone. Here’s what you’ll keep saying when you’re far from home. Mammy, Mammy. The sun shines east, the sun shines west. I know where the sun shines best.”

The media simply grew quiet, their jaws agape.

“Mammy, my little Mammy,” Trump forged on, “My heartstrings are tangled around Alabammy. I’m comin’, sorry that I made you wait. I’m comin’, hope and trust that I’m not late, oh oh.

Mammy, my little Mammy. I’d walk a million miles for one of your smiles. My Mammy, oh oh.”

No one knew what to do, or what to say. So they just kept taking notes as Trump sang on.

“Mammy, my little Mammy,” Mr. Trump bellowed forth, “The sun shines east, the sun shines west. I know where, I know where the sun shines best. It’s on my Mammy I’m talkin’ about, nobody else’s. My little Mammy. My heartstrings are tangled around Alabammy. Mammy, Mammy, I’m comin’. I, I hope I didn’t make you wait.”

Now, it seemed that trump was building a crescendo. He was clearly ready to bring it all home. The reporters still just watched in stunned amazement.

“Mammy, Mammy, I’m comin’,” Trump sang, “Oh God I, I hope I’m not late. Mammy look at me. Don’t you know me? I’m your little baby. I’d walk a million miles for one of your smiles

My Mammy!”

A report from NPR shows that Trump lost the popular vote by a margin of two million votes to Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — The days in President Barack Hussein Obama’s (D-Kenya) presidency are dwindling, and aides close to the first black president are saying he’s been thinking long and hard about what he’ll do once he leaves the White House. Some staffers this week told media outlets that one idea Obama has is to continue one of his most ambitious efforts as president but in the private sector. At an early morning press conference Wednesday morning, Obama made those intentions known to the public.





“You know,” Obama told reporters in the White House press briefing room, “once you get a taste for disarming the public; it’s really hard to quit.”

Obama told the media he is mulling over whether or not he should become a “private sector gun grabber” once he leaves and alleged billionaire Donald J. Trump is sworn-in next January. The move, he said, would fit “right in line” with his “obvious and apparent” presidential goals. He said that “every right-winger and Sean Hannity viewer knows” he’s been out to take away everyone’s guns as president, and at first he was “deeply saddened” by the prospect of not being able to do so anymore.

“What’s an anti-American puppet of George Soros supposed to do,” Obama asked, “if he can’t destroy America from within or at the very least confiscate every good, God-fearing, ammo-hoarding patriot’s weapons cache?”

Feeling a heavy malaise, Obama says he confided in outgoing Vice President Joe Biden that he was feeling “a lot of ennui” over not being able to confiscate Americans’ guns. That’s when Biden told him to consider making a transition to the private sector. After thinking about it over a long weekend golfing, which one right-wing news site estimated cost taxpayers approximate $2.3 trillion dollars a hole, Obama decided Biden was “dead on” and he’s begun putting together a non-government organization, or NGO, to do just that.

“I’ve seen what being a gun grabbing Kenyan socialist Sharia lover is like in the public sector,” Obama said, “and now I want to see if I can bring those same traits to the private sector.”

Obama’s group will be called Organizing For Confiscation, and it will be lead by Obama, George Soros, Hillary Clinton, Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg, former NBA player Mookie Blaylock, Beelzebub, and the ghost of Saul Alinsky. It will focus first, Obama said, on training Obama in the ways of the ninja. That way, the president said, he can “more easily sneak into people’s homes and grab those guns.”

“Let’s be very clear here,” Obama told reporters, “despite my best efforts, I was not successful in confiscating nearly as many guns as I had hoped. Frankly, I don’t think I grabbed very many at all. I was just never able to get away with it, but I would have it if weren’t for those darned, snooping right-wing conspiracy theorists. OFC will take my mission to disarm America so that the commie invasion can begin and run with it full steam, or I’ll hand in my Sharia Socialism card.”

The NRA could not be reached for comment.

President Donald Trump seems to be losing his battle with CNN. Although Trump has branded CNN, and other mainstream outlets “fake media,” a recent poll showed that CNN was more trusted than the president.

According to an Axios poll, 50 percent of adults trust CNN over Trump, who 43 percent said they trusted. However, the same poll indicated that 89 percent of Republicans said Trump was “trustworthy.”

The Business Standard News recently asked Americans if they trusted Trump. The answers were scathing.

“I’d rather have rather hit Bristol Palin raw, than trust Trump,” said Leroy Williams, a resident of Atlanta, who responded via email.

John Spencer of Austin, Texas also didn’t trust Trump.

“I’d rather give my 401K to Bernie Madoff than trust Trump,” said Spencer.

Several Evangelical Christians have defended President Donald Trump’s war against the media. Trump has caught flak for attacking MSNBC hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski and CNN on Twitter.

“Trump is God’s instrument on Earth and the gay-friendly liberal media is naturally against him,” said televangelist Jim Bakker on his television show. “The liberal media helped promote gay marriage and they’re against everything Christianity stands for.”

Jerry Falwell Jr., son of Jerry Falwell Sr., founder of the Moral Majority, also came to Trump’s defense, according to the Hill.

“The left is melting down,” Jerry Falwell Jr., in a FOX News interview. “It’s incredible to watch how they still haven’t gotten over how Donald Trump won and when he hits them back on Twitter, I actually appreciate that.”

Trump was also supported by Robert Jeffress, pastor of First Baptist Church, who recently held a patriotic rally for the president in Dallas.

Jeffress claimed Trump was defending the religious freedom of all faiths. However, since his election hate crimes against Muslims have skyrocketed. Trump has also attempted to institute a ban on immigration from certain Muslim countries and the White House also recently failed to hold an Iftar dinner to celebrate the end of Ramadan. According to CNN, this is the first time this has happened in 20 years.

While most of sane America was horrified by President Donald Trump’s latest tweet, which shows him literally body-slamming CNN, some Republicans are cheering him on.

According to right-wing commentator Michael Savage, the press is attacking Trump because they don’t know how to deal with his “masculine energy.”

“Look, most of the fake media are limp-wristed, latte-drinking fags,” said Savage on his show, “The Savage Nation.” “The reason why they’re trying to destroy Trump is they’re jealous of testosterone levels. They don’t know how to handle an alpha male.”

Savage was fired from MSNBC for insulting a gay caller.

Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson also praised Trump’s take-no-prisoners attitude in a World Net Daily column. He urged Trump to keep tweeting.

Peterson also said, “I love the example that President Trump sets for America. Finally, there’s a real man in office! He breaks the culture that kills masculinity and distorts truth. He shows tough love with no fear. Americans have not seen such a man in so long that many do not recognize it.”

President Donald Trump seems to be hit with a new scandal every week. According to MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, Trump engineered a spat with Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski to draw attention away from the deepening Russian scandal. But Trump still has his staunch supporters.

The National White Alliance, a white nationalist organization, has praised Trump for restoring dignity to the White House.

“I thank God that we now have a president that the majority of the country can be proud of,” said Brian Blanc, president of the National White Alliance, in a press release. “Obama’s presidency was an eight-year nightmare. He ruined our international reputation and made us look weak.”

Fox News host Tucker Carlson also chided the left for their criticism of Trump.

“Let’s be totally clear about this and not lie about it,” said Carlson. “The left doesn’t hate Trump because he’s vulgar, though he is. … They applauded when Barack Obama vacationed with rappers. … No, they hate Trump because he’s a nationalist who says the interests of America and its people ought to come first, and that’s fine.”

Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has come to the defense of President Donald Trump after he made sexist comments about MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski. Trump accused her of trying to get into his Florida resort after she was bleeding from the face due to plastic surgery.

…to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year's Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 29, 2017

The president’s comments have been condemned by people on the left and the right of the political spectrum, but not Jones.

Jones claimed Trump was trying to alert the public about the shape-shifting reptilian aliens, who have infiltrated the mainstream media

“The shape shifters have infiltrated the fake media and they are using that to carry out their war against Trump,” said Jones, who counts himself as a close confidant of the president’s. “Mika wasn’t bleeding from plastic surgery, she had just finished transforming into human form and had some complications.”

Jones also recently claimed the children who died in the Sandy Hook shooting could be living as slaves on a Martian space colony.

According to Media Matters, Jones wasn’t alone in his support of Trump. Several other Republicans backed his comments.

Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump “isn’t going to be somebody who’s bullied and allows people, himself, and those around him to be personally attacked.”

FOX News commentator Sean Hannity also tweeted his support.

Maybe liberal Joe should stop calling the @POTUS a schmuck, a liar, a thug and mentally unhinged. Were they kissing @POTUS ass at xmas? Yes https://t.co/Ehf4EHvcjS — Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) June 29, 2017

Right-wing commentator Rev. Jesse Lee Paterson has found something else to blame on former President Barack Obama: the opioid epidemic.

In an interview with WEHW radio, Peterson said Obama’s disastrous policies caused many white people to turn to drugs.

“Obama created so much chaos and havoc that it caused a lot of white people to freak out and turn to drugs,” said Peterson. “He was a black man in a position that was normally meant for white men. That was too much for many of them to handle.”

Peterson isn’t the only right-winger to have a ludicrous theory for the opioid crisis ravaging the Mid-West. Brian Kilmeade, one of the hosts of “FOX and Friends,” suggested building a wall on the Mexican would solve the opioid drug crisis.

“What do you think the wall would do to stop this opioid crisis. Of course, there’s no quick fix. But this would fix a lot,” said Kilmeade, in an interview with Printus LeBlanc.

However, users of opioid drugs like Oxycontin, were given the drugs by doctors. The drugs were also manufactured legally by pharmaceutical companies, not smuggled across the Mexican border. Some states and cities have filed lawsuits against pharma companies who they accuse of dumping prescription drugs in their communities.

Pat Robertson predicts President Donald Trump will be as successful as conservative icon President Ronald Reagan.

“Trump has been in office for about six months and he has already seen tremendous success,” said Robertson on “The 700 Club.” “Reagan ended the Cold War, and I predict Trump will end the War on Terror.”

Robertson is not alone in his deluded enthusiasm for Trump. Eric Trump appeared on FOX News in a softball interview with Maria Baritromo and bragged about his father’s accomplishments.

“He’s been in office 150-something days, and I think he has accomplished more than any president arguably in history has over that same period of time,” said Eric Trump.

He also claimed Obamacare was failing and called the head of the DNC a “nut job.” But Trump has yet to pass any major legislation and hundreds of federal positions remain unfilled.

Ivanka Trump, a special adviser to the president, recently gave her father an A rating.

The National White Alliance, a white nationalist organization, has come out against BET, which recently held its star-studded awards show in Los Angeles. The show featured artists such as Chris Brown, Migos and Jamie Foxx.

“How come BET has its own channel and their own award ceremony?” said National White Alliance President Brian Blanc. “You couldn’t have an all-white channel, or a predominately white award ceremony.”

President Donald Trump also complained about the BET Awards last year saying, “Whites don’t get any nominations.”

However, BET regularly features non-black artists such as Bruno Mars and Robin Thicke. (Mars won this year’s Best male R&B/pop award.)

Also, the Oscars have regularly featured award ceremonies where few, if any, black actors were nominated. And the Country Music Awards (CMA) was hit with complaints when Beyonce was nominated for an award.

President Donald Trump, who based his campaign on appealing to white fears, has had trouble trying to repair relations with the black community.

Several news reports stated that the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) recently refused to meet him for the second time.

“I fail to see how a social gathering would benefit the policies we advocate for,” said Rep. Cedric Richmond, president of the CBC.

The Business Standard News reached out to some Capitol Hill staffers to discuss how members of the CBC really feel about Trump.

“I’d rather invite David Duke to a black picnic in Compton, than appear in a photo op with Trump,” said one CBC member, who asked to remain anonymous.

Another member, who also preferred not to use his name, was equally as scathing.

“I’d rather go to a Confederate Civil War reenactment than go to the Trump White House,” said the congressman, who comes from the South

Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has weighed in on the recent Bill Cosby rape trial. The case was declared a mistrial, but Jones smelled a conspiracy behind it.

“Cosby is a member of the Illuminati and he probably had his buddies call in some favors,” said Jones on his show “InfoWars.” “I also have a source who says some of the jurors were replaced by shape-shifting aliens who voted in Cosby’s favor.”

Jones is still dealing with the aftermath of his NBC interview with Megyn Kelly. Kelly took him to task for his conspiratorial views, such as suggesting the Sandy Hook school shooting was a false flag operation staged by the government. Jones’ ex-wife Kelly said the interview made him look like a “moron,” according to the Huffington Post.

“He’s a fraud and a fake and I really think Megyn Kelly really showed that,” said Kelly Jones, according to “Inside Edition.” “She did a fantastic job of showing who Alex is and the hypocrite he is and the influence he has.”

Alex Jones recently lost custody of his children to his ex-wife.

Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has joined the ranks of other right-wing commentators in raining condemnation down on the left after the recent Capitol Hill baseball shooting.

Jones said all liberals should swear loyalty to Donald Trump or be stripped of their citizenship.

“I’m tired of all this hateful, dangerous rhetoric,” said Jones on his show “InfoWars.” “These people are either loyal to Trump or they’re against us.”

Jones recently appeared as a guest on Megyn Kelly’s poorly-rated NBC show. (The show drew lower ratings than a rerun of “60 Minutes.”) His appearance caused companies like J.P. Morgan Chase to pull their ads.

However, Jones isn’t the only right-wing commentator to have a hysterical reaction to James T. Hodgkinson’s terrorist attack.

Erick Erickson, founder of Red State, said he’d given up on the United States. He also called the left “American ISIS.”

“The only escape is dissolution,” said Erickson on the web site The Resurgent. “We should part ways if we cannot have federalism. We should start talking about secession. If both sides have decided that every hill is a hill to die on and control of Washington means reward for their friends and punishment of their enemies, we need to end Washington. The way to do that is end the union.”

Right-wing radio show host Michael Savage has joined several other members of the conservative media in blaming the recent shooting of several Republican congressmen on the left.

In fact, Savage called on right-wing militia, such as the Oath Keepers, to take out “left-wing traitors” before they do further damage.

“The left are traitorous, commie scum who are allied with Russia, not Trump who is trying to fight against the Russians,” said Savage on his show “The Savage Nation.”

According to Media Matters, Savage, who is Jewish, recently cited a map from American Renaissance, a white nationalist organization, to claim Trump supporters have faced “200 acts of violence” since he declared his candidacy.

In other news, end times preacher Rick Wiles called for the entire left-wing to be abolished, according to Right Wing Watch.

“Quite frankly, the Democratic Party should be disbanded as a violent, seditious political movement,” said Wiles

Wiles also went after the “liberal media.”

“Rachel Maddow ought to be taken off the air right now,” he said. “MSNBC should be shut down.”

Conservative commentator Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson has condemned the “demonic fake media” for attacking President Donald Trump.

“Trump was put in the White House by God,” said Peterson on his radio show. “If the media attacks Trump, they attack God. And when you attack God, anything could happen. They could be hit by lightning of stricken by plagues. They need to stop.”

Peterson also dismissed most of the media as “dykes and sissies.” Peterson is infamous for his bizarre views. He once said that America started going downhill when women got the right to vote. More recently he praised Trump’s boorish behavior at the NATO summit and chanted “white power, white power.”

Even though Trump received millions of dollars in free media when he was running for president, he has continued to complain about media coverage.

“The Fake News Media has never been so wrong or so dirty,” said Trump in a Twitter post. “Purposely incorrect stories and phony sources to meet their agenda of hate. Sad!”

Radio show Alex Jones has come to the defense of Eric Trump who recently made inflammatory comments about Democrats.

In an interview on FOX News, Eric Trump said Democrats “were not even people.”

However, Jones said Eric Trump was trying to send a message about how reptilian shape-shifting aliens have infiltrated the Democratic Party.

“The reptilians have taken over the Democratic Party,” said Jones on his show “InfoWars.” “I have received reports that DNC headquarters receives regular supplies of live rodents, which the reptilians feast on.”

Jones is a notorious conspiracy theorist famous for his outlandish claims. During the 2016 presidential election, he accused Hillary Clinton of smelling like rotten meat, being part of a pedophile ring and chopping up the bodies of children. Jones had to issue an apology after one of his listeners shot up a Washington, D.C. pizzeria in a botched attempt to free imprisoned children.

Eric Trump, who also accused Democrats of being immoral, is facing his own scandal. Forbes recently revealed he funneled donations for to a children’s cancer charity to the Trump organization.

Conservative commentator Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson has predicted President Donald Trump will have a successful stint as chief of state, simply because he is white.

“I’m so thankful Trump is president and we have a white man back in charge,” said Peterson on his radio show. “When Obama was president there was a black cloud over the country. Black people simply can’t run a country. It’s like a curse.”

Peterson seems to be referring to an old racist belief that black people suffer from “the curse of Ham.” He isn’t the only black conservative to share these views. Pastor David James Manning posted a sermon on YouTube, where he claimed that “black people couldn’t do anything.” He also said Egypt wasn’t in Africa.

According to Right Wing Watch, Peterson recently praised Trump’s uncouth behavior during his recent European trip.

“He goes overseas and those little weak ones try to get in front of him during a photo shoot, he pushed them out of the way,” said Peterson. “White power. White power! I’m loving it. I love good. I love the light and it doesn’t matter the color of the person that the light is coming from, I love it. I rejoice when I see men and women stand up with the love of God operating through them, overcoming evil.”

Far right commentator Michael Savage has joined the string of conservative pundits cheering the assault of Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs. Jacobs was trying to ask Montana congressional candidate Greg Gianforte a question when he was choked and slammed to the ground.

Savage said reporters deserve even worse.

“Reporters deserve to have their pants pulled down and f**ked in the ass. They’d probably like it,” said Savage on his show “The Savage Nation.” “The liberal media are absolute low-life scum.”

President Donald Trump has also been attacking the media for more than a year and branded them “the enemy of the people.”

Despite being charged with a misdemeanor, Gianforte still won his race. Even worse, right-wing pundits have supported him and denigrated Jacobs.

Radio show host Rush Limbaugh salivated over Gianforte instead of condemning his actions.

“Gianforte, the manly and studly candidate, threw the 125-pound wet dishrag reporter from The Guardian to the ground,” said Limbaugh.

FOX News commentator Rachel Campos-Duffy also praised Gianforte’s violent act describing it as “Montana justice.”

Televangelist Paula White, a close confidant of President Donald Trump, is capitalizing on their friendship. White, a notorious proponent of the prosperity gospel, is now hawking “prayer flags,” for $100 a piece.

“These flags will enhance your prayer request, since they have been prayed over by both the president and I,” said White in a message on her website.

Many Christian theologians consider the thrice-married White a heretic and dismiss the prosperity gospel, which says God wants Christians to be wealthy on Earth, as a misinterpretation of Christianity.

According to Heat Street, Hector Gomez, a pastor who worked with White at the Without Walls ministry, said the female evangelist used to steal from her congregants.

“‘People would give them jewelry, diamonds, watches,’ Gomez said. One day, he said, he watched in horror as Paula White sifted through the collection plate after church, picking out the jewelry that looked valuable,” said the Heat Street article.

White’s career as a minister has been marked by scandals involving divorces, bankruptcies and lavish spending on luxury cars and private jets.

Many years ago, one was restricted to only a handful of TV channels. You watched what show was coming up next on the schedule. There wasn’t a great deal of choice. There was no movie streaming, no DVD, no VCR. Your choices were limited.

Royalty Free Photo

Technology, whether through high-speed internet service or the digitization of media content, has changed how we consume content forever. The handful of TV channels turned into hundreds, streaming media opened up the world of entertainment, and sites like YouTube and Netflix altered the viewing habits of consumers of media content.

Here are a few of the ways that technology is changing TV viewing habits.

Social Viewing

When TV networks and cable channels discovered that enthusiastic viewers were tweeting and talking online about their favorite show while watching them, an opportunity was seized to make this more interactive. An executive producer like Michael Palance, who is involved with the “My Hollywood” reality series, could live tweet about his experience of helping make the series. Michael David Palance might also share behind the scenes photos on-set too.

The advent of social viewing has allowed actors, producers, and other people to participate with the audience, in real-time, in a way never possible before. A whole new conversation develops between viewers and producers of the show when each plot twist is revealed. It makes it more fun and interactive.

Binge Watching

Before steaming services, unless recording an entire TV season on TiVo and then enjoying the episodes in quick succession, we were stuck with watching one episode at a time. Networks drip fed the episodes over 10-25 weeks, depending on the length of the season. If you wanted to watch your favorite show faster, you couldn’t.

With streaming movies and TV, it’s possible for providers like Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Netflix to release an entire season of a popular show on the same day. Avid fans are then able to watch as many episodes of that season of their favorite show as they can squeeze into the day. Many people are now binge watching several episodes back-to-back, unable to get enough. Sometimes this is just because they love what they’re seeing, but other times it’s because they’ve only just learned about the show and are trying to catch up to the current season.

Resurrecting Canceled TV Shows

A new phenomenon is streaming services either creating their own TV series or resurrecting earlier ones that were canceled too soon due to declining ratings.

Netflix resurrected Arrested Development (a FOX drama) and The Killing (an AMC drama) to produce a new season, completing the story for viewers who felt short-changed. Given that a business such as Netflix is not tied to advertiser revenue to fund continued TV show development (they use a subscription-based model), this gives them more options.

Several streaming providers made pilots and let the viewers decide which ones to make into a full season. Amazon Prime is one example of this, creating their own pilot season separate to the TV networks and letting viewers decide.

The rapidly changing technology is exciting because it’s bringing canceled TV shows back to life, letting fans watch more of the shows they love and gets them inside the creative forces behind their favorite shows. How will TV evolve over the next decade? Only time will tell.

There are different ways create more light and make rooms brighter when the walls are too dark or there is limited access to natural light. Factors such as personal preferences, the number of changes you want to make and budget will influence the steps you take in this type of process.

You can brighten rooms with additional lighting, accessories and furniture. A brighter room will ultimately feel more open, inviting and airy. Decorate a dark room by emphasizing on color, light and furniture placement.

Curtains

Removing dark curtains or swapping them for brighter ones will have an instant effect on the darkness of the space. Making a few minor changes will allow more light into the room. Get rid of any obstructions and take down any curtains that limit the amount of light coming in. Replace dark blinds with lighter ones and keep them open to bring more natural light in.

Light Fixtures

A simple and effective way to brighten your space is light fixtures. Install light fixtures and place them appropriately to tone down dark walls and create a vibrant feel. Focus on the darkest parts of the room and add lights in such areas.

Electricians can recommend various lighting solutions that will help you adjust the amount of light according to your needs. If there are parts of your home that are particularly dark, consider focusing light on accent walls in the rooms. Direct more light towards dark areas or place lights next to the accent walls.

Furniture

The way you arrange furniture can determine how open and spacious the room feels. Furniture plays a major role in the overall appearance of a room. Furniture that has been placed near a dark wall should be moved away.

Ensure that each room has an open entry way without any obstructions. People should be able to enter rooms without being blocked by couches and tables.

Avoid clustering furniture pieces in one area of the space.

If your furniture is dark, think about exchanging it for lighter options. Lighter furniture will have the effect of minimizing darkness while creating a brighter look. If you are not ready to buy new pieces or do not want to swap your furniture, you make small adjustments such as lighter covers for your couches, bright pillows and light colored cushions.

It is also a good idea to remove some of the furnishing from your space to open it up and enhance the free, flowing feel of the room. Limit the number of furniture pieces that are next to walls and try to keep sections of your walls clear. Keep darker furniture away from areas of the room that are not sufficiently lit.

Accessories

Get rid of dark accessories that intensify the lack of light in the room. This is a worthwhile step towards brightening your home.

Replace accessories that feature dark colors with lighter varieties. Brighten your rooms with light and boldly colored rugs.

Remove clutter and any unnecessary objects that are filling up the space to create an illusion of a larger and spacious place. This helps to make the room look brighter and lighter.

It requires complete and undivided attention in landscaping by trained experts and professionals to create a beautiful landscape lined with healthy trees and shrubs. Taking proper care of trees and shrubs is not easy, and one must have proper knowledge and training to accomplish the task successfully.

Essay writing is something which is becoming more and more ubiquitous within the educational system as time goes on, students may find themselves with not enough time to complete all their work simply because the time they need to dedicate to the research and writing of one particular subject. This is where websites come in, websites which cover all aspects of the writing process, from completing the entire process on their own with minimal assistance from the client, to sites which are simply useful in the way they are set up.

Essaybasics.com

This site offers essay writing help in a variety of ways: the most prominent one is of course the custom essay service, where writers and editors take an essay order and produce an entirely new essay based on the information provided by the client. The client can be as involved in this process as they like, from not providing anything other than basic information, to giving a detailed background on what they want in their essay and where. Sample essays are slightly different in that they come pre-written, the client simply asks for an essay of a specific length and subject, and is given an essay in return. While the sample essays are themselves only with a fixed amount, the custom essays necessarily vary in their prices according to length and complexity. The site itself offers a variety of discounts for returning users, with three papers getting five percent, seven papers getting ten percent, and ten papers getting fifteen percent off the total cost. New users also get a fifteen percent discount. It is important to note that while the normal price per page for the site is $12.93, if a client is asking for a rush job, the price will be higher.

The site offers custom essay clients a huge variety in what they can ask for – they can ask for essays from a variety of educational levels, and their choice of subject is only limited by what the site itself can provide. The number of pages and whether it is to be single or double spaced can be chosen as well.

As well as the custom essay area and the sample essay area, essaybasics.com offers essay writing help in the form of a blog and writing help. These two sections are not explicitly associated with the custom writing services, but nevertheless they are on the same site. The blog covers a number of different of different subjects when it comes to writing and research, allowing people to look for a blog post which suits their needs more exactly. These blog posts do include samples, but they are not the same as the ones which are available to buy, for obvious reasons. The writing help page features tutorials on how to cite properly using a variety of formats, and how to properly format an essay.

Readable.io

This site offers essay writing help after the essay has been written by allowing people to check how easy to read their writing actually is. The site itself offers several different sections depending on what type of writing a client needs to check, from files to online text to URLs. The writing itself is given an overall rating on readability, but the site goes further than that by individually marking up what it sees as complicating the readability process, and giving explanations as to why it should be different.

Turnitin.com

Turnitin.com is a form of essay writing help which helps to check for plagiarism. It can sometimes be useful to check for plagiarism, particularly since when using online sources it can be difficult to avoid the issue sometimes. Turnitin.com is normally seen as the province of teachers and lecturers as they check to see that their students have done the work themselves, rather than simply lifting bits of it wholesale from other sources. These sites are useful for students as well, as they show where plagiarism has happened, and also show where people have simply forgotten to properly cite their essay references.

Essays are very complex, because they not only involve the writing process, but also involve the research and formatting processes. Because of this, the internet has provided a number of sites to help with various parts of the process. The sites themselves vary from complete works, to simple add-ons for the end results, giving people a huge range from which to work as they move through their education as a whole, and through the process of writing an essay in particular. Using sites to help with the entire process (to whichever degree that particular student thinks is necessary), can free up extra time to learn the quirks that every teacher seems to have when it comes to marking and grading essays.

There will always be that one annoying pain that will come at a random time in a person’s everyday business, knowing the causes of such will help you in the cure and prevention. With the everyday use of computers and smartphones, one particular pain is always waiting on the fray, neck pain.

Neck pain is associated with several things and how such pain occurs is not that hard to decipher. These factors vary from the slightest reason to more complicated reasons such as neck pain being one of the symptoms of meningismus. Of course, this could other things, but being informed is better than being sorry.

Too Much Work

If you happen to spend countless hours looking at your computer screen because you have some important work to do, then you will realize that at some random time during your work you will feel an annoying sensation in your neck. You will tend to hold on to it for quite some time and try to massage it thinking that it might go away. But that’s not the case, if it’s there, then it’s either you go and get some rest or just go and manage work with it.

What causes this is stress that leads to muscle strain and worn out joints. These are the common reasons for neck pain. If you overuse your capacity to do work and forget that your body also has some breaking point, then you will begin to feel the effects of tiredness. In light of this, you should consider taking a short break.

Poor Posture

Slouching is really a drag because it leads to problems at the end of the day. It is better to see a person sitting up straight or a well-arranged posture standing up, but sometimes the weight of your body is too heavy to actually give too much care about it the first place. This one misconception that people will think that it’s trying to get a posture because to them it’s just “posture”. The truth? It is quite the challenge to get that correct posture because it will take time in getting used to by sitting, standing and walking.

Poor posture is associated with neck pain because your neck is what supports your head and the moment you keep on slouching your backbone that supports your back is also affected in a way that it leads up to your neck because of poor posture and with that such problem occur.

You do not need to become a doctor to give a care about your own health, but if you need to seek more advanced assistance then it would a great idea visiting your nearest clinic or hospital. It would also be a great idea in knowing your body’s massage points that if ever you are dumb enough to forget about on why you should be staying away from things that will give you a hard time, you can give yourself the self-service you deserve in order to give you a more refreshing start to your day or a boost in your work. To consider oneself well is all it takes.

Should you worry about having neck pain is not a decision but rather a responsibility; if it constantly occurs because of your working environment and habit then you have to change something because it will affect your health and give you a hard time in continuing your day-to-day activities. Becoming aware with the smaller things that occur would give you tons of ways to stop more complicated things happening to your health.

UPDATE: THIS WORKED, GIVING DONALD TRUMP THE PRESIDENCY

COLUMBUS, OH (AP) — History was made today in Columbus, Ohio when more than 3 million Amish poured into the city to see the American Amish Brotherhood (AAB), an organization which acts as an informal governing body for the Amish community, endorse Donald Trump for president. That number represents a significant portion of the total Amish population, which the United States Census Bureau says numbers more than 20 million men and women nationwide all pledging their vote to Trump for President. With the full force of the Amish community behind him, Donald Trump is now mathematically guaranteed to win the presidency in November.







The organization typically meets once a year and the meetings usually consist of about 300 Amish leaders who meet to discuss the challenges, such as urban sprawl, that face the community. This year, however, the organization wanted as many people in attendance as possible so they can effectively instruct all Amish men and women of legal voting age to cast their vote for the flamboyant Republican nominee.

The Amish, who are direct descendants of the protestant reformation sect known as the Anabaptists, have typically stayed out of politics in the past. As a general rule, they don’t vote, serve in the military, or engage in any other displays of patriotism. This year, however, the AAB has said that it is imperative that they get involved in the democratic process.

“Over the past eight years, the Democratic Party has launched a systematic assault on biblical virtues,” said AAB Chairman Elijah Fisher. “We have seen more and more Christians being persecuted for their faith; we have seen the state defile the institution of marriage allowing the homogays to come together just like normal people. And now, they want to put a woman in the nation’s highest leadership role in direct violation of my favorite Bible passage, 1 Timothy 2:12, ‘I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet’.” Fisher continued, “We need to stop this assault on God and take a stand for biblical principles. Donald Trump has shown in both action and deed that he is committed to restoring this country to the Lord’s way.”

According to statistician Nate Silver of the website fivethirtyeight.com, there are no possible scenarios in which Hillary Clinton can win with Donald Trump carrying the Amish vote.

“The Amish have their highest numbers in perennial swing states like Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa,” Silver noted. “They also have strong numbers in reliably Democratic states like Michigan, Illinois, and New York, meaning that Hillary will lose those states as well. There is also a sizeable community in Florida which, while not as large as it is in the Midwest, is still large enough to turn Florida for Trump. Over the next two weeks, you can expect Hillary to enter into a state of freefall in all of my predictive models.”

37-year-old Paul Horner, a self-proclaimed “Donald Trump supporter since day one” told Leilani Hernandez, a reporter with local Columbus news station WBNS-10TV he is thrilled that Trump will be the next President.

“This is such great news, a Trump victory, I knew it would happen, I have been praying for it night and day,” Horner said. “Plus I work November 8th and it was going to be tough for me to get off work and vote because my boss is not the nicest of people. But now thanks to the great Amish people of this country, they have this thing locked up for a Donald Trump victory against crooked Hillary and I won’t have to miss work! God is good!”

The Clinton campaign issued a written statement to the AAB asking them to reconsider their decision.







“I don’t believe that Donald Trump is the person who best represents your interests,” Clinton wrote to the AAB. “As a career real estate developer, he represents a clear threat to your simple way of life. As former first lady of Arkansas, I understand the concerns of rural Americans more than any candidate in this election. I implore you to consider all of the facts before voting for my opponent.”

Most pundits believe that Mrs. Clinton’s plea is too little too late.

During a press conference in Manhattan early this morning, Trump thanked the AAB for their support and promised to put the Amish to work maintaining government buildings, which he said would save taxpayers millions because “the Amish do great work, the best work, for a very low price.”

Though Clinton has pledged to stay in the race until the very end, many of her campaign workers have already resigned. According to the Associated Press, it is expected that the Clinton campaign will lose 50% of its staff within the next week. There is a general mood of hopelessness and despair in the Clinton camp, and many simply want to cut their losses.

“It looked like she was going to win this election easily,” said Tom Downey, a campaign manager in Ohio, “But this is what happens when you wake a sleeping giant. Clearly, Mrs. Clinton took far too much for granted in this race, and we are all now paying the price. It’s really sad to see the campaign end this way.”

The AAB chooses weekly charities for those wishing to support what they do. The AAB’s charity for the week of November 4th is Sock It Forward, a charity that provides the homeless with brand new socks . If you are interested in learning more about the Amish community and the AAB, you can contact the Pennsylvania Amish Heritage Museum at (785) 273-0325.

WASHINGTON — Just two days after the funeral for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last week of a heart attack at the age of 79, President Obama signed Executive Order 14651, which appoints Rashad Hussain as the new Supreme Court Justice to replace Scalia.

“We cannot wait for a new President or the Senate Republicans to fill this vacancy left by Scalia, so I have taken it upon myself to do what needed to be done,” Obama told reporters at a press conference today. “Republican Senators believe that it is appropriate not to act on such an important matter, and as I have shown today, I do not agree with that.”

Hussain, of Muslim heritage, is an attorney who has served as US Special Envoy to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the second largest intergovernmental body after the UN, and as US Special Envoy for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications. Hussain has also served in the White House Counsel’s Office and on the National Security Council as a political appointee of the Obama Administration.







Even though under the Constitution, it is the President’s job to nominate Supreme Court justices, Obama’s selection is already drawing sharp criticism from Republicans. Presidential hopeful Donald Trump told ABC News that he does not agree with the President’s decision.”

“Hussain is a Muslim and a sympathizer, just like Obama, and now he takes over the legacy the great Antonin Scalia left behind. The President should be ashamed of himself.”

“The American people should have had a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said. “Appointing a Muslim to replace Scalia is absolutely appalling.”

Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward , a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she fully supports Obama’s decision.

“We needed someone in there to fill that spot as quickly as possible,” Bradley said. “Regardless if you agree with Obama’s appointed choice of Hussain, Scalia was a disgrace to the Supreme Court. He was a religious radical, a bigot, a racist, against women’s rights, gay rights and human rights in general; there’s absolutely no reason a person like that should have ever had power like that in the first place. He will always be remembered as being on the wrong side of history.”

David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes, a website that takes the fun out of stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, who is also currently being sued by Fox News for calling them a “fake news site”, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.

“This type of story, when it goes viral, and we debunk it, we make money,” Mikkelson said. “We use our cookie-cutter outlines, we copy and paste the original article into ours, type in one or two sentences of original content and then we make hella cash. If it wasn’t for people like Internet news satirist Paul Horner, my children wouldn’t have been able to go to college.”

Legal experts believe Republicans will attempt to block Obama’s appointee until he’s out of office, leaving the court with a gaping vacant seat for nearly a year.

“Obama has a right to do what he did, but we’ll fight him to the end on this,” Tom Downey of the Republican National Lawyers Association told reporters. “This will not stand, ya know, this aggression will not stand, man.”

And when we woke up, we had these bodies. They’re like, except I’m having them! Oh, I think we should just stay friends. You’ll have all the Slurm you can drink when you’re partying with Slurms McKenzie Hey, tell me something. You’ve got all this money. How come you always dress like you’re doing your laundry?

PHOENIX A.Z. (AP) — For months now, rumors have circulated the Internet that individuals were being paid to protest at rallies held by presidential hopeful Donald Trump. Today a man from Trump’s rally in Fountain Hills, Arizona back in March has come forward to say that he was paid to protest the event.

“I was given $3,500 to protest Donald Trump’s rally in Fountain Hills,” said 38-year-old Paul Horner. “I answered a Craigslist ad about a group needing actors for a political event. I interviewed with them and got the part.”

Trump supporters have been claiming that protesters are being paid by the Bernie Sanders’ campaign, but Horner disagrees.

“As for who these people were affiliated with that interviewed me, my guess would be Hillary Clinton’s campaign,” Horner said. “The actual check I received after I was done with the job was from a group called ‘Women Are The Future’. After I was hired, they told me if anyone asked any questions about who I was with or communicated with me in any way, I should start talking about how great Bernie Sanders is.” Horner continued, “It was mostly women in their 60’s at the interview that I went to. Plus, all the people that I communicated with had an AOL email address. No one still has an AOL email address except people that would vote for Hillary Clinton.”

“I knew those weren’t real protesters, they were too organized and smart,” said 59-year-old Tom Downey, a Trump supporter who attended the rally in Fountain Hills. “I knew there was something up when they started shouting all these facts and nonsense like that. The best we could do was just yell and punch em’ and stuff.” Downey continued, “I think we did a good job though. I was shouting at them the whole time, calling them losers, telling them to get a job or go back home to mommy’s house; I got a bunch of high-fives from my fellow Trump supporters. It was a great time.”

When asked about the other protesters at the rally, Horner said he saw most of them during the interview and training for the rally.

“Almost all of the people I was protesting with I had seen at my interview and training class. At the rally, talking with some of them, I learned they only paid Latinos $500, Muslims $600 and African Americans $750. I don’t think they were looking for any Asians. Women and children were paid half of what the men got and illegals received $300 across the board. I think I was paid more than the other protesters because I was white and had taken classes in street fighting and boxing a few years back”

Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she does not understand why Trump protesters would need to be paid.

“I’ll protest that guy for free,” Bradley said. “Trump is creating a place for like-minded, ignorant, bigoted, hate-filled individuals to gather and unite. You wouldn’t have to pay me anything to protest that.” Bradley continued, “Trump supporters are the last kind of people to donate socks to the homeless, they only care about themselves and their white race. I would love the day I ever see a donation from a Trump supporter, I think it would make me change my opinion about them.”

Horner said the group had a mandatory six-hour training class that had to be completed before protesting at Trump’s rally.

“During training we were taught chants to shout like ‘Dump Trump’ and ‘Trump Is A Racist’, things like that. We were told how to respond to anti-Trump comments too. If a Trump supporter said something about how great his wall will be, the Latinos in our group would say, ‘We’re just going to tunnel underneath it.’ They even gave me a shirt to wear at the rally which said ‘F*ck Donald Trump’ along with a sign to hold that said ‘Make America White Again’.”

David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.

“You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the Silverback gorilla my wife Barbara always wanted since she was a child,” Mikkleson said. “We claim ‘to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well‘, but that’s just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and that’s it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and I’m only telling you this for legal reasons. For example, do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its tax-exempt status? Did you actually read our story? Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax? What is the actual website URL? We claim to know it, but no real information is posted by us.” Mikkelson continues, “It is common for us to rewrite a story we’re debunking if we don’t like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a person’s name from the original article and then called him a liar, oh the hypocrisy, but it is so funny at the same time! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search that locates the actual article will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money,” Mikkelson laughs. “And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Plus, I know for our writers like Kim LaCapria, it is way more fun for them to cause controversy than report the facts; it results in more visitors. Kim LaCapria and Jeff Zarronandia go as far as accusing the site that the story originated from as ‘a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false “news” stories‘. The thing that is troubling about these claims and what Snopes and our authors are known for. We don’t list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up our claims; It’s just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work? To be honest, I’d say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real, actual, work.”

ABC News reached out to Hillary Clinton’s campaign for comment but did not receive a response. At the time of this posting, ads for the group were caring disclaimers which read, “At this time we are not accepting application for Muslims or persons who look of Middle Eastern descent.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — Following the results of Tuesday night’s election, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13805, which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December 19th. Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day, too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted, equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically.

“People all over the country have been flooding my office with calls, telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers,” Obama told reporters. “Many have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a Hillary Clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as President. This was especially bad in areas of Florida and North Carolina where there are high numbers of Latino and African American voters. We must investigate these claims. The margin of victory is too close to call, and the outcome of this election is too important. There is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for Trump.”

Under the President’s order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in Tuesday’s election will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take 30 days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. 19th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college.

Not surprisingly, Donald Trump is not happy with the president’s decision.

“Crooked Hillary lost this election fair and square. They tried to rig this election against me, but the American people didn’t allow that to happen. President Obama doesn’t care about what the American people want. I said the system was rigged all along, and this proves I was right.”

The president also said that the DOJ will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college.

“We have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states. We still need to investigate these claims, but if they are true, we will take all the appropriate actions necessary.”

Paul Horner, a professor of political science at UCLA, believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election.

“Most people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the United States, but there is nothing in the constitution that says that. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 200,000 votes, but because of the electoral college, she still lost. That decision is reserved solely for the 538 electors who meet in their respective states on December 19th. What the people are actually voting for are their states’ electors, not for the President. Though the system is odd and unfair, it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is, with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching. That does not mean, however, that it will continue to work just fine in the future. The way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways, this recent election being one of them.”

Political Analyst Matt Daemon told ABC News that he agrees with the President’s Executive Order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether.

“[The electoral college] is a f—king joke; we should be using the popular vote instead. It may have made sense in 1788, but so did the three fifths compromise. Everyone should have an equal vote, and that’s just not the case with the electoral college. You know what the electoral college gave us? It gave us George W. Bush. It gave us a war in Iraq, and the worst recession since the great depression. It’s time to bring our system into the 21st century. I hope Obama fixes this, because president Trump is going to be a nightmare.”

Obama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward.

“We’re going to investigate the FBI into their role in all of this,” Obama said. “Why did FBI director James Comey on Sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against Clinton after reviewing all of her emails; declaring Hillary Clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election? Why wasn’t this news released earlier? How many votes were lost because of this?” Obama said. “If all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in December, a recount will be ordered.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — Early this morning, President Obama made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency with the signing of Executive Order 14302, which makes it illegal to perform the national anthem at sporting events nationwide. Under the new order, it is now illegal to perform or recite the national anthem in any public venue. Because the anthem is primarily performed before sporting events, this is where the new order will have its biggest impact. Individuals who violate this order can face fines of up to 5,000 dollars and up to one year in federal prison.







The president said that his decision is a show of solidarity with the athletes who have been taking a knee during the anthem to protest police brutality. The President went on to say that the language used in the anthem is “violent” and “hostile to African Americans.”

“If the recent protests by athletes like San Francisco 49ers Quarterback Colin Kaepernick have taught us anything, it’s that the anthem is far too violent and far too polarizing to have any place in the national discourse. Our nation is being torn apart by a song, a song that is outdated and, jingoistic. Without swift action, we cannot move forward as a nation; we cannot heal the wounds of racial division. How can we expect our police officers to stop killing African Americans when the very song of our nation is one that glorifies killing?”

Obama said that he would consider rescinding the order if Congress can come up with a politically correct version that more accurately reflects our changing values as a nation.

“The days of the United States being a domineering world power that seeks to police the entire world through military force are coming to an end,” Obama said. “We need an anthem that reflects the nation we are becoming, not the nation we used to be.”

It has now been over two months since Kaepernick was first spotted sitting down as the national anthem was sung at a preseason NFL game because he refused to “show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.”

In a relatively short period of time, his protest of police brutality and racial injustice in the United States has captivated the country and sparked a debate not only about the state of race relations in America, but about what exactly it means to be a patriot.

Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has already offered her support of President Obama’s decree and has vowed to uphold the order if she wins in November’s general election. She echoed his concerns about the anthem’s militaristic language and called it one of the last remnants of slavery.







Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump had some harsh words for both President Obama and democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over the new Executive Order.

“The hatred that President Obama and crooked Hillary have for this country really knows no bounds,” Trump said at a press conference this morning in southern Iowa. “I can tell you that when I’m elected I’ll have them both thrown in jail, and I’ll make sure that they have to listen to the anthem in their jail cells all day long. I just hope we can stop them from rigging the election.”

Chicago Cubs third baseman Paul Horner said that he will refuse to play until the President’s order is reversed.

“The national anthem is part of the game,” Horner told ESPN. “He might as well outlaw peanuts and crackerjacks. We always sing the anthem before we play ball, so if they aren’t going to sing the anthem, I’m not going to play ball. I think you’re going to find that I’m not the only one who feels this way. I’ve already got at least ten teammates who are ready to join me in a show of solidarity. I really think we can start a trend here.”

The reaction to the new Executive Order has not been all negative, however. Denver Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall, who has himself taken a knee in protest of the National Anthem, called this “A great day not just for African Americans, but for all Americans who value freedom.” He said that “encouraging people to sing a song that contains such blatant nationalism and militarism makes us no better than North Korea”, and causes the majority of Americans to behave like “a pack of rabid, mind-controlled zombies.”

Obama also managed to garner the support of MLB commissioner Rob Manfred.

“People like to watch sports because they provide a distraction from their day to day lives.” the commissioner’s office told CNN via e-mail. “There no need to taint that with political statements. I applaud the President’s leadership on this difficult issue.”







Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward , a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to CNN about the ban.

“This is a story about President Obama banning the National Anthem at sporting events around the country,” Bradley said. “I just want to say a big thanks to every God-fearing, Patriotic American that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps so much .”

Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told CNN he disagrees with the President

“What the President really needs to do is put a ban on masturbation in this country. It is important to remember that our Lord and Savior loves each and every one of us, unless we masturbate, then we’ll burn in Hell for eternity.”

While Executive Order 14302 is likely to be challenged in court, experts say it could be tied up for years, meaning that it is unlikely to be reversed before it takes effect on December 1st. In the meantime, they say to expect numerous protests from those who disagree with the president’s decision.

The Obama Administration has set up a special 24-hour hotline to address any questions and concerns regarding the new Executive Order. The number for the hotline is (785) 273-0325.

Los Angeles, CA — In an ironic twist of a fate, a mascot for a Christian anti-masturbation organization was arrested today for masturbating in public while at a protest being held at the Japanese Embassy in Los Angeles, California.

Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, whose real name is 37-year-old Paul Horner, was arrested at the Japanese Consulate after protesters notified police about a man running through their protest with nothing on except a dolphin mascot head while touching himself. Ironically the protest was over Japan’s annual dolphin drive held in the town of Taiji that kills thousands of dolphins a year. During Horner’s arrest, it was learned he was out on work release from the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility, where he is currently serving eight-years for his 4th arrest of public masturbation along with a charge of aggravated assault on a police officer.

Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she was at the protest when police arrived.

“It was really weird to see a naked man fondling himself and wearing a dolphin’s mascot head while running through a group of dolphin protesters,” Bradley said. “I thought maybe it was a stunt the protesters were doing to get more attention but I guess not.”

Tom Downey with the Los Angeles Police Department, who took Horner into custody, spoke with local news station KABC about the arrest.

“At first we thought he was possibly intoxicated or mentally unstable, ya know, talking about children and how deadly it is for them to masturbate. Telling us he was at the park with a Christian organization speaking to children about the dangers of masturbation. Saying things like, ‘They need to stop playing on the Devil’s playground, stop pounding their Devil stick and ringing the Devil’s doorbell’, we thought he was insane,” Downey said. “Turns out he actually was with this anti-masturbation organization who were accompanying a group of 3rd graders around the park when Horner left the children when he saw images of dolphins on the signs that these protesters were carrying. Mr. Horner said he was ‘aroused’ by all the pictures of dolphins. We further learned that Mr. Horner has four previous arrests for public masturbation, all while employed by this anti-masturbation organization.”







Horner, along with his organization, Stop Masturbation Now, recently finished a federally funded 31-city nationwide school tour which they claim focused on educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation.

Lonnie Childs who is president and founder of Stop Masturbation Now spoke with reporters about the future of the organization after this recent setback.

“Thanks to your tax dollars, Fappy has helped tens of thousands of children learn to live a masturbation-free lifestyle. During his countless visits to schools around the world, Fappy has collected thousands of signatures from children promising to never masturbate; he has done amazing things,” Childs said. “It is a shame how the media is portraying Fappy right now. Paul Horner is a great man. He is passionate about his work, he loves being Fappy and he especially loves the kids. They even have a nickname for him; they call him the tickle monster. But now, all of that is possibly ruined by some trumped-up charges by the Los Angeles five-oh, such a shame.” Childs continued, “These lies about Fappy sicken me to my very core. The employees who supposedly observed the incident in question need to be investigated. What is their motive? Are they masturbators? Are they agents of Big Masturbation? What are their crimes? These are the questions that must be addressed. Furthermore, we have found that, over the years, the only thing that Fappy “beats” are all the fraudulent charges brought against him. I have activated my prayer app and I ask that each and every one of you to keep Fappy in your prayers until this misunderstanding is resolved.”

40-year-old Phil Freedom, who was there protesting at the Japanese Embassy, witnessed the act in question.

“This man just started running around, naked, furiously masturbating and yelling something about how great Donald Trump was. He then put on this dolphin mascot head and attempted to hump one of our protest signs that had an image of a dolphin on it. It was absolutely horrifying.”

On the group’s Facebook page, news was posted of the arrest.

“All my faithful Fappy followers, I have some extremely bad news to report. I want you to hear it here first before the liberal media hate machine and Big Masturbation spread their lies about this incident. Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, whose real name is Paul Horner, an inmate at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility, was out on work release in Los Angeles, California this morning. Fappy, as usual, was educating elementary school children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation. Somehow he got separated from the group and joined up with a dolphin protest at the Japanese Embassy there. It is “reported” by “police” that he took off his mascot costume and began running around naked while touching himself. Our lawyers tell us he is being charged with public masturbation, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. He is currently being held at the Los Angeles Central Jail until a bond is set by a judge, this happening hopefully soon. These are obviously lies, but until we have all the information, please don’t jump to any conclusions. Please keep Fappy in your prayers during this difficult time. Praise Fappy!”

Horner’s attorney, Katie Glacier, told ABC News that the dolphin mascot is innocent of these crimes but will continue teaching masturbation prevention while in prison.

“Horner is in good spirits and patiently waiting to see a judge for his bond hearing,” Smith said. “Horner told me he is innocent, but if found guilty, says he will put an end to inmate masturbation in every jail and prison across the country, starting with the one he is currently serving time at. I personally was not aware of this information about the penal system, but it seems jail is just a hotbed for self-rape and immoral acts. Horner is a saint, a hero, a prophet, and a savior to all the lost heathenish souls out there with deadly masturbation addictions.” Glacier continued, “This may be his fifth arrest for masturbating in public, and may be currently serving an eight-year prison term for the same crimes, but that doesn’t mean he’s guilty this time. If Donald Trump was President, this wouldn’t have happened, or if it did, Fappy would be immediately pardoned. I guess at this time, all I can ask is that you please keep Fappy in your prayers during these difficult times.”

Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin and Stop Masturbation Now are federally funded programs designed to teach children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation. For more information or if you would like the group to visit your child’s school call (785) 273-0325.

UPDATE: THIS WORKED, GIVING DONALD TRUMP THE PRESIDENCY

COLUMBUS, OH (AP) — History was made today in Columbus, Ohio when more than 3 million Amish poured into the city to see the American Amish Brotherhood (AAB), an organization which acts as an informal governing body for the Amish community, endorse Donald Trump for president. That number represents a significant portion of the total Amish population, which the United States Census Bureau says numbers more than 20 million men and women nationwide all pledging their vote to Trump for President. With the full force of the Amish community behind him, Donald Trump is now mathematically guaranteed to win the presidency in November.







The organization typically meets once a year and the meetings usually consist of about 300 Amish leaders who meet to discuss the challenges, such as urban sprawl, that face the community. This year, however, the organization wanted as many people in attendance as possible so they can effectively instruct all Amish men and women of legal voting age to cast their vote for the flamboyant Republican nominee.

The Amish, who are direct descendants of the protestant reformation sect known as the Anabaptists, have typically stayed out of politics in the past. As a general rule, they don’t vote, serve in the military, or engage in any other displays of patriotism. This year, however, the AAB has said that it is imperative that they get involved in the democratic process.

“Over the past eight years, the Democratic Party has launched a systematic assault on biblical virtues,” said AAB Chairman Elijah Fisher. “We have seen more and more Christians being persecuted for their faith; we have seen the state defile the institution of marriage allowing the homogays to come together just like normal people. And now, they want to put a woman in the nation’s highest leadership role in direct violation of my favorite Bible passage, 1 Timothy 2:12, ‘I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet’.” Fisher continued, “We need to stop this assault on God and take a stand for biblical principles. Donald Trump has shown in both action and deed that he is committed to restoring this country to the Lord’s way.”

According to statistician Nate Silver of the website fivethirtyeight.com, there are no possible scenarios in which Hillary Clinton can win with Donald Trump carrying the Amish vote.

“The Amish have their highest numbers in perennial swing states like Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa,” Silver noted. “They also have strong numbers in reliably Democratic states like Michigan, Illinois, and New York, meaning that Hillary will lose those states as well. There is also a sizeable community in Florida which, while not as large as it is in the Midwest, is still large enough to turn Florida for Trump. Over the next two weeks, you can expect Hillary to enter into a state of freefall in all of my predictive models.”

37-year-old Paul Horner, a self-proclaimed “Donald Trump supporter since day one” told Leilani Hernandez, a reporter with local Columbus news station WBNS-10TV he is thrilled that Trump will be the next President.

“This is such great news, a Trump victory, I knew it would happen, I have been praying for it night and day,” Horner said. “Plus I work November 8th and it was going to be tough for me to get off work and vote because my boss is not the nicest of people. But now thanks to the great Amish people of this country, they have this thing locked up for a Donald Trump victory against crooked Hillary and I won’t have to miss work! God is good!”

The Clinton campaign issued a written statement to the AAB asking them to reconsider their decision.







“I don’t believe that Donald Trump is the person who best represents your interests,” Clinton wrote to the AAB. “As a career real estate developer, he represents a clear threat to your simple way of life. As former first lady of Arkansas, I understand the concerns of rural Americans more than any candidate in this election. I implore you to consider all of the facts before voting for my opponent.”

Most pundits believe that Mrs. Clinton’s plea is too little too late.

During a press conference in Manhattan early this morning, Trump thanked the AAB for their support and promised to put the Amish to work maintaining government buildings, which he said would save taxpayers millions because “the Amish do great work, the best work, for a very low price.”

Though Clinton has pledged to stay in the race until the very end, many of her campaign workers have already resigned. According to the Associated Press, it is expected that the Clinton campaign will lose 50% of its staff within the next week. There is a general mood of hopelessness and despair in the Clinton camp, and many simply want to cut their losses.

“It looked like she was going to win this election easily,” said Tom Downey, a campaign manager in Ohio, “But this is what happens when you wake a sleeping giant. Clearly, Mrs. Clinton took far too much for granted in this race, and we are all now paying the price. It’s really sad to see the campaign end this way.”

The AAB chooses weekly charities for those wishing to support what they do. The AAB’s charity for the week of November 4th is Sock It Forward, a charity that provides the homeless with brand new socks . If you are interested in learning more about the Amish community and the AAB, you can contact the Pennsylvania Amish Heritage Museum at (785) 273-0325.

WASHINGTON — Just two days after the funeral for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last week of a heart attack at the age of 79, President Obama signed Executive Order 14651, which appoints Rashad Hussain as the new Supreme Court Justice to replace Scalia.

“We cannot wait for a new President or the Senate Republicans to fill this vacancy left by Scalia, so I have taken it upon myself to do what needed to be done,” Obama told reporters at a press conference today. “Republican Senators believe that it is appropriate not to act on such an important matter, and as I have shown today, I do not agree with that.”

Hussain, of Muslim heritage, is an attorney who has served as US Special Envoy to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the second largest intergovernmental body after the UN, and as US Special Envoy for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications. Hussain has also served in the White House Counsel’s Office and on the National Security Council as a political appointee of the Obama Administration.







Even though under the Constitution, it is the President’s job to nominate Supreme Court justices, Obama’s selection is already drawing sharp criticism from Republicans. Presidential hopeful Donald Trump told ABC News that he does not agree with the President’s decision.”

“Hussain is a Muslim and a sympathizer, just like Obama, and now he takes over the legacy the great Antonin Scalia left behind. The President should be ashamed of himself.”

“The American people should have had a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said. “Appointing a Muslim to replace Scalia is absolutely appalling.”

Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward , a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she fully supports Obama’s decision.

“We needed someone in there to fill that spot as quickly as possible,” Bradley said. “Regardless if you agree with Obama’s appointed choice of Hussain, Scalia was a disgrace to the Supreme Court. He was a religious radical, a bigot, a racist, against women’s rights, gay rights and human rights in general; there’s absolutely no reason a person like that should have ever had power like that in the first place. He will always be remembered as being on the wrong side of history.”

David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes, a website that takes the fun out of stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, who is also currently being sued by Fox News for calling them a “fake news site”, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.

“This type of story, when it goes viral, and we debunk it, we make money,” Mikkelson said. “We use our cookie-cutter outlines, we copy and paste the original article into ours, type in one or two sentences of original content and then we make hella cash. If it wasn’t for people like Internet news satirist Paul Horner, my children wouldn’t have been able to go to college.”

Legal experts believe Republicans will attempt to block Obama’s appointee until he’s out of office, leaving the court with a gaping vacant seat for nearly a year.

“Obama has a right to do what he did, but we’ll fight him to the end on this,” Tom Downey of the Republican National Lawyers Association told reporters. “This will not stand, ya know, this aggression will not stand, man.”

PHOENIX A.Z. (AP) — For months now, rumors have circulated the Internet that individuals were being paid to protest at rallies held by presidential hopeful Donald Trump. Today a man from Trump’s rally in Fountain Hills, Arizona back in March has come forward to say that he was paid to protest the event.

“I was given $3,500 to protest Donald Trump’s rally in Fountain Hills,” said 38-year-old Paul Horner. “I answered a Craigslist ad about a group needing actors for a political event. I interviewed with them and got the part.”

Trump supporters have been claiming that protesters are being paid by the Bernie Sanders’ campaign, but Horner disagrees.

“As for who these people were affiliated with that interviewed me, my guess would be Hillary Clinton’s campaign,” Horner said. “The actual check I received after I was done with the job was from a group called ‘Women Are The Future’. After I was hired, they told me if anyone asked any questions about who I was with or communicated with me in any way, I should start talking about how great Bernie Sanders is.” Horner continued, “It was mostly women in their 60’s at the interview that I went to. Plus, all the people that I communicated with had an AOL email address. No one still has an AOL email address except people that would vote for Hillary Clinton.”

“I knew those weren’t real protesters, they were too organized and smart,” said 59-year-old Tom Downey, a Trump supporter who attended the rally in Fountain Hills. “I knew there was something up when they started shouting all these facts and nonsense like that. The best we could do was just yell and punch em’ and stuff.” Downey continued, “I think we did a good job though. I was shouting at them the whole time, calling them losers, telling them to get a job or go back home to mommy’s house; I got a bunch of high-fives from my fellow Trump supporters. It was a great time.”

When asked about the other protesters at the rally, Horner said he saw most of them during the interview and training for the rally.

“Almost all of the people I was protesting with I had seen at my interview and training class. At the rally, talking with some of them, I learned they only paid Latinos $500, Muslims $600 and African Americans $750. I don’t think they were looking for any Asians. Women and children were paid half of what the men got and illegals received $300 across the board. I think I was paid more than the other protesters because I was white and had taken classes in street fighting and boxing a few years back”

Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she does not understand why Trump protesters would need to be paid.

“I’ll protest that guy for free,” Bradley said. “Trump is creating a place for like-minded, ignorant, bigoted, hate-filled individuals to gather and unite. You wouldn’t have to pay me anything to protest that.” Bradley continued, “Trump supporters are the last kind of people to donate socks to the homeless, they only care about themselves and their white race. I would love the day I ever see a donation from a Trump supporter, I think it would make me change my opinion about them.”

Horner said the group had a mandatory six-hour training class that had to be completed before protesting at Trump’s rally.

“During training we were taught chants to shout like ‘Dump Trump’ and ‘Trump Is A Racist’, things like that. We were told how to respond to anti-Trump comments too. If a Trump supporter said something about how great his wall will be, the Latinos in our group would say, ‘We’re just going to tunnel underneath it.’ They even gave me a shirt to wear at the rally which said ‘F*ck Donald Trump’ along with a sign to hold that said ‘Make America White Again’.”

David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.

“You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the Silverback gorilla my wife Barbara always wanted since she was a child,” Mikkleson said. “We claim ‘to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well‘, but that’s just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and that’s it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and I’m only telling you this for legal reasons. For example, do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its tax-exempt status? Did you actually read our story? Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax? What is the actual website URL? We claim to know it, but no real information is posted by us.” Mikkelson continues, “It is common for us to rewrite a story we’re debunking if we don’t like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a person’s name from the original article and then called him a liar, oh the hypocrisy, but it is so funny at the same time! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search that locates the actual article will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money,” Mikkelson laughs. “And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Plus, I know for our writers like Kim LaCapria, it is way more fun for them to cause controversy than report the facts; it results in more visitors. Kim LaCapria and Jeff Zarronandia go as far as accusing the site that the story originated from as ‘a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false “news” stories‘. The thing that is troubling about these claims and what Snopes and our authors are known for. We don’t list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up our claims; It’s just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work? To be honest, I’d say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real, actual, work.”

ABC News reached out to Hillary Clinton’s campaign for comment but did not receive a response. At the time of this posting, ads for the group were caring disclaimers which read, “At this time we are not accepting application for Muslims or persons who look of Middle Eastern descent.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — Following the results of Tuesday night’s election, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13805, which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December 19th. Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day, too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted, equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically.

“People all over the country have been flooding my office with calls, telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers,” Obama told reporters. “Many have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a Hillary Clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as President. This was especially bad in areas of Florida and North Carolina where there are high numbers of Latino and African American voters. We must investigate these claims. The margin of victory is too close to call, and the outcome of this election is too important. There is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for Trump.”

Under the President’s order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in Tuesday’s election will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take 30 days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. 19th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college.

Not surprisingly, Donald Trump is not happy with the president’s decision.

“Crooked Hillary lost this election fair and square. They tried to rig this election against me, but the American people didn’t allow that to happen. President Obama doesn’t care about what the American people want. I said the system was rigged all along, and this proves I was right.”

The president also said that the DOJ will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college.

“We have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states. We still need to investigate these claims, but if they are true, we will take all the appropriate actions necessary.”

Paul Horner, a professor of political science at UCLA, believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election.

“Most people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the United States, but there is nothing in the constitution that says that. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 200,000 votes, but because of the electoral college, she still lost. That decision is reserved solely for the 538 electors who meet in their respective states on December 19th. What the people are actually voting for are their states’ electors, not for the President. Though the system is odd and unfair, it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is, with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching. That does not mean, however, that it will continue to work just fine in the future. The way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways, this recent election being one of them.”

Political Analyst Matt Daemon told ABC News that he agrees with the President’s Executive Order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether.

“[The electoral college] is a f—king joke; we should be using the popular vote instead. It may have made sense in 1788, but so did the three fifths compromise. Everyone should have an equal vote, and that’s just not the case with the electoral college. You know what the electoral college gave us? It gave us George W. Bush. It gave us a war in Iraq, and the worst recession since the great depression. It’s time to bring our system into the 21st century. I hope Obama fixes this, because president Trump is going to be a nightmare.”

Obama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward.

“We’re going to investigate the FBI into their role in all of this,” Obama said. “Why did FBI director James Comey on Sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against Clinton after reviewing all of her emails; declaring Hillary Clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election? Why wasn’t this news released earlier? How many votes were lost because of this?” Obama said. “If all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in December, a recount will be ordered.”

If you have any questions about the recount or the special December 19th election, you can call the Obama administration’s special election hotline at (785) 273-0325.

The following is a personal journal of mine I’ve put together that spans my life over the last 20 years; since one of my first legal battles, one of them being Microsoft when I was a teenager to my first article that I wrote that went viral, to a crazy night in Thailand, waking up in a bath tub filled with ice and a missing kidney but a really friendly, well-written apology letter taped to the wall next to me and money for breakfast. It was a recommendation for a local diner and I ended up giving that restaurant five stars on Yelp. So, go on, feel free to read my life story, and enjoy! A lot of this is just rambling and links to stuff, so be ready for that the farther you scroll down the page as I’m still working on cleaning this page up. There is also a lot of stuff out there that I don’t know about or have not posted. If you know of anything good to add, please feel free to send me a link. Also, when reading the following, I think it is important to keep an open mind and also understand that everything doesn’t have to be satire or like “The Onion“. I write political humor, comedy, hoaxes, factual articles etc etc etc. I write stories with a purpose, things I see wrong in society and stuff that I feel passionate about. In the past, the articles that I wrote were always called political satire, hoaxes, pranks, satire and shenanigans, but now with the whole “fake news” epidemic going on out there, I’m now lumped into just that single category. Personally, I think everything that is happening right now is a great thing. With Donald Trump calling everything he doesn’t like “fake news” and me doing what I’m doing, the general public is finally waking up to the reality of questioning the news you read and the importance of fact checking. That was always a goal for me when I started out doing this, so now that all of this is actually happening, I’m really happy. Follow me on Facebook and Twitter ! I love some of you!

Wikipedia calls me an “Internet news satirist and writer”, and I like that, so that’s the reason for that part of the title of this thing.

Snopes says, “Paul Horner, the prolific writer and ubiquitous satirical character who inserts his name into all his articles“. And since I use my name as a character in all of my stories, Snopes has a lot of links to me.

The NY Post calls me an “online jokester.”

The Washington Post calls Paul Horner, “The Internet’s most prolific hoax artist.”

International Business Times: Paul Horner, the world’s biggest penis and the everyman of Internet hoax history.

Mass Appeal says, “The super pseudo-media heavyweight Paul Horner, aka Lando Tabloid-ia.”

The Huffington Post calls Paul Horner a “performance artist”

“The Mark Twain of our generation,” Aaron Johnson owner of Lawn Gnome Publishing.

Maxim also agrees that I have the biggest penis in the world.

I get this posted on my Facebook wall a lot:



I started a non profit 501(c)(3) charity a few years ago, Sock It Forward , which gives out thousands of pairs of brand-new socks every month to homeless people in such places as Arizona and Mexico. Thanks to everyone who has donated money, socks and/or volunteered to this great cause; every bit helps so much!!!

Paul Horner

From Wikipedia: For the past two years, Paul Horner has written for the website National Report with the Washington Post describing him as its “lead writer”. Horner uses his own name as a recurring character in all of his stories, including the actor behind “Fappy the Anti-Masturbation Dolphin“, a character created by Horner that is used as a running gag in many of his stories and currently has over 40,000 likes/followers. National Report has run multiple articles claiming Horner to be the street artist Banksy, and he has fielded numerous interviews from foreign journalists as a result. After writing a story about marrying his dog, Horner was invited onto a television show for a segment about “weird relationships”. The country of India has an arrest warrant out for Horner after a “rape festival” story that he wrote for the city of Assam.”

Residents of DeQuincy, Louisiana threatened to have him arrested as a result of numerous hoax articles he had written about the city, including stories about bath salts turning the residents into zombies and the city outlawing twerking.

For years Horner has regularly included the phone number of the Westboro Baptist Church in his articles, with one story referring to it as the number of the “24-hour National Muslim Appreciation Hotline”, stating “Anything to tie up their phone lines is a good thing.

Since Horner uses his name as a character in all of his articles, a fun Google search is “Paul Horner“.

Horner has been writing political satire, comedy and hoaxes seriously for the last 5 years, but has always been into some kind of shenanigans.

#1 search on Google for “Biggest Penis in the world”… so it must be true.



In December of 2014, Paul Horner resigned from National Report to start News Examiner.



After I resigned from National Report around December of 2014 to start News Examiner, Allen Montgomery (the owner of National Report) immediately removed all the ads within my articles and replaced them with his own. He also replaced the name of the character “Paul Horner”, which was in all my stories, to “Dan Stevens”. He then deleted my pen name, Darius Rubics, as the author of my own stories and replaced them with “National Reporting Staff”. After complaining, he deleted ALL of my articles that I worked so hard on since I began working with National Report in early 2013. Seeing this, most of the authors were angry, as I was of course and contacted me offering condolences. After this he also fired some of his best writers because they were associating with me. That is actually where I got my video guy, Eric Foster, after Allen fired him. I told Allen I would never approach any of his writers with job offers, and I never did. Luckily I have all my work posted on Super Official News, so it is not lost, but it still hurts. Allen even deleted my Banksy story that had over 5 million Facebook shares and climbing 🙁

From Paul Horner’s Facebook page:

“Wikipedia says I’m an “internet news satirist and article writer for numerous online satirical news sites”. I love art, drawing and other creative things. I love my family and friends. I occasionally do stand-up comedy.”

FAPPY FUN FACT: Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin has over 47,000 likes/followers on Facebook and has been arrested four times for public masturbation and has been pardoned by the governor.

It’s all just a fun hobby, Michael Moore is making a movie about it (link)(link), and a great way to sell merch!

A big thank you to the funny and talented Erick Biez for hosting and playing along perfectly considering this was the first attempt at this. You seriously can’t see anything out of this mask and you have to yell for people to hear you. Working on fixing that. Also, thank you so much Matt Storrs for filming!

Paul Horner has a drink named after him because of his Banksy story and hoax. It’s their most popular drink.

One of the most popular drinks on Silver’s winter drink menu is the Paul Horner. The ingredient that makes this cocktail specifically unique is red bell pepper. Intrigued? Us too.



Because of my Banksy hoax story I wrote a couple months ago about him getting arrested and outed as Paul Horner, a fancy restaurant (like $200 steaks) that actually owns two original Banksy’s… named a drink called ‘The Paul Horner’. It’s their most popular drink – like a $50+ drink. And this place, it’s called ‘Silver’, is where the Winter Olympics were held, the Sundance film festival is etc. Millionaires bring in their own tequila to make my drink how they like it.

Think about this…. ALL drinks start from somewhere. For example, that drink “Tom Collins”, that started from a real guy named “Tom Collins”, and now because of the popularity of my drink, a few other places are starting to serve it.

Look at the ingredients, so many and so elaborate. This is not a rum and coke ha. Makes me so happy and I want to drink it now! I was featured in Vice News, Banksy knows of me and my name, and now I have my own drink. I can die now.This is a review for my drink:

http://dishingpc.com/silvers-paul-horner/ This is the restaurant that started serving ‘The Paul Horner’.

www.silverrestaurant.com/. I spoke with them. They said it tastes like a bloody marry and a margarita kind of. They are sending me out a care package with bottles of tequila and all the 15 or so ingredients to make this thing. And this is out of UTAH! I love the idea of Mormons getting wasted off of me. Makes me so hard.If you never read my Banksy story that 8 billion people saw, here it is:

NAMES OF CHARACTERS USED IN STORIES:

I tend to use the name Tom Downey as a character in most of my stories. Not only is it a great name, he is a great friend of mine and enjoys my shenanigans. My name, ‘Paul Horner’, is in ALL of my stories. I began doing this when people would steal my work, which is fine, don’t care, zero percent, but they would not credit me. So this is a way for them to credit me without them knowing.

Eric Foster has done all my Entertainment Tonight style videos in the past, until they were all deleted by Allen Montgomery, owner of National Report.

BLACK FRIEND CONNECT:

Jerome Smith AKA Paul Horner, the man behind BlackFriendConnect.com, sits down with Rob Redding for a one-on-one interview. You will not believe this!!!

FUN FACT: My friend Ivan calls in at the end and says the best line ever, “How would one go about talking to a black person?”

Fun With DeQuincy, Louisiana

In the past three years, whenever I needed a crap town to base my story in, I’ve used the town of DeQuincy, Louisiana. My friend Brandon Adams said there is like 4,000 people that live there and all they do is drink Old Milwaukee’s Best and beat their wives. I only pick on them because, they threatened me first with castration.

It started from this ridiculous story, Gay Zombie Attack In Louisiana From Bath Salts Leaves 7 Dead, and after how serious they took it with going as far as sending me death threats, I had to continue my fun with DeQuincy.

With DeQuincy, I think it was my story about their town making Twerking illegal that was the final straw.

From ABC News:

http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/09/twerking-ban-pranks-louisiana-town/

This Huffington Post video actually has the mayor saying, “It’s all nothing but a bunch of hogwash.”

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/19/twerking-hoax_n_3953281.html

But they only let you watch the first 35 seconds and to see the rest where he actually says “hogwash”, you have to pay. I guess the The Huffington Post now has a paid section, those greedy bastards.

There are so many videos and stories about Twerking being banned and illegal in DeQuincy its ridiculous – Google that

This following one here is pretty good. But they leave out the part with the mayor saying “hogwash”. So disappoint. Though they do mention my friend Brandon Adams and a few other stories I’ve done about DeQuincy that are “hogwash”.

Helping Rape Victims In India

The Punjab Rape Festival In India Begins This Week

The article received WELL OVER 10,000,000 views. Though, that number is very small compared to what it actually probably could have been. National Report’s servers were down most the time because of too much traffic, so it was impossible to keep accurate records. But there were thousands of websites covering the news, especially from America and India, so it was well known regardless and each side posted its own opinion of the article.

In the end, India blamed EVERYTHING on the country of Uganda, which I thought was super random. But it’s not; read about the feud between India and Uganda. It’s kind of like America stealing and bringing slaves from Africa. Very interesting.

Months after the article was seen by almost everyone on the planet, India started publicly hanging rapists in the middle of a town square or other public places for all to see. They issued public statements saying they were going to be much harsher on rapists. They replaced most of their current police staff in charge of rape with new officers who didn’t abide by religious laws or other “shunning” or “honor killing” tactics that were previously used. There were many people from India who contacted National Report thanking them for it’s “world wide embarrassment of India” over the subject of “India’s problem with rape”. They said India takes their reputation very seriously and when this article was seen by “almost every person in India”, they got extremely angry. They wanted to behead everyone at National Report (National Report received LOTS of death threats) and they wanted to do something about their SERIOUS problem of rape so other countries wouldn’t view them like this… so they did something, and it was actually very extreme. And if you follow the news, since this article, there has not been much news about India and the subject of rape. It’s not news anymore because all the statistics are down and there is no major news except them being much tougher on rapists. Was it because of this article? Who knows, but things seriously changed in India with rape laws and charges and arrests after this article went mega-viral. Plus, because of all the visitors, the India donation site for helping the women there, GiveIndia.org, contacted me a year after the story was first published, thanking me for raising over $200,000 from the link to them I had within the story. I currently have warrants out for my arrest in the towns of Punjab and Assam because of this story.

Google “Assam Rape Festival” and you’ll see all the craziness from my article.

http://newsexaminer.net/opinion/rape-festival-india-begins/

The UPDATE is at the bottom of that link. The top part of the story is for shock value to get people to donate and is what got billions of views. The update below that is just what happened afterwards, that I don’t mind writing about, now that I feel somewhat safe, and don’t feel my head could be chopped off at any moment.

So I made the mistake of listing my cell number as the 24/hr McDonald’s Robot Hotline, in case people had further questions about my story I wrote about the McDonald’s in Phoenix that is run entirely by robots, that doesn’t even exist. So my story has been copied a thousand times and my cell phone number is all over the internet as the 24/hr McDonald’s Robot Hotline, and it won’t stop fucking ringing. But it’s pretty fun. When I answer, I tell people McDonald’s keeps thousands of us locked up in a giant call center, in a bunker somewhere in North Korea and only feeds us Big Macs. I tell them, the robots are evolving and becoming aware. I ask them if they’ve ever seen the Terminator movies, ya know, just fun stuff like that. Oh, my phone is ringing again…

WEBSITE DOMAIN DISPUTES FROM YEARS AGO… Probably around 2000 – 2004

Microsoft Corporation vs. Paul Horner

http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2002/d2002-0029.html

This was around 2000 when you could copy a website’s HTML and it looked exactly like their site. Now it’s all CSS and Javascript and WordPress and databases, so there’s no way to do this anymore. Anyway, my microsoftsite.com website looked EXACTLY like Microsoft’s website, except mine had drawings done in Paint of Bill Gates giving head to Satan along with many other humorous images and written articles by me.

The reason I lost the site to Microsoft, was because I posted porn ads on it, from a porn company I was working at (see below). You can do parody all day long and keep a domain name, but when you get “real”… the actually company can get “real” and then take away your domain name. Stupid move on my part, but a lesson learned.

Amazon Corporation vs Paul Horner

http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2003/d2003-0071.html

From the internet:

The United Nations World Intellectual Property Organization came down on the side of common sense once again, ruling Friday that Amazonbooks.net and Amazonbooks.org had to be handed over to Amazon.com. Paul Horner, the previous owner of both domains, had claimed that he simply provided resources for travelers and amateur geographers by playing off the Amazon River. WIPO, though, reported in its findings that the pages carried only a handful of links to external resources about the South American river and a number of links to rival retailers. Much of the “information” was along the lines of a picture of a tropical bird, captioned “A colorful bird.” Thus the organization judged the site’s true purpose to be squatting on Amazon’s valuable trademark. As of press time, the sites were still up, but affiliates had deleted their accounts.

When they won the original court case by taking my domain name amazonbooks.net, I noticed that amazonbooks.org was available. So I dropped $10 on it and then contacted them by email.

Dear Amazon,

Congratulations on your victory in taking amazonbooks.net from me. I tip my hat to you.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me at paul@amazonbooks.org.

Love,

Paul Horner

They did not like that.

They had to spend all new court fees and lawyer costs etc etc to take away amazonbooks.org from me. It was fantastic.

I also had my best from Toby Konno call them as my attorney and he acted like Troy McClure from the Simpsons:

“Hi Amazon, I’m Troy McClure. You may remember me from such court cases as Roe vs. Wade and the OJ Simpson trial.”

I wish I had recorded some of those phone calls. By far the funniest conversations ever had on a telephone.



Long story short, Amazon finally got pissed off enough at me and actually sued me for $700,000. Like 700 real thousand dollars.

And they lost.

In court it was just me versus four Amazon lawyers, who flew in from California.

The judge asked me:

“Mr. Horner, if I find in favor of Amazon, how do you plan to pay this $700,000 they are suing you for?”

I quickly responded, “Your honor, it’s no problem. I can cut them a check right now for the full amount, but I might have to post date it for the rest of my life.”

The judge started laughing and so did the court reporter. Anyway, I won that case, didn’t have to pay Amazon a penny, the judge just said I couldn’t register any more “Amazon” domain names. And that was fine with me, because by that time, it was boring and not fun anymore and I had moved on to other shenanigans.

Here is the court case:

This one was fun… Monster.com sued me twice and lost both times. I owned monsterjobs.net and monsterjobs.org and because of my SEO skills the sites would show up at the top of Google when you searched for “Monster Jobs” and other related search terms. Finally I got tired of the sites and just let them expire. Here is an old copy of some of the original site. I actually provided “Monster Jobs” (like haunted house jobs and Hollywood monster movie roles) and that’s why Monster.com couldn’t take the domain names from me… and I made quite a bit of money from ad revenue at the top of the sites from real job sites. Pretty fun times 🙂

COLLEGE – 1998 – 2001

I have a couple associate degrees in website administration and computer animation from The Phoenix Art Institute.

My first job after graduating from college was for LightSpeed Media… a porn company, I think around the year 2001… something like that. I found it funny that the human resource person for the Art Institute recommended me for a porn job. It was a fun year working for them and I learned a lot.. like what desperate 18-year old girls will do to pay their rent. This image below is from their ls-university.com website. I would now have been a multi-millionaire if I would have stayed working with them, they’re absolutely HUGE now, but it’s a pretty gross industry and I’m glad I didn’t stay with that. The naked girls were nice though. I remember walking into work everyday and seeing naked girls putting various objects in themselves, it was neat. Steve Jones AKA Steve LightSpeed, the owner of the company, also let me shoot video of the girls for the website. This was mainly because at the time it was just him and me working for the company, and now they have hundreds of employees and too many websites to even count. I remember asking him, “You know I graduated from art school to do web design and don’t know how to shoot porn.” He told me, “Paul, it’s super easy. Just film what you would masturbate to.” And he was right… I was quite the cameraman.

Fun fact: You can see my couch in this picture, which was in the living room of the first house I owned in Phoenix, Arizona. And I drank that Corona.



My idol is Bill Murray, a living legend. Because of this I started the “Bill Murray Party Crashing Tour” to honor Murray. It ended up going world wide with thousands of parties in each city and thousands of pictures submitted. I have direct information that Bill Murray found out about the hoax and absolutely loved it.

Gov. Jan Brewer slams satirical report that Arizona is launching gay conversion classes in all public schools

A spokesman for the governor called the fake article ‘vile’ and said ‘its authors should be ashamed.’

http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/arizona-not-start-gay-conversion-classes-public-school-article-1.1434395

I love this one so much. That evil, racist bitch had to actually go on LIVE television to say it was a hoax, because EVERYONE believed it. If EX-governor Brewer could put all the gay people and minorities in the gas chamber, she would. But unfortunately for her there is these things called “laws”. Ugh, what a bummer for her!

Louisiana Man Stops Robbery By Quoting Pulp Fiction

This story first appeared on my site IYWIB. Then I rewrote it for my site Super Official News. After that I redid it for National Report before the owner, Allen Montgomery, got upset when I left and deleted all of the two years worth of work I did for him. It’s a good thing I have copies. Anyway, the latest version is now on my new site, News Examiner.

This story is from a real dream I had. I was the one who stopped the robbery. Since the story was first published, it has received 10’s of millions of views.

My favorite part is that Quentin Tarantino knows of this story and likes it and it was featured on the Miramax website. (That’s the company that put out Pulp Fiction – my favorite movie)

FUN FACT: I’ve partied with Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez in Austin, Texas. Quentin loved me because of my story and because I wore an “I <3 Lesbians” t-shirt to a $150 steak restaurant. He drinks Jack and Coke FYI.

MY CRAZY DAD

My dad is a horrible person. He is locked in the Fox News echo-chamber of ignorance, is super racist and is also a complete Sociopath. No one in our family wants ANYTHING to do with him. But, I do get a lot of my talents from his genes, I will give him that. But thank the universe that my awesome mom, who is an amazing artist, my best friend and my biggest fan, keeps me grounded.

Anyway, so he lives in Utah, the only state left that will still take him, and I like to do stories about St. George where he lives, just to mess with him because it’s funny.

So I one of the many things I’ve done, is I wrote a story about porn becoming illegal in St. George Utah:

http://archive.thespectrum.com/article/20130924/NEWS01/309240018/Satirical-report-talks-St-George-porn-ban

And the best thing ever… these talented folks made a really, really good video, like the show Cops, for the St. George Porn Task Force. They were interviewed on a major Utah radio station about news of my story and also talked about their video. I spoke with these guys briefly through email too; really nice, funny, friendly individuals. A must watch!



For two years I convinced my dad I was a raging homosexual

My dad hates gay people and minorities, so I’ve recently convinced him that I’m gay now. Here’s a picture I sent him the other night, supposedly of my boyfriend and I, wishing him a happy New Year. Waking up the next morning hungover, I forgot I did this. But I was soon reminded by at least 10 angry messages saying how disappointed he was and how he doesn’t want anything to do with me. I’m so sad I couldn’t have found a big black dude to take the picture with, that would have been way better.

He finally figured it out that I am indeed straight… Really bummed me out. I don’t think there is anything better than having a crazy Fox News, Bible-Thumper believing his son is super gay. I should have taken this picture hugging a random black guy and sent that to him, that would have been better, but this works.

UPDATE: 4/1/17

I started a new website called The St. George Gazette, in honor of my dad. Good times.

The British High Court is seriously considering prosecuting former Prime Minister Tony Blair over the illegal war in Iraq.

The Iraq war was unnecessary and went against United Nations law, Michael Manfield QC told the high court in an opening statement on Wednesday.

Mansfield represents former Iraqi general Abdulwaheed al-Rabbat, who wishes to seek justice for the millions of Iraqi citizens needlessly killed since the war began in 2003.

The Guardian reports: Rabbat, said Mansfield, was motivated by last year’s publication of the report of the Chilcot inquiry into the 2003 Iraq war.

Mansfield summarised the report’s findings as: “Saddam Hussein did not pose an urgent threat to the UK, intelligence reporting about [Iraqi] weapons of mass destruction was presented with unwarranted certainty, that the war was unnecessary and that the UK undermined the authority of the UN security council.”

“Nothing could be more emphatic than these findings,” he said. “It was an unlawful war.”

Mansfield argued that when the British prosecutor, Sir Hartley Shawcross, opened the cases against Nazi leaders at the Nuremburg war crimes trials at the end of the second world war, he acted as though the crime of aggression had already been assimilated into English law.

An initial application to launch the prosecution was dismissed at Westminster magistrates court on the grounds that Blair enjoys immunity and that the crime of aggression does not exist in English law.

The court was told that attempts to persuade the international criminal court to prosecute to the former Labour prime minister for invading Iraq have made no significant progress.

The crime of aggression was finally defined in 2010 by the ICC, the high court heard, but it has not yet been ratified by a sufficient number of states.

The high court appeal is being heard by the lord chief justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, and Mr Justice Ouseley.

The current attorney general, Jeremy Wright QC, has intervened in the case to argue that the crime does not exist in the statute book. “The crime of aggression is not known to English law,” James Eadie QC, for the attorney general, told the court.

He also relied on a 2006 House of Lords ruling, R v Jones, which unanimously found that the international law crime of aggression is not an offence under domestic legislation in the UK.

A number of Iraqi supporters of Rabbat sat at the back of the court. Speaking before the hearing started, Sabah al-Mukhtar, of the Arab Lawyers Network, said: “This is just looking at whether the first court was right in refusing to entertain the case.

“The magistrates court dismissed it on the grounds that Tony Blair had immunity and that the crime of aggression was not part of English law. Many think they were not correct on that.”

Rabbat, a former chief of staff of the Iraqi army, was not in court. He currently lives in the Omani capital, Muscat; he is said not even to own a passport.

His lawyers said he has been able to bring the case in British courts because the UK previously occupied Iraq. Under the European Convention on Human Rights he is therefore deemed to have been within the jurisdiction at a relevant time.

The high court reserved its decision and allowed a further week for Rabbat’s lawyers to make additional specified submissions. If the judges do not dismiss the appeal, the issue of whether the crime of aggression exists in English law will be sent up to the supreme court to decide.

Konstantin Kosachev, the head of the upper house Committee for International Relations, says that the Western media has distorted information about Russia’s intentions, using it as a weapon in their information war.

The Russian Senator has called for reporters to disclose their real motives in order to debunk the myth of a ‘Russian danger’ that is circulating in the media.

RT reports:

In an article published in the popular daily Izvestia on Tuesday, Senator Konstantin Kosachev wrote that the Western mass media distorted information about Russia’s intentions as the main weapon in their information war.

The main objective behind this is the creation of a myth that portrays Russia as an aggressor nation, the senator added.

“Thanks to all these Orwellian statements we are now living in some sort of an inside-out reality. In which unanimous informational baiting is called an anti-propaganda campaign, sanctions are called a reaction and boosting the military might of the world’s strongest bloc is called a reply to aggression,” the Russian senator wrote.

The policy of Western sanctions and White House claims of chemical weapons stored in Damascus also add to this twisted reality in which Russia is portrayed as a threat to democracy, he added.

Kosachev said that the spreading of propaganda myths had already helped Baltic nations to join the European Union and NATO before many of the Balkan states, and became a state-building principle for modern Ukraine.

“The only way to fight this is to reply to all speculation about ‘Russia’s intentions’ by explanations of the real motives and objectives of [Western] foreign policy,” Kosachev wrote.

“The demagogy about attacks on values and freedoms should be countered with the truth about the geopolitical motives of Western nations’ actions. This is not a simple task, but it is manageable.”

According to Amber Lyon, a three-time Emmy award winning journalist, CNN is routinely paid by the US government and foreign governments to selectively report on certain events and make up fake news stories.

Furthermore, the Obama administration pay CNN for editorial control over some of their content.

Redflagnews.com report:

Back in March 2011, CNN sent a four person team to Bahrain to cover the Arab Spring. Once there, the crew was the subject of extreme intimidation amongst other things, but they were able to record some fantastic footage. As Glenn Greenwald of the UK’s Guardian writes in his blockbuster article from September 4th 2012:

“In the segment, Lyon interviewed activists as they explicitly described their torture at the hands of government forces, while family members recounted their relatives’ abrupt disappearances. She spoke with government officials justifying the imprisonment of activists. And the segment featured harrowing video footage of regime forces shooting unarmed demonstrators, along with the mass arrests of peaceful protesters. In sum, the early 2011 CNN segment on Bahrain presented one of the starkest reports to date of the brutal repression embraced by the US-backed regime.

Despite these accolades, and despite the dangers their own journalists and their sources endured to produce it, CNN International (CNNi) never broadcast the documentary. Even in the face of numerous inquiries and complaints from their own employees inside CNN, it continued to refuse to broadcast the program or even provide any explanation for the decision. To date, this documentary has never aired on CNNi.

Having just returned from Bahrain, Lyon says she “saw first-hand that these regime claims were lies, and I couldn’t believe CNN was making me put what I knew to be government lies into my reporting.”

Here is a segment of the Bahrain report that Amber Lyon and her team put together. CNNi refused to allow it to air because the Bahrain Government had paid them not to show it.

When Amber Lyon recognized the extent of the reasoning, she challenged CNN. CNN told her to be quiet, and began to view her as a risk. She knew, and found out, too much.

Amber is now trying to tell the story, the real story, of what is going on behind the closed doors of US Media entities. Amber has created her own website, and additionally as noted in the Guardian Article she is trying to share the truth of the deceptions.

What Amber Lyon describes is exactly the reason why CNN never aired the Nick Robertson interview with Muhammed Al Zawahiri in Egypt.

Amber recently did a web interview with Alex Jones on InfoWars. Generally the TreeHouse does not appreciate Alex Jones. He is wound up tighter than piano wire, and unfortunately much of his truth is diminished because of the hype he places upon it.

Alex Jones is easy to disregard as a “conspiracy theorist”, not because of what he says, but because of how he says it. Everything is desperate and dangerous with him.

That said, the words and explanations of Ms. Lyon in the discussion/interview are poignant and vastly informative. So I share the video with you so you can hear from Amber herself exactly what is being described and articulated.

It is critical to listen to what she says, not just about Bahrain but also about what the Obama administration is specifically doing.

Japan has announced plans to dump 920,000 tons of deadly Fukushima nuclear waste into the Pacific ocean, saying that they can no longer contain the waste on land.

Following the major tsunami in 2011 that resulted the reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant shutting down, the constant leaking of radiation that has occurred in the aftermath has been dubbed one of the worst nuclear disasters since Chernobyl.

Newstarget.com reports: Six years after the disaster, the three crippled reactors are still leaking water with high levels of radiation into the Pacific Ocean. Though the Pacific Ocean is a vast stretch of water, Fukushima’s radiation is reaching the coast of the United States, Canada, and Mexico, contaminating the fish we eat and the water we swim in.

While these findings were first considered “fake news” and laughed away, researchers can no longer deny that Cesium-134, the so-called fingerprint of Fukushima, has been found in seawater and fish along the Western Coast of the Americas.

In TRT’s daily news show “Insight,” hosted by former Sky News presenter Martin Stanford, the head of international atomic energy agency has called on the world to help with the cleanup of the Fukushima site.

Japan fails to clean up the mess, plotting to discharge nuclear waste into the ocean

Ever since the tsunami put the Fukushima plant out of business, one of the ongoing core tasks has been to cool the reactors and prevent the release of highly contaminated water leaking from the three units. Though it has been six years since the disaster, the cleanup is making slow progress.

Mark Whitby, chairman and design director of the engineering and consultancy firm WME Consultants, explained that today about 400 tons of water go into each reactor to cool it. Part of the highly radioactive water is recycled to re-cool the reactors, and the rest goes into big tanks, which are stacking up at a fast rate. As reported by TRT, Japan is running out of storage space. There are currently about a 1,000 storage tanks holding 920,000 tons of contaminated water.

As if the marine life isn’t struggling enough already by the vast amounts of plastic in the oceans, the Japanese are now talking about dumping these tanks with nuclear wastewater directly into the sea because they cannot keep building and storing these reservoirs, Whitby told TRT.

Also, to this day researchers are uncertain whether the melted cores are still within the containment structures or if they have burrowed through the vessels, contaminating the groundwater that ends up in the Pacific Ocean. Since many robots, sent out to assess the damage, have been destroyed due to the high levels of radiation that melts their electronics, it is tough to get this information.

Recently, however, one camera lasted long enough to show that molten core debris has burned through the bottom of the inner reactor wall. The radioactive debris is now burrowed deep into the foundations of the reactor, causing the highest radiation levels measured around the reactor since the triple core meltdown six years ago. Until these cores can be retrieved, the reactors will keep leaking radioactive material into the groundwater.

According to Japan’s former prime minister, the current Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is lying about the situation being under control. Abe has also been criticized for forcing more than 6,000 people to return to their home in areas that are still highly contaminated zones.

According to the Japanese government, Japan will be safe by 2020. Therefore, it will hold the Olympic baseball and softball in the Fukushima area to show “Japan is cool,” even if their reactors are still posing a serious threat.

The world's largest airborne space observatory has touched down in Christchurch for a second season.

Photo: NASA

NASA's Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) will conduct 17 flights over the next six weeks.

The €80 million telescope operates from the back of a converted jumbo jet, which flies for 10 hours each mission.

The plane is usually based at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center in Palmdale, California, but touched down in Christchurch last night for a second season.

Photo: NASA

The project is a joint venture between NASA which runs the programme and the DLR (German Aerospace Centre) which built the telescope.

DLR's telescope chief engineer Heinz Hammes said the possibilities with the telescope were endless.

"It is priceless, it is the only telescope of its kind in the world."

He said by flying at 45,000 feet the telescope provided access to things in space that would otherwise be blocked from water vapour.

"It can see the Milky Way Galaxy, young stars, star forming regions and several nearby galaxies."

Mission operations manager Edward Harmon said the clear, cold conditions in New Zealand were perfect for observing space.

"Some of the things we are looking for, we can not see in the Northern Hemisphere, and the atmosphere here is as close to space as we have ever seen."

Photo: RNZ / Sally Murphy

Mr Harmon said this year there was a focus on observing Pluto.

"Scientists want to gain a better understanding of the atmosphere around the planet, so they can study planet formation."

He said funding for the programme was currently under the US Senate, so its future was not guaranteed.

"We are nervous SOFIA has been through its ups and downs, but I am optimistic."

SOFIA's first flight is on Wednesday night and the progamme runs until 24 July.

An unknown, unseen "planetary mass object" may lurk in the outer reaches of our solar system, according to new research on the orbits of minor planets to be published in the Astronomical Journal. This object would be different from — and much closer than — the so-called Planet Nine, a planet whose existence yet awaits confirmation.

In the paper, Kat Volk and Renu Malhotra of the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, or LPL, present compelling evidence of a yet-to-be- discovered planetary body with a mass somewhere between that of Mars and Earth. The mysterious mass, the authors show, has given away its presence — for now — only by controlling the orbital planes of a population of space rocks known as Kuiper Belt objects, or KBOs, in the icy outskirts of the solar system.

While most KBOs — debris left over from the formation of the solar system — orbit the sun with orbital tilts (inclinations) that average out to what planetary scientists call the invariable plane of the solar system, the most distant of the Kuiper Belt's objects do not. Their average plane, Volk and Malhotra discovered, is tilted away from the invariable plane by about eight degrees. In other words, something unknown is warping the average orbital plane of the outer solar system.

"The most likely explanation for our results is that there is some unseen mass," says Volk, a postdoctoral fellow at LPL and the lead author of the study. "According to our calculations, something as massive as Mars would be needed to cause the warp that we measured."

The Kuiper Belt lies beyond the orbit of Neptune and extends to a few hundred Astronomical Units, or AU, with one AU representing the distance between Earth and the sun. Like its inner solar system cousin, the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, the Kuiper Belt hosts a vast number of minor planets, mostly small icy bodies (the precursors of comets), and a few dwarf planets.

For the study, Volk and Malhotra analyzed the tilt angles of the orbital planes of more than 600 objects in the Kuiper Belt in order to determine the common direction about which these orbital planes all precess. Precession refers to the slow change or "wobble" in the orientation of a rotating object.

KBOs operate in an analogous way to spinning tops, explains Malhotra, who is a Louise Foucar Marshall Science Research Professor and Regents' Professor of Planetary Sciences at LPL.

"Imagine you have lots and lots of fast-spinning tops, and you give each one a slight nudge," she says. "If you then take a snapshot of them, you will find that their spin axes will be at different orientations, but on average, they will be pointing to the local gravitational field of Earth.

"We expect each of the KBOs' orbital tilt angle to be at a different orientation, but on average, they will be pointing perpendicular to the plane determined by the sun and the big planets."

If one were to think of the average orbital plane of objects in the outer solar system as a sheet, it should be quite flat past 50 AU, according to Volk.

"But going further out from 50 to 80 AU, we found that the average plane actually warps away from the invariable plane," she explains. "There is a range of uncertainties for the measured warp, but there is not more than 1 or 2 percent chance that this warp is merely a statistical fluke of the limited observational sample of KBOs."

In other words, the effect is most likely a real signal rather than a statistical fluke. According to the calculations, an object with the mass of Mars orbiting roughly 60 AU from the sun on an orbit tilted by about eight degrees (to the average plane of the known planets) has sufficient gravitational influence to warp the orbital plane of the distant KBOs within about 10 AU to either side.

"The observed distant KBOs are concentrated in a ring about 30 AU wide and would feel the gravity of such a planetary mass object over time," Volk said, "so hypothesizing one planetary mass to cause the observed warp is not unreasonable across that distance."

This rules out the possibility that the postulated object in this case could be the hypothetical Planet Nine, whose existence has been suggested based on other observations. That planet is predicted to be much more massive (about 10 Earth masses) and much farther out at 500 to 700 AU.

"That is too far away to influence these KBOs," Volk said. "It certainly has to be much closer than 100 AU to substantially affect the KBOs in that range."

Because a planet, by definition, has to have cleared its orbit of minor planets such as KBOs, the authors refer to the hypothetical mass as a planetary mass object. The data also do not rule out the possibility that the warp could result from more than one planetary mass object.

So why haven't we found it yet? Most likely, according to Malhotra and Volk, because we haven't yet searched the entire sky for distant solar system objects. The most likely place a planetary mass object could be hiding would be in the galactic plane, an area so densely packed with stars that solar system surveys tend to avoid it.

"The chance that we have not found such an object of the right brightness and distance simply because of the limitations of the surveys is estimated to be to about 30 percent," Volk said.

A possible alternative to an unseen object that could have ruffled the plane of outer Kuiper Belt objects could be a star that buzzed the solar system in recent (by astronomical standards) history, the authors said.

"A passing star would draw all the 'spinning tops' in one direction," Malhotra said. “Once the star is gone, all the KBOs will go back to precessing around their previous plane. That would have required an extremely close passage at about 100 AU, and the warp would be erased within 10 million years, so we don't consider this a likely scenario."

Humankind's chance to catch a glimpse of the mysterious object might come fairly soon once construction of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope is completed. Run by a consortium that includes the UA and scheduled for first light in 2020, the instrument will take unprecedented, real-time surveys of the sky, night after night.

"We expect LSST to bring the number of observed KBOs from currently about 2000 to 40,000," Malhotra said. "There are a lot more KBOs out there — we just have not seen them yet. Some of them are too far and dim even for LSST to spot, but because the telescope will cover the sky much more comprehensively than current surveys, it should be able to detect this object, if it's out there."

The British High Court is seriously considering prosecuting former Prime Minister Tony Blair over the illegal war in Iraq.

The Iraq war was unnecessary and went against United Nations law, Michael Manfield QC told the high court in an opening statement on Wednesday.

Mansfield represents former Iraqi general Abdulwaheed al-Rabbat, who wishes to seek justice for the millions of Iraqi citizens needlessly killed since the war began in 2003.

The Guardian reports: Rabbat, said Mansfield, was motivated by last year’s publication of the report of the Chilcot inquiry into the 2003 Iraq war.

Mansfield summarised the report’s findings as: “Saddam Hussein did not pose an urgent threat to the UK, intelligence reporting about [Iraqi] weapons of mass destruction was presented with unwarranted certainty, that the war was unnecessary and that the UK undermined the authority of the UN security council.”

“Nothing could be more emphatic than these findings,” he said. “It was an unlawful war.”

Mansfield argued that when the British prosecutor, Sir Hartley Shawcross, opened the cases against Nazi leaders at the Nuremburg war crimes trials at the end of the second world war, he acted as though the crime of aggression had already been assimilated into English law.

An initial application to launch the prosecution was dismissed at Westminster magistrates court on the grounds that Blair enjoys immunity and that the crime of aggression does not exist in English law.

The court was told that attempts to persuade the international criminal court to prosecute to the former Labour prime minister for invading Iraq have made no significant progress.

The crime of aggression was finally defined in 2010 by the ICC, the high court heard, but it has not yet been ratified by a sufficient number of states.

The high court appeal is being heard by the lord chief justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, and Mr Justice Ouseley.

The current attorney general, Jeremy Wright QC, has intervened in the case to argue that the crime does not exist in the statute book. “The crime of aggression is not known to English law,” James Eadie QC, for the attorney general, told the court.

He also relied on a 2006 House of Lords ruling, R v Jones, which unanimously found that the international law crime of aggression is not an offence under domestic legislation in the UK.

A number of Iraqi supporters of Rabbat sat at the back of the court. Speaking before the hearing started, Sabah al-Mukhtar, of the Arab Lawyers Network, said: “This is just looking at whether the first court was right in refusing to entertain the case.

“The magistrates court dismissed it on the grounds that Tony Blair had immunity and that the crime of aggression was not part of English law. Many think they were not correct on that.”

Rabbat, a former chief of staff of the Iraqi army, was not in court. He currently lives in the Omani capital, Muscat; he is said not even to own a passport.

His lawyers said he has been able to bring the case in British courts because the UK previously occupied Iraq. Under the European Convention on Human Rights he is therefore deemed to have been within the jurisdiction at a relevant time.

The high court reserved its decision and allowed a further week for Rabbat’s lawyers to make additional specified submissions. If the judges do not dismiss the appeal, the issue of whether the crime of aggression exists in English law will be sent up to the supreme court to decide.

Konstantin Kosachev, the head of the upper house Committee for International Relations, says that the Western media has distorted information about Russia’s intentions, using it as a weapon in their information war.

The Russian Senator has called for reporters to disclose their real motives in order to debunk the myth of a ‘Russian danger’ that is circulating in the media.

RT reports:

In an article published in the popular daily Izvestia on Tuesday, Senator Konstantin Kosachev wrote that the Western mass media distorted information about Russia’s intentions as the main weapon in their information war.

The main objective behind this is the creation of a myth that portrays Russia as an aggressor nation, the senator added.

“Thanks to all these Orwellian statements we are now living in some sort of an inside-out reality. In which unanimous informational baiting is called an anti-propaganda campaign, sanctions are called a reaction and boosting the military might of the world’s strongest bloc is called a reply to aggression,” the Russian senator wrote.

The policy of Western sanctions and White House claims of chemical weapons stored in Damascus also add to this twisted reality in which Russia is portrayed as a threat to democracy, he added.

Kosachev said that the spreading of propaganda myths had already helped Baltic nations to join the European Union and NATO before many of the Balkan states, and became a state-building principle for modern Ukraine.

“The only way to fight this is to reply to all speculation about ‘Russia’s intentions’ by explanations of the real motives and objectives of [Western] foreign policy,” Kosachev wrote.

“The demagogy about attacks on values and freedoms should be countered with the truth about the geopolitical motives of Western nations’ actions. This is not a simple task, but it is manageable.”

Germany has voted to fine social media networks such as Facebook up to $56 million each time they continue allowing ‘conspiracy theories’ to be spread online.

Facebook, Twitter, and other large social media sites will be given just 24 hours to remove content deemed offensive or ‘hateful’ – otherwise face huge fines as a consequence.

The bill was rushed through German parliament, just 2 months ahead of the German elections in which Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel is predicted to face an embarrassing defeat over to her failed immigration policies.

“Freedom of speech ends where criminal law begins,” Justice Minister Heiko Maas said in response to criticism of the new Orwellian law.

Rt.com reports: The companies will have to publish a report every six months, describing in detail how they have dealt with complaints of hate speech on their platforms, the bill suggests.

According to Maas, who proposed the bill back in March, the number of hate crimes in Germany jumped by over 300 percent in the last two years.

“This law is the logical next step for effectively tackling hate speech since all voluntary agreements with the platform providers have been virtually unsuccessful,” the Central Council of Jews in Germany said, praising the measure, as cited by Reuters.

However, the companies affected, including Facebook, did not welcome the bill, saying it could crack down on free speech.

“This law as it stands now will not improve efforts to tackle this important social problem,” a Facebook statement said.

“We feel that the lack of scrutiny and consultation do not do justice to the importance of the subject. We will continue to do everything we can to ensure safety for the people on our platform.”

A Facebook spokesperson told RT in an emailed statement that the company has always viewed hate speech as a serious issue, but does not believe that the German law can “improve efforts to tackle this important societal problem.”

“We share the goal of the German government to fight hate speech. We have been working hard on this problem and have made substantial progress in removing illegal content,” the statement read.

Facebook said it was adding 3,000 people to its community operations team, on top of the 4,500 it already has, and was “building better tools to keep our community safe.”

“We believe the best solutions will be found when government, civil society and industry work together and that this law as it stands now will not improve efforts to tackle this important societal problem. We feel that the lack of scrutiny and consultation do not do justice to the importance of the subject,” it added.

In the “background points” provided with the statement, Facebook said that the law was criticized by legal experts for being rushed through parliament despite contradicting the German constitution and EU laws.

According to the company, the legislation would allow deleting “content that is not clearly illegal” and shift complex legal decision-making from the government to tech firms.

In May Reporters Without Borders said the group “fears censorship resulting from German law on online hate content.”

“RSF opposes this bill, which would just contribute to the trend to privatize censorship by delegating the duties of judges to commercial online platforms and making them decide where or not content should be deleted, as if the Internet giants can replace independent and impartial courts,” said Elodie Vialle, the head of RSF’s Journalism and Technology desk.

Two people who were connected to the Flint water company investigation were both found dead in the space of a week this month.

Water Treatment Plant Foreman, Matthew McFarland, and the woman leading the lead poisoning suit, Sasha Avonna Bell, were found dead within days of each other.

Vigilantcitizen.com reports:

The Flint water crisis began exactly two years ago, on April 2014, when Flint changed its water source from treated Detroit Water and Sewerage Department water to the Flint River – to which officials had failed to apply corrosion inhibitors. Almost immediately, Flint residents complained about the water’s color, taste and odor. In the following months, numerous water issues arose, with little to no governmental action to fix them.

August and September 2014 boil-water advisories were issued by the city due to coliform bacteria detection

On August 21, 2014 test showed the city’s water tested high for THMs, a chlorine byproduct of disinfecting water, with which long term exposure has been linked to cancer and other diseases.

Though the city stated that the water was safe, the employees of the Flint Public Library declared the water undrinkable after noticing that the water from the faucets and toilets was discolored.

On March 2, 2016, it was reported that the state of Michigan blocked Flint from returning to Lake Huron water from the Detroit water system when it agreed to grant the city an emergency loan of $7 million in April 2015

It was discovered that the high levels of lead were due to orthophosphate being omitted from the water treatment process, while using a pH of 7.4 and that the orange water was due to the high concentration of chloride in the Flint River water, which caused excessive corrosion of the cast iron mains pipes.

Far from taking decisive action, governments denied that the water was toxic.

While the local outcry about Flint water quality was growing in early 2015, Flint water officials filed papers with state regulators purporting to show that “tests at Flint’s water treatment plant had detected no lead and testing in homes had registered lead at acceptable levels.” The documents falsely claimed that the city had tested tap water from homes with lead service lines, and therefore the highest lead-poisoning risks; in reality; the city does not know the locations of lead service lines, which city officials acknowledged in November 2015 after the Flint Journal/MLive published an article revealing the practice after obtaining documents through the Michigan Freedom of Information Act.

The net result is that over 10,000 children (mostly Black) were exposed to water contaminated with lead. Lead poisoning has devastating effects on the brain:

Childhood lead exposure causes a reduction in intellectual functioning and IQ, academic performance, and problem-solving skills, and an increased risk of attention deficit disorder, aggression, and hyperactivity. According to studies, children with elevated levels of lead in the blood are more likely as adults to commit crimes, be imprisoned, be unemployed or underemployed, or be dependent on government services.

– Julie Mack, Lead levels elevated for thousands of Michigan children outside of Flint

A massive investigation is now underway and lawsuits are being filed. And things are turning uglier.

Cover Up

Now that the federal government opened an investigation on the issue, news emerging from Flint are downright sordid.

First, in March, important documents went missing, the police openly admits that it was an inside job, and that the crime will most likely remain unresolved.

Days before the federal government opened an investigation into the Flint water crisis, someone broke into a vacant City Hall office full of documents related to the embattled Michigan city’s water system.

Nearly three months later, officials have confirmed that a TV went missing, but little else is known, according to the Flint Journal.

Without suspects or a firm handle on what else may have been swiped, authorities told the paper last week that the crime may remain unsolved.

No warrants have been issued in the case, but officials don’t shy away from speculative statements that stop just short of conspiracy theories.

“It was definitely an inside job,” police chief Tim Johnson told the Journal. “The power cord (to the TV) wasn’t even taken. The average drug user knows that you’d need the power cord to be able to pawn it.”

“It was somebody that had knowledge of those documents that really wanted to keep them out of the right hands, out of the hands of someone who was going to tell the real story of what’s going on with Flint water.”

On April 16th, Water Treatment Plant Foreman Matthew McFarland (who had been interviewed regarding the water crisis) was found dead at the young age of 43. Cause of death? Unknown.

Already reeling from the news of criminal charges against one of its workers in the wake of the Flint water crisis, city workers are now dealing with the sudden death of a foreman at the plant.

Water Treatment Plant Foreman Matthew McFarland, 43, of Otter Lake died suddenly on on Saturday, April 16, according to his obituary.

The Lapeer County Sheriff’s Department said a friend found McFarland unresponsive at a home in Otter Lake. There were no signs of foul play.

An autopsy did not determine a cause of death and police are awaiting toxicology reports. The investigation remains open.

“My thoughts and prayers go out to Matt’s co-workers, his family and especially his children,” said Flint Mayor Karen Weaver. “He worked for the City of Flint for more than 18 years and we thank him for his devotion and service.”

“We all have been brought together by this water crisis and we are all mourning his death,” Weaver said in a statement. “In lieu of flowers, the family has expressed they would appreciate donations to establish a fund for (his children) Vance and Ella’s college expenses.”

McFarland’s death comes as Flint’s water plant deals with news that Flint Utilities Manager Michael Glasgow is one of three men facing criminal charges in connection with the city’s water crisis.

Glasgow is accused of tampering with evidence when he allegedly changed testing results to show there was less lead in city water than there actually was. He is also charged with willful neglect of office.

Michigan Department of Environmental Quality employees Stephen Busch and Michael Prysby are charged with misconduct in office, conspiracy to tamper with evidence, tampering with evidence and violations of the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act.

Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette’s office confirmed that McFarland was previously interviewed as part of its ongoing investigation into the city’s water crisis.

A few days later, a 19-year old woman leading the Flint water crisis lawsuit was found shot dead in her home. A culprit was arrested. Was he a patsy?

A woman at the center of a bellwether Flint water crisis lawsuit was one of two women who were shot to death inside a townhouse earlier this week.

Sasha Avonna Bell was one of the first of a growing number of people to file a lawsuit in connection to the Flint water crisis after she claimed that her child had been lead poisoned.

Bell was found dead April 19 in the 2600 block of Ridgecrest Drive at the Ridgecrest Village Townhouses. Sacorya Renee Reed was also found shot to death in the home.

An unharmed 1-year-old child was also found inside of the Ridgecrest home when Bell’s body was discovered and was taken into custody by child protective services. Police declined to confirm if it was Bell’s child discovered in the home.

“Sasha was a lovely young woman who cared deeply for her family, and especially for her young child,” said her attorney Corey M. Stern. “Her tragic and senseless death has created a void in the lives of so many people that loved her. Hopefully, her child will be lifted up by the love and support from everyone who cared deeply for Sasha.”

Bell’s case was one of 64 lawsuits filed on behalf of 144 children by Stern’s firm, New York-based Levy Konigsberg, and Flint-based Robinson Carter & Crawford.

The lawsuit named six companies that had various responsibilities with respect to the treatment, monitoring, and safety of the Flint water prior to and during the Flint water crisis, according to her attorneys. The case also named three individual government, or former government, employees who played significant roles in the alleged misconduct that led to the alleged poisoning of thousands of children in Flint, her attorneys claim.

The Bell case, however, played an important role in determining the future of the more than five dozen other lawsuits that were filed.

Everything about this story is revolting and dirty facts are emerging from everywhere. However, mass media largely ignores this story. Those that do are flooded with comments about “tin foil hats” and “conspiracy nutters”. It is as if shills are paid kill that story online … or maybe that poisonous lead has already done its debilitating, mind-numbing job.

An ex illuminati member has penned a letter outlining the plans the secret society has in store for humanity in the next few years.

After spending 47 years as a high-ranking illuminati member, the anonymous insider says that he wants to “reveal everything” after the burden of keeping it a secret became “too much to bear”.

In an online post the ‘illuminati insider’ reveals:

The process you have to go through in order to become a member

Shocking revelations about who Obama really is (he is much more evil than anyone realises apparently)

Information about ‘Space flights’ program

How dark and satanic Denver, Colorado really is

The truth about aliens

This post will be about how the Illuminati recruited me and what exactly I had to go through.

When I was nineteen years old, I fell into some money through some connections with friends and some successful investments of some money that I had made throughout my childhood. I got involved in some backroom deals and saw my money begin to grow. As I attended college at Harvard in 1964, I begin to become increasingly rich, and my influence on campus grew as well through my participation in various clubs, and organizations. Some friends and I began to serve as quasi-stock brokers while still at Harvard. I made tons of cash during that year, and was very powerful and influential on campus.

One night as I was walking back to my dorm shortly after midnight, I was approached by two men in black suits. I initially assumed that they were going to investigate my business activity because some of it was not exactly legal. They asked me to come with them and I followed them into the basement of a two story house a couple streets over from my dorm room. They sat me down at a table and asked me if I was willing to make a deal. They would not tell me what deal I would be making, but just continually asked if I would be willing to make a deal. I half-assed agreed that I would, and that is when the biggest man that I have ever seen walked through some closet doors and sat down First of all, if you do not believe me then I am sorry. I am here to tell the truth, and nothing that is written by me is false exaggeration nor science fiction. This information is real, it is true, it is reality, and it is time for it to be told.

I was a member of the Illuminati for 47 years. I was recruited when I was 19 years old. I have posted here off and on over the past year. (Some of the posts are mine, others are my brothers, mainly they are his) The information that I am about to unfold is very revealing and very dangerous. I am one of seven people in the history of the Illuminati that have performed the “Departure” Ritual. I knew that I needed to get out when I had something revealed to me at a meeting in June of 2010. For years I was in line with the beliefs, motives, and actions of the Illuminati, but it recently became too much for me to bear, and I had to extinguish my sacred contract.

My reason for coming here is to reveal EVERYTHING about the Illuminati. How you become a member, what the organization is about, what the organization does, and the future plans that we have.

I will be back to make my first post when I can see that this thread has enough attention for me continue. Any time in the near future when I begin to reveal the secrets of the Illuminati, I need to ensure that there are enough people paying attention so that my efforts do not go to waste.

Once I see that this thread has a substantial amount of views and replies, I will make my first post.

Here is a preview of some of the things that I will reveal:

Barack Obama is not a member of the Illuminati, he is something much, much worse.

The new “space flights” which are planes that can briefly enter orbit are not as fun as they seem, they are an Illuminati tool.

Denver, Colorado is an evil place

Aliens are a little different than what mainstream teaches us

The information I have is essential!

page 69 of thread:

The first topic to discuss will be these underground bunkers that I have mentioned. Currently, there are 57 underground bases and bunkers around the United States that are in use for various purposes. There are 439 bunkers in the entire world. ALL of these bunkers and bases are controlled and maintained by the Illuminati. The largest underground bunker is in Sao Paulo, Brazil. This bunker has the capability of holding up to 5,000 people for a period of up to ten years. I have personally been in this bunker, and it is much larger than one that anyone can possible even imagine. This bunker is secured mainly for the events of the end times. 5,000 of the world’s richest, brightest, and most powerful individuals will secure shelter in this bunker in the event of a global thermonuclear war, natural disaster, or any other form of global catastrophe. Don’t be confused. Several other bunkers have the ability of housing large numbers of people for extended periods of time, but no other bunkers is as large and capable as this one. In the event of World War 3, all of the world’s leaders will take shelter here, and the governments of the world will be theoretical proxy governments. The world’s richest people will be here as well. People such as Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, the oil tycoons ( however, these oil tycoons will be murdered while they are in the bunker so that the takeover of the Middle East will be much easier for the New World Order). I do not know the exact number, but of the 439 bunkers in the world, I would say that around 275 of them are constructed mainly for shelter and extended stays. I myself stayed in one of these bunkers while in China in the nineties. They are very nice, very luxurious. It is practically like you are staying in a 5 star hotel.

Some people that have stayed in these bunkers:

Leon Trotsky: After Stalin defeated Trotsky and secured power in the Soviet Union following Lenin’s death, Trotsky was moved to an underground bunker just inside Switzerland. Stalin originally did not know about this because if he did not follow the orders of the Illuminati, then Trotsky was going to be reinstated as the leader of the Soviet Union. It was important to have Trotsky placed in this bunker because Stalin was going to kill him otherwise. Stalin eventually fell in line with the Illuminati’s plans, and Trotsky was executed because he was no longer needed.

Abraham Lincoln: Lincoln was NOT murdered by John Wilkes Booth. Lincoln was placed in the office of presidency as a pawn. The Illuminati knew that if he was elected then the South would secede. The Civil War made the North very, very rich. That was the only reason the Civil War was allowed to happen. If the Illuminati had not seen the opportunity to become rich off of the war, then slavery would still be an American institution. Lincoln was placed in office just to start the war. He made a deal that once the war was over, that he would be removed from office. This was taken care of through a fake assassination, and he spent the rest of his days in a bunker in Mexico.

Saddam Hussein: Hussein was in power in Iraq merely to raise justification for invasion by the United States and other nations. Many of you are already familiar with what I have said about the plans to entirely take over the Middle East and to secure the oil that is currently untapped. The Hussein that was “hung” was a dummy, and the cell phone video that was release was meant to be released as “proof.” Saddam is currently in a bunker somewhere in Argentina. I do not know of any future plans with him.

The rest of the bunkers in the world are used for storage of things that cannot be stored on top of the ground. Nuclear stockpiles are being held in these underground bunkers . In the event that a nation veers off the course that is planned, then they will be eliminated. Either through assassination of their leaders or by nuclear destruction. Thankfully, nuclear action has not had to be taken yet; however, do not put it past these people to bring about such destruction.

You all know about the HAARP machine conspiracy. It is real. I can assure you. The machine is housed entirely in a bunker that is underwater in the Pacific Ocean. This machine was developed back in the 1980’s, and was first used in the late nineties. This machine has capability of creating any natural disaster that the Illuminati wish to create. Hurricane Katrina was a product of the HAARP machine. The Hurricane was used as a diversion. While the area was in chaos, and attention was diverted everywhere, engineers were sent down to prepare for the gulf oil spill. I can assure you that the Illuminati is capable of releasing more oil into the gulf. The oil that has already been pumped into the gulf is only a small amount compared to what could possibly be done. I already mentioned that the oil spill was used as an agent to implant microbodies into the brains of the children in the area. These children that have been affected are now subject to government control whenever these microbodies are activated. The Illuminati also used the opportunity that Katrina presented to build a bunker that is directly beneath the French Quarter. Why else do you think that FEMA was slow to provide adequate assistance? The engineers needed time.

The HAARP machine is not controlled by any one single country; it is collectively controlled and used. The earthquake in Haiti, the ones that happened over the past couple days, all are products of the HAARP. Not all of the events are relevant or important, some are just tests, some are even mistakes. Rest assured however that once there is need for a natural disaster, the disaster can be generated, engineered, and directed and have whatever effect is necessary.

Another thing that is housed in these bunkers are drugs. There are massive amounts of cocaine, marijuana, heroine, and all kinds of other drugs being stored. The drug trade and war on drugs are essential to the Illuminati. As more and more drugs are traded and cartels become more powerful, the Illuminati becomes richer and more powerful. One of the major contributors and benefactors to the drug trade is Warren Buffett. Buffett has been running the drug trade in the Western Hemisphere for the past twenty years. The drug cartels of Mexico are under his power. It is important that the Illuminati control the majority of the drugs in North America. This is because it gives them yet another vehicle to transport technology that allows them to take control of the consumers. The Illuminati is constantly searching for ways to implant themselves in the minds of the general public, and naturally, control of the drug trade was the perfect way to do so. Buffett secured control of the drug trade when he approached multiple drug cartels and presented them with contracts. He has been in control ever since, and Ben Bernanke is assisting him with the day to day operations.

Multiple bunkers are also equipped to serve as crematories. Much in the same way that the Nazis burned their victims, the Illuminati plans to burn victims that are killed off. Many have speculated that FEMA has constructed stockpiles of coffins to be used for mass burials, but this is not true. Mass burials would take a massive amount of time and effort. Therefore, when the time comes to begin mass killings and executions, the bodies will be shipped to “burn yard” where they will be dropped in these bunkers and reduced to ashes. FEMA, which is an Illuminati run organization, decided that this would be the most effective way to dispose of a mass amount of bodies.

Yet more of these bunkers contain robots that are designed and ready to infiltrate the workplace in the case of a labor shortage. The scenario in which these robots will most likely be used is when the mind control aspect of the Illuminati’s plan goes into effect. Robots will be sent in to perform the jobs that these people were doing, and these people will be used for other events, such as war, propaganda, and violence. These robots will also be used once population control goes into effect.

Alex Jones is not who he says he is. For years he has been working to uncover the secrets of the Illuminati and the New World Order, but yet he is a member of the former, and will be in power in the latter. Jones has been placed in the world of conspiracy theories to feed false information, to throw trackers off the trail. Do not believe anything that the man tells you. All of the information that he presents is fabricated by the Illuminati, for the Illuminati. Think of Joseph Goebbels. Alex Jones is the perfect Joseph Goebbels. STOP LISTENING TO HIM IF YOU ARE. You are being lied to by a man that receives his instructions straight from the Illuminati.

The moon landing in 1969 was real, but there was a moon landing seven years earlier that was the first real landing. In truth, the Russians were the first ones to land on the moon; however, they did not publicize the mission nor the results. It was decided that America was going to win the space race in order to secure a feeling of capitalism over communism. Russia launched their own rocket ship toward the moon as a test run to ensure that the American trial would be successful seven years later. Everything went perfect with the Russian moon landing, and the same technology was then applied to the American moon mission. While on the moon, the American astronauts began the first construction of nuclear missile sites on the moon. These nuclear missile sites have been added onto over the years by way of subsequent moon missions and work by remote control robots. The purpose of these missile sites is the ability to launch nuclear missiles without the risk of tracing the missiles back to a particular country. The scenario in which these missiles would be used is to attack a nation that is not cooperating with the Illuminati. The Illuminati would order missiles launched at the nation, but without the afflicted nation being able to track where exactly the missiles came from, they would not be able to show evidence that they should declare war on a specific country. In my opinion, these missiles will never be used because there are many other ways that the Illuminati can bring down an entire government other than nuking them. However, to my knowledge, the moon currently has 2 fully equipped nuclear missile sites that can be operated from Earth.

Sticking with space….

Scientists working for the Illuminati have found a way that they can “shut” off the sun. A weapon has been created that shoot a beam of high density radiation right into the heart of a planet or star. This beam of radiation penetrates through the planet creating a very large cylinder in the exact middle of it. The radiation that is left behind begins to eat at the star or planet and the effects spread like wildfire. This technology has been tested on various stars in our immediate solar system and is very effective. The first thing that occurs to the star is that the radiation eats a perfect cylinder through the middle of the star, the radiation left behind begins working its way outward degenerating anything in its path. The radiation continues to build and spread. Some stars hung on until they were totally deteriorated from the radiation; however, some stars became so unstable that they combusted at a certain point.

Scientists are certain that this technology can be used on the sun, but also on other planets. One estimate that I overheard was that from the initial shot of radiation, it would take approximately nine years for the entire sun to be entirely consumed. We would begin seeing the effects of the radiation in approximately 3 and a half years however. The first signs would be shorter days and a decreased amount of sunlight during those days. The sun would start becoming unstable at about the seven year point, and we will begin seeing massive solar flares. Once the nine years is up, all life on earth will be dead.

Since my departure, I am completely unsure who the top, head leaders of the Illuminati are at this point, but I will give my best guess. The Illuminati is structured so that there are one to three major leaders in each major region of the world; however, some regions are left out because of a lack of a suitable leader; therefore, a leader is installed there.

In North America:

Warren Buffett is most likely the head of all Illuminati operations. Followed by Ben Bernanke, followed by Lloyd Blankfein who is CEO of Goldman Sachs.

Goldman Sachs is a key player in the North American Illuminati sector. Recently, Goldman Sachs invested almost $500 million dollars in Facebook. Usually this means that Facebook will fall under Illuminati control soon, just as Myspace and Twitter have.

Other key players in North America are Alex Jones, Bill Clinton, Rahm Emmanuel, of course Obama, and Timothy Geithner

South America is void of any real Illuminati leaders. Hugo Chavez has been difficult to work with in the past. He seems to be in line with the Illuminati agenda; however, he does not like being told what to do. Most of the North American leaders control South America as well.

In Europe:

Nicolas Sarkozy is the main guy. He controls the majority of the operations in Europe and Africa. Gordon Brown was very influential in the Illuminati until he decided to begin playing his way; this is why he was removed from office. My opinion is that he is still a key player, just not as key as he once was. There are several African arms dealer that have recently gained some power; however, I am unaware of their identities.

The Middle East is controlled largely by Benjamin Netanyahu which should not come as much of a surprise. Netanyahu does not have as much control as you would think however. As I have stated before, Israel is the grand puppet state of the Illuminati.They will do absolutely anything that the Illuminati wants them to do, and they will do it to the best of their ability without even thinking twice. Israel has been given the permission to fire upon Iran whenever it wishes to do so. Control of the Middle East is hard because there are so many rebel groups. Palestine should not even be worried about. Although they are not controlled by the Illuminati, they are not able to do anything. Iran is borderline at time, and completely in opposition at others. This is why Israel will destroy Iran to start WWIII.

Asia is controlled entirely by Vladimir Putin and his cronies. Putin is a very powerful, very smart man. He will regain popular control of Russia very soon, but you can be assured that everything that is happening in Russia right now is going through him. China has chosen to give up a little power to the Illuminati. They cooperate; just do not care to become too involved. In my opinion, it is because they feel that they will be able to defeat the Illuminati in the end. They are sadly mistaken. Eventually they will come to terms and will join in the great skit that will be called World War 3.

The Spanish flu of 1918, SARS, and the H1N1 scare all have one thing in common: they all were engineered by the Illuminati. While nothing has been instituted on a global scale, the Illuminati has been testing these viruses for years and they are finally unlocking the keys to creating a virus that will spread across the globe very, very fast killing select people. My advice: do not receive the vaccines. You will become a part of a test group that the Illuminati is using to experiment. The H1N1 virus started to become widespread when animals escaped from a farm in Brazil where the virus was being tested. Several of these animals mingled with citizens of surrounding towns, and many of the animals were consumed. The population of the surround towns were quarantined, and the ones that died were covered up; however, somehow, a traveler had carried the flu virus all the way up into northern Mexico, where the virus was first reported. The Illuminati soon found out that the virus was much, much less ineffective than they thought. They are currently pursuing research on a virus that will wipe out a country within a matter of days.

I hope this data dump has been informational for you and has contributed to my credibility in some way. I have much, much more information. It just takes me time to sit down and father my thoughts long enough to format them in an easily readable and comprehensive manner. This is definitely not my last post, as I have more information that needs to be told. It has been a long, tiring past couple of days, and I hope this is enough information to give me a good rest for awhile. If you have any questions then feel free to post them here, on my youtube account, or email me at walte1944@yahoo.com

An ex illuminati member has penned a letter outlining the plans the secret society has in store for humanity in the next few years.

After spending 47 years as a high-ranking illuminati member, the anonymous insider says that he wants to “reveal everything” after the burden of keeping it a secret became “too much to bear”.

In an online post the ‘illuminati insider’ reveals:

The process you have to go through in order to become a member

Shocking revelations about who Obama really is (he is much more evil than anyone realises apparently)

Information about ‘Space flights’ program

How dark and satanic Denver, Colorado really is

The truth about aliens

This post will be about how the Illuminati recruited me and what exactly I had to go through.

When I was nineteen years old, I fell into some money through some connections with friends and some successful investments of some money that I had made throughout my childhood. I got involved in some backroom deals and saw my money begin to grow. As I attended college at Harvard in 1964, I begin to become increasingly rich, and my influence on campus grew as well through my participation in various clubs, and organizations. Some friends and I began to serve as quasi-stock brokers while still at Harvard. I made tons of cash during that year, and was very powerful and influential on campus.

One night as I was walking back to my dorm shortly after midnight, I was approached by two men in black suits. I initially assumed that they were going to investigate my business activity because some of it was not exactly legal. They asked me to come with them and I followed them into the basement of a two story house a couple streets over from my dorm room. They sat me down at a table and asked me if I was willing to make a deal. They would not tell me what deal I would be making, but just continually asked if I would be willing to make a deal. I half-assed agreed that I would, and that is when the biggest man that I have ever seen walked through some closet doors and sat down First of all, if you do not believe me then I am sorry. I am here to tell the truth, and nothing that is written by me is false exaggeration nor science fiction. This information is real, it is true, it is reality, and it is time for it to be told.

I was a member of the Illuminati for 47 years. I was recruited when I was 19 years old. I have posted here off and on over the past year. (Some of the posts are mine, others are my brothers, mainly they are his) The information that I am about to unfold is very revealing and very dangerous. I am one of seven people in the history of the Illuminati that have performed the “Departure” Ritual. I knew that I needed to get out when I had something revealed to me at a meeting in June of 2010. For years I was in line with the beliefs, motives, and actions of the Illuminati, but it recently became too much for me to bear, and I had to extinguish my sacred contract.

My reason for coming here is to reveal EVERYTHING about the Illuminati. How you become a member, what the organization is about, what the organization does, and the future plans that we have.

I will be back to make my first post when I can see that this thread has enough attention for me continue. Any time in the near future when I begin to reveal the secrets of the Illuminati, I need to ensure that there are enough people paying attention so that my efforts do not go to waste.

Once I see that this thread has a substantial amount of views and replies, I will make my first post.

Here is a preview of some of the things that I will reveal:

Barack Obama is not a member of the Illuminati, he is something much, much worse.

The new “space flights” which are planes that can briefly enter orbit are not as fun as they seem, they are an Illuminati tool.

Denver, Colorado is an evil place

Aliens are a little different than what mainstream teaches us

The information I have is essential!

page 69 of thread:

The first topic to discuss will be these underground bunkers that I have mentioned. Currently, there are 57 underground bases and bunkers around the United States that are in use for various purposes. There are 439 bunkers in the entire world. ALL of these bunkers and bases are controlled and maintained by the Illuminati. The largest underground bunker is in Sao Paulo, Brazil. This bunker has the capability of holding up to 5,000 people for a period of up to ten years. I have personally been in this bunker, and it is much larger than one that anyone can possible even imagine. This bunker is secured mainly for the events of the end times. 5,000 of the world’s richest, brightest, and most powerful individuals will secure shelter in this bunker in the event of a global thermonuclear war, natural disaster, or any other form of global catastrophe. Don’t be confused. Several other bunkers have the ability of housing large numbers of people for extended periods of time, but no other bunkers is as large and capable as this one. In the event of World War 3, all of the world’s leaders will take shelter here, and the governments of the world will be theoretical proxy governments. The world’s richest people will be here as well. People such as Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, the oil tycoons ( however, these oil tycoons will be murdered while they are in the bunker so that the takeover of the Middle East will be much easier for the New World Order). I do not know the exact number, but of the 439 bunkers in the world, I would say that around 275 of them are constructed mainly for shelter and extended stays. I myself stayed in one of these bunkers while in China in the nineties. They are very nice, very luxurious. It is practically like you are staying in a 5 star hotel.

The Civil War made the North very, very rich. That was the only reason the Civil War was allowed to happen.

He made a deal that once the war was over, that he would be removed from office. This was taken care of through a fake assassination, and he spent the rest of his days in a bunker in Mexico.

In the event that a nation veers off the course that is planned, then they will be eliminated. Either through assassination of their leaders or by nuclear destruction. Thankfully, nuclear action has not had to be taken yet; however, do not put it past these people to bring about such destruction.

A historic lawsuit has been filed in California after a widespread cover-up of Bernie Sanders’ landslide victory at the primary election earlier in the week.

The lawsuit will require the counting of all the provisional ballots, which Sanders says gives him a landslide win in the state.

Justicegazette.org reports:

The theft of California hasn’t deterred Sanders from his course. He has promised to fight on while noting it is a steep uphill climb. Given all the states where vote fraud in favor of Hillary Clinton has been allowed to swing primaries from Sanders to Clinton, it is in fact a steep uphill climb to restore democracy and force the now undemocratic Democratic Party to nominate the man the vast majority of American voters have voted for or tried to vote for.

It has been learned from poll workers that 50% to 90% of voters who were supposed to have been eligible to vote in the Democratic primary were told they would have to vote provisional ballots. There were two irregularities leading to the forced use of provisional ballots instead of regular ballots. The first was that previously registered voters’ names had been removed from the rolls. The second was that someone (in most cases, not the voter) had marked them as vote by mail voters but they had received no ballot in the mail. Oddly, virtually all of those not allowed to vote and forced to vote provisional ballots were Bernie Sanders supporters.

The next oddity is even more curious. Poll workers in Los Angeles and Orange County report that Bernie won the electronic votes in their precincts by well over a 2 to 1 margin, the opposite of the result of the vote count. The contrast between this and the outcome is indicative of vote-flipping. Also the outcome.. outcome does not match what anyone who has conducted polling in this state knows: Below the election night video is a video about black box voting (Hacking Democracy) , The Democratic Party has essentially endorsed this video, showing it at various conventions and another video of a computer programmer confessing to creating a vote-flipping program.

If you add the lower figure of 50% of voters who were not allowed to vote regular ballots for Bernie to the votes he received, you wind up with a substantial Sanders landslide victory in California. The primary beneficiary of the fraud is Hillary Clinton.

As for provisional ballots, acclaimed BBC reporter, author and election fraud expert Greg Palast calls them “placebo ballots.” Greg is the reporter who exposed the voter fraud in Florida in 2000. Nightline used his footage in covering the story. Here is from Greg’s article, “How California is being stolen from Sanders right now.”

“As I’ve previously reported, provisional ballots are “placebo” ballots that let you feel like you’ve voted, but you haven’t. Provisional ballots are generally discarded.”

The Justice Gazette has conducted considerable polling and the official results reflect the opposite of how people said they were going to vote. At the California Democratic Convention most of the elected delegates were “Bernie or Bust.” Ask yourself, when Sanders gets enthusiastic crowds of thousands in California (sixty thousand according to police in Oakland alone) compared to laid- back crowds of hundreds for Clinton, who voted for Clinton? Ask your neighbors, co-workers and fellow students if they voted for her and then start asking how she supposedly won the election without the support of the voters. Or just look at Alameda County (Berkeley, Oakland), where Sanders was greeted by a hundred thousand active supporters, where Clinton is very unpopular and where Clinton’s percentage and Sanders percentage appear to be the exact reversal of what the residents of that county know to be the case. If you walked into any store or group setting, other than a Clinton gathering, and asked who was going to vote for Clinton, you would find that nobody or maybe one or two people would be considering voting for her. Almost all the rest would be planning to vote for Bernie Sanders. We know. At the Justice Gazette, reporters did just that.

Poll workers in Orange and Los Angeles County have reported that Bernie won the electronic votes in their precincts by well over a 2 to 1 margin. So how does this translate into a victory for Clinton? Ask yourself why an excited crowd of thousands came to the election night event of a loser when this kind of crowd has never come to the event of a primary loser in California’s history. Perhaps this is because Sanders didn’t lose. Votes can be flipped in less than a minute by someone walking into the Registrars office. Watch Bev Harris’s documentary Hacking Democracy and the video of a confession on the creator of a program designed to do just that below.

Prior to going into the California primary, it was known that Sanders was going to insist that the Democratic National Convention nominate the winner of the California primary. Clinton is very unpopular in California and it would have been impossible for her to acquire the votes to win legitimately. There was only one way for Clinton to win and that was to rig the election. Those running the Democratic Party have made it clear, following the known rigging of elections in other states, that they either consider election fraud and rigging a proper way to win a nomination or don’t care if a candidate wins this way.

Back to forcing the majority of Sanders voters to vote uncounted provisional ballots. You may ask, how Hillary knew who to disenfranchise? There are multiple ways. First, new voters were overwhelmingly planning to vote for Bernie. Second, of the NPP (no party preference) voters, the vast majority were Sanders supporters. But it may also be the Sanders campaign that owes the voters an apology for letting Clinton know which voters to disenfranchise.

Last December the relationship between NGP Van and Clinton and that Van’s apparent willingness to engage in unethical conduct on behalf of the Clinton campaign was widely exposed. Yet, the primary applications the Sanders campaign uses for canvassing were obtained from NGP Van. One of the main application programs the Sanders campaign used for canvassing is called Minivan. It is well known that many many, if not most, manufacturers leave a backdoor allowing them to re-access programs.

In Arizona, Sanders poll workers were told on the last day before the election that it was known that their MiniVan program had been hacked and that on that pre-election day, people would be using paper canvassing sheets. This was just for the last minute stuff. Almost all the canvassing had been done already in Arizona. What did the Sanders volunteers tell MiniVan (and possibly the Clinton campaign) about the voters they canvassed or called? They marked if the person was: “Strong Sanders,” “Leaning Sanders,” “Strong Clinton,””Leaning Clinton,” or “Undecided,” among other things. If you were Clinton and you wanted to disenfranchise millions of voters, wouldn’t it be nice to know who is supporting your opponent? For the record, reporters for the Justice Gazette did bring their concerns about MiniVan to the attention of the Sanders campaign following Arizona. However, the campaign went back to using this in state after state.

While the public is mostly loyal to Sanders, some question the loyalty of some of his staffers. Canvassers were given wildly inaccurate precinct phone and walking lists that left off most of the voters who were planning to support Sanders. Canvassers were supposed to skip about 20 or more houses for every one they hit. Usually the one selected had the wrong occupant while the new occupants of the selected houses as well as people who were supposed to be passed over in the other 20, often said they were registered and planning to vote for Bernie to canvassers who chose to speak to them anyway. It was pointed out to the campaign that it would have been easier and more productive to go door to door to all the houses than to search around for the one inaccurate address on a street a mile from the last address.

Another key alert as to possible infiltrators was the odd treatment of the press. While Correct the Record and reporters/hackers from other organizations and media groups promoting Clinton were treated like royalty, members of the press who had gone on record supporting Sanders were often treated with contempt by certain members of the team running logistics at the rallies. Correct the Record (the PAC paying a million dollars to hackers who put child pornography on Sanders facebook pages and then got them closed down) was given the best filming location in San Pedro after that same prime filming location had been denied to news teams favorable to Sanders. On election night, several reporters favorable to Sanders commented on how rudely they were being treated. Reginald Hubbard and Jesse Cornett who reportedly threatened some of the mild-mannered, more loyal press with loss of equipment, removal or confiscation of their press credentials (which they had brought with them) and removal of the actual reporters from the event in response to polite questions about the sound arrangements. Most of the pro-Sanders reporters were placed on a riser near distorted speakers and denied access to the event’s sound boxes they had been promised and which were provided for other media. One reporter, a very sweet woman, who had been traveling on a bus following the candidate, seemed to disappear from the event after she reported that she had been rudely treated by these same staff people prior to the speech.

The fix was in before the primary. An instructional video for poll workers told them to give provisional ballots to NPP voters, official conduct that would have been illegal in California. AP joined in the effort to try to fix the election by calling the nomination for Clinton the night before the election when AP knew or should have known that Clinton did not have enough pledged delegates and would not have enough on June 7th to be the nominee. This appears to have been part of the overall attempt to suppress the vote. As Sanders has repeatedly pointed out,

“If there is a large turnout we will win. If there is a very large turnout we will win huge. If there is a low turnout, we will lose.”

In spite of AP’s false call, the actual turnout was very large and, but for the suppression, the evidence supports the theory that Sanders would have won by a very wide margin.

Overall, it was a tough night for Sanders supporters. The average American is not about to support Hillary Clinton. Nobody at the election night event believed there was any accuracy in the results. Despite the officials results (which left off half or more of the voters), the Sanders supporters were optimistic as they knew in their hearts that Sanders had won California. With the election rigging and theft so obvious, the bulk of the public does not believe that Clinton is a legitimate nominee. The bulk of the Democratic voters will never accept Clinton or vote for her in the general election. Some are calling the theft of the nomination a “coup d’ etat,” “treason” and “sedition” on Clinton’s part.

As for the voters who weren’t allowed to vote, the buck stop with two people: California Secretary of State and Clinton supporter Alex Padilla and Hillary Clinton, herself, the candidate who benefited from the voter suppression. Almost everyone in American knows or is related to one of Clinton’s victims. Clinton’s apparent crimes are against the American people and this matters more than whether a clown is running as a nominee the other party. America has survived racist clown Presidents in the past but is not about to endure a President who has committed crimes that have destroyed the right to vote of people they know.

The crowd at the Sanders rally is not going to give up. In fact they are energized and angry and most of them have as their top goal, defeating Hillary Clinton in all elections. If Bernie were to endorse her, his supporters would be saddened and many would feel betrayed, but the Sanders voters have made it clear that they will not follow Bernie to Clinton.

In view of the information from polling place workers about Sanders winning by more than a 2 to 1 margin and in view of the removal of 2/3 or more of his votes from the official results, the Justice Gazette declares Bernie Sanders the landslide winner of the 2016 California Primary Election.

A historic lawsuit has been filed in California after a widespread cover-up of Bernie Sanders’ landslide victory at the primary election earlier in the week.

The lawsuit will require the counting of all the provisional ballots, which Sanders says gives him a landslide win in the state.

There is more bad news for cigarette smokers – the US government is raising the age of consumption to 25 years old, due to the increasing health dangers of tobacco.

The cost of healthcare to treat the illnesses caused by tobacco was $96 billion in 2014.

By raising the legal age of consumption to 25 years old, it is estimated to reduce these costs by nearly 60% by the year 2021.

According to the Cancer.org website, tobacco use remains the single largest preventable cause of disease and premature death in the US.

Yet more than 45 million Americans still smoke cigarettes.

Tobacco smoke contains 7000 chemicals and compounds. Hundreds of these are toxic, and at least 69 are cancer-causing.

Currently there is a proposal to add an additional $2.50 tax to the price of a pack of cigarettes. They say a vote for raising the cigarette tax, as well as raising the age of consumption, is a vote against cancer.

States must increase their tobacco tax, because they expect the sales of cigarettes to dramatically decrease when raising the legal age of consumption to 25.

But Roy Jensen, director of the University of Kansas Cancer Center insists, “The most important components are the health benefits that will derive from it.”

However, The Citizens for Tobacco Rights are not happy about this new law which is set to take effect September 2016.

“If Congress gives the president what he wants, federal excise taxes will have increased almost ten-fold in just over a decade,” says the tobacco rights website. “The president’s tax increase will take the average price per pack up to $7.85, and put more than 70% of the price you pay for cigarettes into government pockets.”

When raising the legal age of tobacco consumption to 25, you can expect more black-market sales of cigarettes as well as arrests for underage purchases.

Activists say this law will only add to the problem.

Tanya Gaskin, a 35-year-old mother of Greenville, North Carolina, has been arrested in connection with the death of her four-month-old daughter. The whereabouts of the missing infant has left authorities in shock.

According to the incident report, Gaskins had notified police that her 4-month-old daughter went missing three days ago. Gaskins was unable to find her daughter after breast-feeding the infant. She told police that her newborn daughter was in the bed with her and they both had taken a nap. After she had awakened, her daughter was missing.

“I took a nap around 4 PM after I ate some leftover KFC my neighbor had brought me and some chocolate cake,” Gaskins told police. “At the same time I was eating, I breast-fed my daughter for about 20 minutes then we both fell asleep. When I woke up around 6:30 PM and my little angel was gone. No one was at my house during that time that I know of.”

Authorities immediately searched the home of Gaskins but found no trace of the newborn baby girl. Police thoroughly questioned the mom and determined that she had no relation to the sudden disappearance of her daughter.

Three days following the incident, police arrived at the residence of Tanya Gaskins to be met by paramedics who were in the process of transporting the 700 pound women to the hospital. According to the paramedics, Tanya Gaskin had called 911 because of severe pains in her abdomen. Paramedics told the police that the house smelled of “something dead” with the odor lingering on Gaskins.

Police followed the paramedics to the hospital where doctors examined the morbidly obese woman – presenting the most gruesome discovery both doctors and the police had ever witnessed in the city of Greenville. The pain that Gaskins complained about in her abdomen, which doctors thought was appendicitis, was from the rotting corpse of her 4-month-old daughter. The girls tiny body was trapped under the fat of her mother.

Medical examiners determine the Gaskins rolled over the little girl while they both were sleeping, which led to the baby’s body getting stuck in the crevices of her mom. “The weight instantly killed the little girl, crushing her ribs and suffocating the child,” said Dr. Kingston, emergency room physician. “Because of the amount of fat on Tanya Gaskins body, she was unable to feel the little body being crushed underneath her. There was no way the little girl would have survived long in that situation.”

Tonya Gaskins was charged with child endangerment and involuntary manslaughter and is under house arrest awaiting trial.

The parents of a 3 year old girl woke up to tragedy Monday morning as their child was found dead in her bed. The cause of death, reported by the Los Angeles Coroners Department, was due to a faulty light up fidget spinner that electrocuted the child, giving her 3rd degree burns on the face as she slept with it as it was charging in her bed.

Experts are warning parents of the dangers of purchasing fidget spinners from China, as this is not the first incident of injury. Over 100 children have been injured or killed since their release earlier this year.

“You should never leaving any devise in your bed while it’s charging,” said lead detective Louis Miguel. “We have seen this a number of times, mostly with cell phones. But these fidget spinners are injuring children in large numbers.”

The child was pronounced dead at the scene. The fidget spinner was made in China and purchased online.

Caitlyn Jenner or “CJ” as he refers to herself now during her “African-American” transition, discusses her desire to take her look to the next level. CJ told Good Morning America on Monday that she has a deep desire to search out her African-American roots. After hearing stories from a great uncle on his mother’s side who told her that their family has African-American ancestry, CJ began her search.

She contacted a DNA ethnic testing company and the results were shocking! “When I received the results, I was amazed. My uncle was right!” CJ told good morning America. “The results show that I am part of the Kalenjin tribe from the Western Highlands of Kenya. They are also known for their great athletics. I guess that’s where I got my athleticism from.”

CJ went on to say that she is studying the Kalenjin tribe and has a trip scheduled for after the first of next year to visit the area. “I want to learn more, I want to immerse myself in the experience,” she said. “By the time I get back, you will see the difference. I’m perming my hair and keeping this tan, although I feel it’s a bit too bronze for me. I’m really looking for a great cocoa shade.”

CJ went on to say that she is also considering some additional plastic surgery that includes bigger breast size, larger lips and a Brazilian butt lift.

An unidentified man entered a Tennessee Walmart, armed with nothing more than his own teeth. Eyewitnesses say the man, who look like he had been living off the streets, entered the store looking as if he was in a “daze.”

When confronted by a Walmart employee, the homeless man lunged at the victim sinking his teeth into the employees arm. As one of the customers attempted to save the employee, the crazed man bit the shopper in the neck.

“There were three other men that i saw who ran in to try to save the victims, but then they became victims,” said Rachel Stephenson who is shopping in the store at the time of the incident. “Every time someone stepped in to help, he bit into them with his teeth. I only got a quick glance, but I swear it look like he had fangs. It was absolutely terrifying.”

Walmart shoppers were eventually able to subdue the violent man and restrain him until police arrived. In total, six people were bitten and one was taken to the hospital in critical condition due to a severed artery in the neck. The attacker, who still has yet to be identified, is assumed to be homeless and is currently being held at a Tennessee psychiatric hospital. There is no word yet on whether or not drugs played a factor in this incident.

This incident comes just two days after a 24-year-old Brazilian man collapsed and died aboard an Irish aircraft after biting another passenger. The man was said to possibly be on methamphetamines when he became frantic and began biting into the flesh of another passenger on board. Unfortunately, authorities say they have seen an increase in these types of attacks, calling them Zombie-Like assaults.

Cleveland, Ohio | A naked man caused quite a commotion in a Walmart supercenter this morning when he randomly bit dozens of customers while barking and screaming.

29-year old Michael Kruger entered the store naked and visibly intoxicated around 9:30 AM this morning.

He immediately began running around the supercenter, jumping on some of the customers and savagely biting them.

Ruth Davis, an employee who witnessed the attack, says the aggressor looked like he was possessed or infected with rabies.

“He was running around naked like a maniac. He was drooling a lot and biting people. He looked like a rabid animal.”

The Walmart employee says that Mr. Kruger kept making strange sounds and saying incoherent things.

“He kept barking like a dog and yelling stuff about the Vatican being out to get him.”

Mr. Kruger bit a total of 28 people and lightly assaulted a dozen others before he was finally arrested by the Cleveland Police.

None of the victims were severely injured, but there is a slight risk that they may have contracted some disease from their aggressor.

Michael Kruger told investigators that he spent the entire night smoking crystal meth and had decided to walk to the Walmart to get some food.

He explained that he had taken off his clothes on the way to “get rid of the spying equipment the Vatican had planted” on him and was biting people to “make sure they’re not terminators” sent to kill him.

Mr. Kruger’s lawyer demanded that he undergo a psychiatric evaluation before the beginning of his trial.

He faces a total of 47 criminal charges and a maximum of 240 years in prison.

Newark, New Jersey | A man was arrested on his work site this morning after it was discovered that he was ejaculating in his employer’s coffee every morning.

38-year old Lewis Williams spent the last four years working as the personal assistant of Ms. Linda Moore, executive president of the DANCO engineering firm.

Among his tasks as Ms. Moore’s assistant, he was to take her phone calls, set her schedule and bring her a cup of coffee to her desk every day when she arrived at work.

After a dispute with his boss this morning, Mr. Williams admitted in front of a dozen coworkers, that he had ejaculated in her coffee “hundreds of time”.

According to Brian Little, an intern who witnessed the entire scene, Lewis Williams showed no remorse while he confessed his crime.

“He almost looked proud when he told her: ‘I’ve been eating your shit for four years, but all this time, you’ve been drinking my cum!’ He then smiled and explained everything.”

The angry employee explained that he had been putting “extra cream” in Ms. Moore’s coffee, five days a week and over many years.

After his confession, his colleagues called the police and Mr. Williams was arrested on the site.

A total of 910 criminal charges has been filed against him, including 860 charges of sexual assault. If found guilty on all charges, he could face up to 1070 years in prison.

A three month old baby has been reunited with her parents after being kidnapped by a man at Riverfront Park in Little Rock, Arkansas. There are not many details on how the man acquired the baby at the park. However, it’s what he did with the baby after he kidnapped her that has the community shocked.

According to employees at McDonald’s, a heavyset man, 45 year old Henry Osterman, entered the restaurant on Monday around 2:30 PM with a baby wrapped in a blanket. He seemed a bit nervous, and told the employee at the cash register that he had the munchies as he ordered 15 Big Macs. According to reports, when the cashier gave him his total, he handed over the baby to her. “I look to him and said ‘Whatcu think I’m gonna do with that,'” said Chandra Wilkins head cashier at the Little Rock McDonald’s. “He told me he didn’t have any money but I could take the baby. I said ‘Fool you need to back the f*ck up’. Then that’s when he threw the baby at me, ran behind the cash registers and grabbed every burger on the food warmer. That white man was crazy.”

Two other employees stepped into action and tackled the would be ‘Hamburglar.’ Unfortunately, the size of the man was too much for the employees to take down the kidnapper. That’s when eyewitnesses say a third employee, Todd Williams, clotheslined the man with a broom handle and took him down to the ground. “That was a big dude,” said Williams. “I grabbed the broom, swung at real real hard, and crack that punk in the neck. He fell and hit his head on the floor, knocked him clean out. My aim’s on fleek”

Police searched Osterman’s 1972 cargo van that was parked in the McDonald’s parking lot where they discovered another infant strapped into a car seat, approximately 6 months old. They also recovered several firearms, knives and a neatly displayed collection of baby toys, bottles and other baby related items. They also recovered several roles of duct tape, rope and 20 bottles of Benadryl. Osterman was taken into custody and charged with kidnapping, assault, theft and child endangerment. He is currently being held on an $800 bond.

We go through life, or better yet, are conditioned in life to accept the Standard American Diet as the key to staying healthy, but get turned into “tricks’ by the mainstream media/medical/government agency’ hookers” that support their Lord and Masters – the large food companies, the processed food companies and of course the All-Mighty pharmaceutical industry, affectionately recognized as the “pimps”.

But, what about natural therapies that have been used since time immemorial to treat disease?

The Old and New Testaments talk about the use of herbs. Way before the Roman or Christian times, uses of water – hydrotherapy – to effect healing was prominent and going back several centuries, the American Indians were complete naturopaths.

Somehow, the science of natural healing, or naturopathy, emerged.

When we look at what Hippocrates espoused – the treating of disease with diet, fasting, herbs, hydrotherapy, exercise and spinal manipulation – it makes one wonder if modern medicine somehow got on the wrong bus.

The most basic tenet of healing, “only nature heals, emphasizes the body’s ability to heal itself. And if given the chance, it will do just that.

Unfortunately, the bus that modern medicine boarded was driven by the pharmaceutical industry that did nothing more than advocate the widespread use of drugs and surgery.

So, as the forerunners of naturopathy emerged, they all tried to convince a skeptical public that nature, not drugs and surgery, was the true path to good health.

Because of the financial strength and political power of Big Pharma, orthodox medicine grew in leaps and bounds and most of the alternative medical schools were forced to close. Not only were naturopaths declared illegal, but midwives, chiropractors, herbalists, acupuncturists and the like took really big hits.

Back as early as 1990 a chiropractor used to be a primary care physician for automobile and work comp injuries and could refer patients for massage. But the paranoid, money-hungry, powers to be used their financial power to make it that only an MD could be the primary and only the MD could refer for chiropractic and massage.

With the 60s a new generation of awareness manifested and all aspects of modern society were looked at very carefully. Many drug-related tragedies made the people question not only how effective, but how safe a drug was especially with so many drug related horror stories being made public.

As always, the medical community raves on and on about schooling and training. Yet they ignore the fact that naturopathic training involves both traditional and modern techniques of diagnosis and therapy, that they are trained in 4-year state accredited naturopathic medical schools, and that their curriculum encompasses all the basic science, diagnostic and medical courses that an MD gets. In addition, the naturopath training involves natural therapies to help the body repair itself.

So the aim is to treat the person and not the disease, to remove the cause and not just the symptom, and to cure the disease, not just put it off for a while.

There’s a law in life that says that the cells in the body are endowed with an inherent trait of self-preservation.

This “law” however, needs to be viewed from varying perspectives: if the body can heal itself, why bother to treat disease at all? If the body can heal itself doesn’t this “law” guarantee cure? Why can’t I simply watch TV while my body reverses my arthritis, cancer, heart disease or type-2 diabetes? Because common sense tells us differently, that’s why.

Disease equates to an unbalance of harmony in the body brought about by various influences that cause the disruption in the body’s equilibrium. Despite this, the body is can protect itself from these external disruptions through discipline, austerity and perseverance.

But, nearly every aspect of our lives causes some sort of disharmony in our physical, mental, moral and spiritual plane. Despite this our bodies are designed to protect itself from any serious threat.

Where we once exerted tremendous efforts for demanding physical exercise, our bodies now perform many effortless tasks. Where our diet used to center around whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, pure water and simple proteins, we now consume refined, devitalized grains, pesticide laden fruits and vegetables, fluoridated water, caffeine rich teas, coffee and sodas and heavily poisoned proteins. To add insult to injury, we take drugs, both “recreational” and prescribed, smoke all forms of health depleting tobacco, and are exposed to toxic chemicals and radiation in the air, the rivers, streams and oceans.

Where things used to be relatively mellow we are now subjected to increased mental and emotional stress through failed relationships, workplace trauma and pressures placed upon us through peer pressure.

Normally we can adapt and use our innate mechanisms to clear this garbage. But what happens when our safety channels get clogged or over burdened or suppressed? What happens when our bodies can no longer maintain its harmony? Disease happens.

Are there certain paths that the disease process takes place? Hell yeah!

We accumulate toxins due to crappy diets, poor circulation and elimination, and using our TV remotes more that our arms, legs and lungs. This first manifests within the cells and then encompasses the whole body/

Our meat-based, junk-food diets reduce our vitality, lead to nutritional deficiencies, clogged arteries and eventually degeneration of our tissues. Furthermore, we constantly ingest artificial chemicals and colors, enormous pesticides and synthetic fertilizers, which change the natural balance of the soil, causing our bodies to work even harder to detoxify these horrors. And this equates to virtually all forms of disease.

Then we don’t stand tall, we slouch, sprawl in chairs and couches, have poor muscle tone due to our lack of exercise and as our normal curves change, we develop spinal problems and weak abdominal muscles. And what this equates to is poor blood and lymph supply to internal organs, which lends itself to poor drainage and tissue vitality, resulting in congestion and accumulations of toxins in the body.

Then there are the head-trips: fear, anxiety, hate, envy, low self-esteem, resentment, etc., which upsets digestion, blood flow, hormonal imbalance and major stress.

Then the MDs supply us with toxic drugs and vaccines giving us allergies, asthma, ADHD, autism and many long-term health problems, especially as we hit old age.

People take for granted that alcohol, coffee and tobacco use is not really a big deal.

But they are, as repeated use manifests in damage to the liver, lungs, pancreas, thyroid, and adrenals.

Bear in mind that if harmful bacteria, like GMOs, are allowed to multiply, typical symptoms of disease result.

So, what can we do to keep the body in a healthy condition to fight bacteria? One way is to keep the flora in the intestinal tract strong and healthy. Keeping the body’s pH alkaline rather than acidic is another way.

Basically, the body starts out well protected. When we do all those things to weaken it, disease has a stronghold. But then the body is also equipped with venues to free it from these encumbrances.

Fever not only removes toxins from the body but also increases the body’s metabolic rate as well as blood and lymph circulation. Fever also creates a not so friendly environment for bacteria or viruses, which normally have a low-heat tolerance. So when fever increases these organisms die faster.

When you have a fever, you normally sweat. The sweat carries toxins out of the system and it raises the body’s temperature to a range that will not cause a problem.

To localize a problem in the body, inflammation, swelling and edema are actions by which the body can do this. These symptoms indicate what area needs attention.

Despite not seeing them as friendly, diarrhea and vomiting are the body’s way of getting rid of toxins.

Sneezing and coughing are the body’s strong attempts to get rid of toxins and irritants as well. Coughing gets rid of mucous and reduces the spread of infection, especially after a cold or the flu and sneezing concentrates on the irritants in the upper respiratory system.

And finally, pain. Pain says, “I have a problem here” and should not be ignored. Pain is also telling you to back off and rest.

So, all of these acute symptoms of disease are basically the result of the body to reestablish equilibrium and positive health. They will correct and eliminate and should not be suppressed or ignored and if not allowed to run their course or be allowed to do what they are supposed to do chronic disease will manifest.

What to do, what to do?

First of all, the organic sulfur crystals heal just about everything. Then we need to build and strengthen the immune system. Did you know that fresh bee pollen contains all 20 amino acids, all the B vitamins, including B12, probiotics, enzymes, antioxidants and more? Off course you didn’t.

This article is the tip of the iceberg with more to follow. After reading this and what’s coming, it’s up to you to choose the road you travel on.

“The Mucusless Diet Healing System” by Prof. Arnold Ehret

~_~

Maybe you once struggled with joint and muscle pain, or perhaps chronic bloating or diarrhea. Perhaps you used to feel fatigued all the time. Everybody you knew was talking about going “gluten free,” and said how much better they felt when they did. But you hesitated—after all, bread is delicious! Could you really go the rest of your life without eating “real” pasta or pizza crusts or fresh-baked bread? You Googled it and found that all kinds of “reputable” sources said gluten sensitivity wasn’t real.

But still… could everyone you knew be wrong?

At last you just tried it, and you were amazed at how much better you felt without gluten as a staple in your diet. But that still didn’t totally make sense to you. Our ancestors have been eating wheat for thousands of years, after all!

Then maybe you went on vacation in Europe, and thought, what the heck… I’m going to eat what I want. It’s vacation! To your surprise, the Italian pasta and the French pastries caused you no problems whatsoever. You wondered if maybe you’d imagined gluten sensitivity after all… until you came back to the States and tried to maintain your new diet. Quickly, all the old symptoms returned.

So are you allergic to gluten, or aren’t you?

I’d heard this story many times from my patients before it happened to me personally. Bread is one of my favorite things, but I learned the hard way that eating gluten makes my gut very unhappy. It’s just not worth it. Yet while vacationing in Southern Ireland, the hearty brown bread served at nearly every meal looked too good to pass up. I ate it at every opportunity (it was vacation, after all)… and I felt just fine. But when I tried to eat the brown bread in Northern Ireland (part of the UK), I felt sick again. We crossed over to Southern Ireland again (part of Europe): no problems. Then in the States: sick again.

After investigating this upon my return, I found that there are three main possible causes of the disparity between gluten in the US (and the UK potentially), and gluten in Europe.

Differences in Gluten Abroad vs At Home

Can You Have Your Bread (and Eat It Too?)

If you are gluten sensitive (not Celiac) in the US, but you don’t want to move to Europe OR give up your bread, here are a few approaches to try.

Choose 100% Sourdough. As mentioned As mentioned here , sourdough pre-digests the gluten protein for you, so that most people who are gluten sensitive can eat sourdough bread without a problem. If you buy sourdough from the grocery, though, it’s likely been mixed with regular flour. The safest way to do it is to buy a sourdough starter and make your own. Choose sprouted grains. The sprouting process also breaks down the gluten proteins. It does not render the bread completely gluten free, but it does lower the gluten content enough that some people who are gluten intolerant can eat it without a problem. It is possible to sprout your own grains, or you can choose some of the sprouted brands already on the market. Choose organic wheat. The organic label means non-GMO, and no synthetic pesticides. This is a good way to avoid the Round-Up content in your wheat. While you’re at it, consider baking recipes that include buttermilk as well.

Abstract Celiac disease, and, more generally, gluten intolerance, is a growing problem worldwide, but especially in North America and Europe, where an estimated 5% of the population now suffers from it. Symptoms include nausea, diarrhea, skin rashes, macrocytic anemia and depression. It is a multifactorial disease associated with numerous nutritional deficiencies as well as reproductive issues and increased risk to thyroid disease, kidney failure and cancer. Here, we propose that glyphosate, the active ingredient in the herbicide, Roundup®, is the most important causal factor in this epidemic. Fish exposed to glyphosate develop digestive problems that are reminiscent of celiac disease. Celiac disease is associated with imbalances in gut bacteria that can be fully explained by the known effects of glyphosate on gut bacteria. Characteristics of celiac disease point to impairment in many cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are involved with detoxifying environmental toxins, activating vitamin D3, catabolizing vitamin A, and maintaining bile acid production and sulfate supplies to the gut. Glyphosate is known to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes. Deficiencies in iron, cobalt, molybdenum, copper and other rare metals associated with celiac disease can be attributed to glyphosate's strong ability to chelate these elements. Deficiencies in tryptophan, tyrosine, methionine and selenomethionine associated with celiac disease match glyphosate's known depletion of these amino acids. Celiac disease patients have an increased risk to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which has also been implicated in glyphosate exposure. Reproductive issues associated with celiac disease, such as infertility, miscarriages, and birth defects, can also be explained by glyphosate. Glyphosate residues in wheat and other crops are likely increasing recently due to the growing practice of crop desiccation just prior to the harvest. We argue that the practice of “ripening” sugar cane with glyphosate may explain the recent surge in kidney failure among agricultural workers in Central America. We conclude with a plea to governments to reconsider policies regarding the safety of glyphosate residues in foods. Keywords: celiac disease, gluten, glyphosate, food, cytochrome P450, deficiency

1 Introduction Gluten intolerance is a growing epidemic in the U.S. and, increasingly, worldwide. Celiac sprue is a more specific disorder, characterized by gluten intolerance along with autoantibodies to the protein, transglutaminase, which builds crosslinks in undigested fragments of gliadin, a major constituent of gluten (Green & Cellier, 2007). The autoantibodies are produced as an immune response to undegraded fragments of proteins in gluten. A remarkable set of symptoms develop over time in association with celiac disease, including weight loss, diarrhea, chronic fatigue, neurological disorders, anemia, nausea, skin rashes, depression, and nutrient deficiencies. Usually, but not always, a strict gluten-free diet can alleviate many of the symptoms. A key associated pathology is an inflammatory response in the upper small intestine, leading to villous atrophy, a flattening of the microvilli which impairs their ability to function in their important role in absorbing nutrients. Some have suggested that the recent surge in celiac disease is simply due to better diagnostic tools. However, a recent study tested frozen sera obtained between 1948 and 1954 for antibodies to gluten, and compared the results with sera obtained from a matched sample from people living today (Rubio-Topia et al., 2009). They identified a four-fold increase in the incidence of celiac disease in the newer cohort compared to the older one. They also determined that undiagnosed celiac disease is associated with a 4-fold increased risk of death, mostly due to increased cancer risk. They concluded that the prevalence of undiagnosed celiac disease has increased dramatically in the United States during the past 50 years. Transglutaminases play many important roles in the body, as they form covalent crosslinks in complex proteins in connection with blood coagulation, skin-barrier formation, extracellular matrix assembly, and fertilization, endowing the substrate with protection from degradation by proteases (Lorand & Graham, 2003). They also form crosslinks in undigested fragments of gliadin derived from wheat, and sensitivity to certain of these fragments leads to the development of autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase (Esposito et al., 2002) that inhibit its activity. Glyphosate is the active ingredient in the herbicide Roundup. It is a broad-spectrum herbicide, considered to be nearly nontoxic to humans (Williams et al., 2000). However, a recent paper (Samsel & Seneff, 2013), argued that glyphosate may be a key contributor to the obesity epidemic and the autism epidemic in the United States, as well as to several other diseases and conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, infertility, depression, and cancer. Glyphosate suppresses 5-enolpyruvylshikimic acid-3-phosphate synthase (EPSP synthase), the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of the aromatic amino acids, tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine, in the shikimate pathway of bacteria, archaea and plants (de María et al., 1996). In plants, aromatic amino acids collectively represent up to 35% of the plant dry mass (Franz, 1997). This mode of action is unique to glyphosate among all emergent herbicides. Humans do not possess this pathway, and therefore we depend upon our ingested food and our gut microbes to provide these essential nutrients. Glyphosate, patented as an antimicrobial (Monsanto Technology LLC, 2010), has been shown to disrupt gut bacteria in animals, preferentially killing beneficial forms and causing an overgrowth of pathogens. Two other properties of glyphosate also negatively impact human health – chelation of minerals such as iron and cobalt, and interference with cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, which play many important roles in the body. We will have much more to say about these aspects in later sections of this paper. A recent study on glyphosate exposure in carnivorous fish revealed remarkable adverse effects throughout the digestive system (Senapati et al., 2009). The activity of protease, lipase, and amylase were all decreased in the esophagus, stomach, and intestine of these fish following exposure to glyphosate. The authors also observed “disruption of mucosal folds and disarray of microvilli structure” in the intestinal wall, along with an exaggerated secretion of mucin throughout the alimentary tract. These features are highly reminiscent of celiac disease. Gluten peptides in wheat are hydrophobic and therefore resistant to degradation by gastric, pancreatic and intestinal proteases (Hershko & Patz, 2008). Thus, the evidence from this effect on fish suggests that glyphosate may interfere with the breakdown of complex proteins in the human stomach, leaving larger fragments of wheat in the human gut that will then trigger an autoimmune response, leading to the defects in the lining of the small intestine that are characteristic of these fish exposed to glyphosate and of celiac patients. As illustrated in , the usage of glyphosate on wheat in the U.S. has risen sharply in the last decade, in step with the sharp rise in the incidence of Celiac disease. We explain the reasons for increased application of glyphosate to wheat in Section 13. Hospital discharge diagnosis (any) of celiac disease ICD-9 579 and glyphosate applications to wheat (R=0.9759, p≤1.862e-06). Sources: USDA:NASS; CDC. (Figure courtesy of Nancy Swanson). In the remainder of this paper, we will first show that gut dysbiosis, brought on by exposure to glyphosate, plays a crucial role in the development of celiac disease. Many CYP enzymes are impaired in association with celiac disease, and we show that glyphosate's known suppression of CYP enzyme activity in plants and animals plausibly explains this effect in humans. In Section 4, we describe the role of excess retinoic acid in celiac disease, and show how this ties also to reproductive problems. We link this to the known effects of glyphosate on retinoic acid, mediated by its suppression of CYP enzymes. Section 5 addresses cobalamin deficiency, a known pathology associated with celiac disease that leads to macrocytic anemia. We argue that this follows as a direct consequence of glyphosate's ability to chelate cobalt. Section 6 discusses in more depth the role of anemia in celiac disease, a consequence of both cobalamin and iron deficiency. Section 7 discusses molybdenum deficiency and its link to microcephaly, which is associated with celiac disease. Section 8 discusses the link between selenium deficiency and autoimmune thyroid disease. Section 9 discusses kidney disease in connection with celiac disease and glyphosate. Section 10 discusses various nutritional deficiencies associated with celiac disease, and shows how these can directly be explained by glyphosate. Section 11 discusses the link between celiac disease and certain rare cancers that have also been linked to glyphosate. Section 12 goes into an in-depth discussion of how glyphosate might promote autoantibodies to transglutaminase. Following a section which presents compelling evidence that glyphosate residues in wheat, sugar and other crops are likely increasing in recent decades, and a section discussing the increased risk to kidney failure in agricultural workers exposed to excess glyphosate occupationally, we close with a discussion section that summarizes our findings, and a conclusion which implores governments to pay more attention to the damaging consequences of the escalation in chemical warfare on weeds that characterizes current agricultural practices.

2 Gut bacteria In this section, we first discuss the role of pathogens in inducing the breakdown of tight junctions in enterocytes lining the small intestinal wall. We then show that glyphosate is associated with an overgrowth of pathogens along with an inflammatory bowel disease in animal models. A parallel exists with celiac disease where the bacteria that are positively and negatively affected by glyphosate are overgrown or underrepresented respectively in association with celiac disease in humans. We also discuss how the beneficial bacteria that are negatively impacted by glyphosate can protect from celiac disease through their enzymatic activities on gluten, and point to several articles recommending treatment plans based on probiotics. Pathogens, through their activation of a potent signaling molecule called zonulin, induce a breakdown of the tight junctions in cells lining the gut, leading to “leaky gut” syndrome (Fasano, 2011). Concentrations of zonulin were sharply elevated (p<0.000001) in subjects with celiac disease during the acute phase (Fasano et al., 2000). As many as 30% of celiac patients continue to experience GI symptoms after adopting a gluten-free diet, despite optimal adherence, a condition that was attributed to bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine (Tursi et al., 2003). shows that there is a correlation between glyphosate application to wheat and the incidence of intestinal infections. Deaths due to intestinal infections ICD A04, A09; 008, 009 with glyphosate applications to wheat (R=0.9834, p≤3.975e-09). Sources: USDA:NASS; CDC. (Figure courtesy of Nancy Swanson). Evidence of disruption of gut bacteria by glyphosate is available for poultry (Shehata et al., 2013), cattle (Krüger et al., 2013), and swine (Carman et al., 2013). Glyphosate disrupts the balance of gut bacteria in poultry (Shehata et al., 2013), increasing the ratio of pathogenic bacteria to other commensal microbes. Salmonella and Clostridium are highly resistant to glyphosate, whereas Enterococcus, Bifidobacteria, and Lactobacillus are especially susceptible. Glyphosate was proposed as a possible factor in the increased risk to Clostridium botulinum infection in cattle in Germany over the past ten to fifteen years (Krüger et al., 2013b). Pigs fed GMO corn and soy developed widespread intestinal inflammation that may have been due in part to glyphosate exposure (Carman et al., 2013). Celiac disease is associated with reduced levels of Enterococcus, Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus in the gut and an overgrowth of pathogenic gram negative bacteria (Sanz et al., 2011; Di Cagno et al., 2011; Collado et al., 2007). In (Di Cagno et al., 2011), Lactobacillus, Enterococcus and Bifidobacteria were found to be significantly lower in fecal samples of children with celiac disease compared to controls, while levels of the pathogens, Bacteroides, Staphylococcus, Salmonella, a Shighella were elevated. In (Collado et al., 2007), another study comparing the fecal material of celiac infants to healthy controls, Bacteroides, Clostridium and Staphylococcus were all found to be significantly higher (p<0.05). Sulfate-reducing bacterial counts were also elevated (p<0.05) (Nadal et al., 2007; Collado et al., 2007), an interesting observation which we will return to later in this paper. A significant reduction in Bifidobacteria was also found in (Nadal et al., 2007). An increased excretion of the bacterial metabolites p-Cresol and phenol has also been recognized in association with celiac disease (Tamm, 1984). p-Cresol is produced via anaerobic metabolism of tyrosine by pathogenic bacteria such as Clostridium difficile (D'Ari and Barker, 1985). It is a highly toxic carcinogen, which also causes adverse effects on the central nervous system, the cardiovascular system, lungs, kidney and liver (Kelly et al., 1994). Probiotic treatments are recommended to aid in digestive healing in celiac disease. The proteolytic activity of Lactobacilli aids the breakdown of wheat into less allergenic forms. Ongoing research aims to produce gluten-containing sourdough breads fermented by Lactobacilli that can then serve as probiotics to help ameliorate the symptoms of celiac disease and allow celiac patients to consume wheat (Gobbetti et al., 2007). Probiotic Lactobacilli produce the enzyme phytase which breaks down phytates that would otherwise deplete important minerals and other cations through chelation (Famularo et al., 2005). Their activities would therefore improve absorption of these micronutrients, a known problem in celiac patients (Cavallaro et al., 2004). Glyphosate itself also chelates rare minerals, a subject we will address in the section on nutritional deficiencies. Probiotic treatment with Bifidobacteria has been shown to alleviate symptoms associated with celiac disease (Smecuol et al., 2013; Whorwell et al., 2006). Bifidobacteria suppress the pro-inflammatory milieu triggered by the microbiota of celiac patients (Medina et al., 2008). Live cultures of Bifidobacterium lactis would promote healing of the gut if offered as treatment in conjunction with the gluten-free diet, or might even allow the celiac patient to consume modest amounts of gluten without damaging effects (Lindfors et al., 2008). In this in vitro study, it was demonstrated that B. lactis reduced epithelial permeability and improved the integrity of the tight junctions in human colon cells. In summary, celiac disease is associated with a reduced presence in the gut of commensal bacteria such as Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, which are known to be preferentially killed by glyphosate, and with an overabundance of C. difficile, which is known to be promoted by glyphosate exposure. Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli are both capable of modifying gluten in such a way as to make it less allergenic, a feature that is being exploited in recent efforts to develop gluten-containing foods that may be safe for consumption by celiac patients. Probiotics containing live forms of these bacteria are also being actively marketed today.

3 CYP Enzyme impairment and sulfate depletion As mentioned previously, glyphosate has been shown to suppress CYP enzymes in plants (Lamb et al., 1998) and animals (Hietanen et al., 1983). A study on rats demonstrated that glyphosate decreased the levels of CYP enzymes and monooxygenase activities in the liver and the intestinal activity of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (Hietanen et al., 1983). CYP enzymes are essential for detoxification of many compounds in the liver (Lindros, 1997). Intraperitoneal exposure of rats to Roundup in acute doses over a short time interval induced irreversible damage to hepatocytes and elevated urinary markers of kidney disease. This was associated with lipid peroxidation and elevated levels of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) (El-Shenawy, 2009). CYP3A is constitutively expressed in human intestinal villi and plays an important role in drug metabolism (Cupp & Tracy, 1998). Celiac disease is associated with a decrease in the intestinal CYP3A (Lang et al., 1996). This defect is restored by a gluten free diet. Impaired gallbladder bile acid production (Colombato et al., 1977) and biliary cirrhosis, an inflammatory liver disease characterized by obstruction of the bile duct (Dickey et al., 1997), have been shown to co-occur with celiac disease. CYP enzymes are crucial in the production of bile acids (Lorbek et al., 2012). An obligatory CYP enzyme in bile acid synthesis, CYP27A, has been identified as being identical to the mitochondrial vitamin D3 activating enzyme (Wikvall, 2001). In (Kemppainen et al., 1999), 64% of men and 71% of women with celiac disease were found to be vitamin D3 deficient, manifested as low spinal bone mineral density. Celiac disease is associated with impaired gall bladder function and decreased pancreatic secretions (Brown et al., 1987; Benini et al., 2012) along with recurrent pancreatitis (Patel et al., 1999). Abnormalities in bile acid secretion have been found in children suffering from celiac disease (Ejderhamn et al., 1992). Celiac patients exhibit abnormally low synthesis of cholecystokinin (Deprez et al., 2002), but it has also become apparent that the gall bladder is less responsive to stimulation of contraction by cholecystokinin (Brown et al., 1987). A reversible defect of gallbladder emptying and cholecystokinin release has been identified in association with celiac disease (Maton et al., 1985). These pathologies may be related to impaired CYP enzyme activity induced by glyphosate. While it is clear that CYP enzymes play an important role in bile acid synthesis and in cholesterol homeostasis, the details have not yet been worked out (Lorbek et al., 2012). However, some mouse knockout experiments produce embryonically lethal effects, pointing to the importance of these enzymes to biological systems. Disruption of Cyp7A1, involved in bile acid synthesis in mice, induces elevated serum cholesterol and early death. A link has been established between celiac disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver, which is likely due to the liver's inability to export cholesterol sulfate through the bile acids due to impaired CYP enzymes (Lorbek et al., 2012). This requires a private store of fats to house the excess cholesterol that cannot be exported in bile. This would also likely lead to insufficient sulfate supplies to the small intestine, and could result in impaired heparan sulfate synthesis in the glycosaminoglycans and subsequent pathologies. Heparan sulfate populating the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) surrounding enterocytes is essential for the proper functioning of the small intestines. Leakage of both albumin and water in both the vasculature and tissues results when the negative charge is reduced due to insufficient sulfation of the polysaccharide units (Sunergren et al., 1987). Vascular leakage may be a consequence of degradation of sulfated GAGs due to inflammatory agents (Klein et al., 1992). A similar problem may occur in the kidneys leading to albumin loss into urine during nephrosis (Vernier et al., 1983). Intestinal protein loss in inflammatory enteropathy associated with celiac disease may also be due to a deficiency in the sulfated GAGs (Murch et al., 1993; Murch, 1995). A case study of three infants with congenital absence of enterocyte heparan sulfate demonstrated profound enteric protein loss with secretory diarrhoea and absorption failure, even though their intestines were not inflamed (Murch et al., 1996). In (Samsel and Seneff, 2013), a hypothesis was developed that glyphosate disrupts the transport of sulfate from the gut to the liver and pancreas, due to its competition as a similarly kosmotropic solute that also increases blood viscosity. (Kosmotropes are ions that induce “structure ordering” and “salting out” of suspended particles in colloids). Insufficient sulfate supply to the liver is a simple explanation for reduced bile acid production. The problem is compounded by impaired CYP enzymatic action and impaired cycling of bile acids through defective enterocytes in the upper small intestine. The catastrophic effect of loss of bile acids to the feces due to impaired reuptake compels the liver to adopt a conservative approach of significantly reduced bile acid synthesis, which, in turn, leads to gall bladder disease. The protein, Nuclear factor κ-lightchain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) controls DNA transcription of hundreds of genes and is a key regulator of the immune response to infection (Tieri et al., 2012). Light chains are polypeptide subunits of immunoglobulins. NF-κB responds to stimulation from bacterial and viral antigens, inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α, free radicals, oxidized LDL, DNA damage and UV light. The incidence of acute pancreatitis has been increasing in recent years (Bhatia, 2012), and it often follows billiary disease. A local inflammatory reaction at the site of injury coincides with an increase in the synthesis of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) gas. H 2 S regulates the inflammatory response by exciting the extracellular signal regulated (ERK) pathway, leading to production of NF-κB (Bhatia, 2012). We hypothesize that H 2 S, while toxic, is a source of both energy and sulfate for the pancreas, derived from sulfur-containing amino acids such as cysteine and homocysteine. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) sulfate, but not DHEA, inhibits NF-κB synthesis, suggesting that sulfate deficiency is a driver of inflammation (Iwasaki et al., 2004). While H 2 S is well known as a toxic gas through its inhibition of aerobic respiration, a recent paradigm shift in the research surrounding H 2 S has been inspired by the realization that it is an important signaling gas in the vasculature, on par with nitric oxide (Li et al., 2011). H 2 S can serve as an inorganic source of energy to mammalian cells (Módis et al., 2013). 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferae (3MST) is expressed in the vascular endothelium, and it produces H 2 S from mercaptopyruvate, an intermediary in the breakdown of cysteine (Kimura, 2011). Endogenously produced H 2 S derived from 3-mercaptopyruvate stimulates additional mitochondrial H 2 S production, which then is oxidized to thiosulfate via at least three different pathways (Ingenbleek and Kimura, 2013; Hildebrandt and Grieshaber, 2008; Goubern et al., 2007), producing ATP. The inflammatory agent superoxide can act as substrate for the oxidation of H 2 S to sulfite and subsequently sulfate and the activated form, PAPS (Seneff et al., 2012), but will likely induce oxidative damage in the pancreas, particularly, as we will see in section 7, if molybdenum deficiency impairs sulfite-to-sulfate synthesis. Pancreatic beta cells express extraordinarily high levels of heparan sulfate, which is essential for their survival (Ziolkowski et al., 2012), since it protects them from ROS-induced cell death. Because sulfate transport via the hepatic portal vein is likely disrupted by glyphosate, H 2 S, whether derived from sulfur-containing amino acids or supplied via diffusion following its production by sulfur-reducing bacteria in the gut, can become an important source of sulfur for subsequent sulfate production locally in the pancreatic cells. Pancreatic elastase is a serine protease that is needed to assist in protein degradation, but an overabundance can lead to autolysis of tissues (Ito et al., 1998). Cholesterol sulfate inhibits pancreatic elastase (Ito et al., 1998), so a deficiency in cholesterol sulfate supply due to impaired sulfate supply to the liver and impaired CYP function should increase the risk of tissue digestion by pancreatic enzymes, contributing to the loss of villi in the upper small intestine observed in celiac disease. In the early 1990's a newly recognized disease began to appear, characterized by eosinophil infiltration into the esophagus, which manifested as dysphagia in adults and refractory reflux symptoms in children (Lucendo & Sánchez-Cazalilla, 2012). This disease, termed eosinophilic esophagitis (EOE), is associated with a Th2 immune profile and synthesis of the cytokine IL-13, which has direct cytotoxic effects on epithelial cells. A dose-dependent induction of eosinophilia by intratracheal delivery of IL-13 confirms its association with EOE (Mishra and Rothenberg, 2003). An association has been found between EOE and celiac disease (Leslie et al., 2010). Patients with refractory celiac disease that is not corrected by dietary gluten restriction show an increased production of IL-13 in the gut (Gross et al., 2013). The incidence of EOE has increased at alarming rates in Western countries in the last three decades (Furuta et al., 2007; Liacouras et al., 2011; Prasad et al., 2009). Glyphosate is highly corrosive to the esophageal epidermal lining, with upper GI tract injury observed in 94% of patients following glyphosate ingestion (Chang et al., 1999). In (Zouaoui et al., 2013), the most common symptoms in an acute response from glyphosate poisoning were oropharyngeal ulceration, nausea and vomiting. We hypothesize that glyphosate induces EOE via a systemic response as well as through direct contact. The pathogenesis of EOE is related to food sensitivities, but airborne exposure to chemicals in the lungs can also induce it, so it does not require physical contact to the allergen (Blanchard & Rothenberg, 2008). It is conceivable that glyphosate is responsible for the emergence of EOE. The cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) and cytochrome P450 (CP) enzyme system is essential for inducing nitric oxide release from organic nitrates (Li, 2006). The nitrate moiety is reduced while simultaneously oxidizing NADPH to NADP+. This system is invoked in organic nitrate drug treatment for cardiovascular therapy. The reaction depends on anaerobic, acidic conditions, a feature of venous rather than arterial blood. Since L-arginine is substrate for NO synthesis by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) under oxidative conditions (Förstermann and Münze, 2006), it is likely that CPR and CP play an important role mainly in stimulating venous smooth muscle relaxation. Impaired venous relaxation would likely contribute to venous thrombosis, which is a well-established complication of celiac disease (Zenjari et al., 1995; Marteau et al., 1994, Grigg, 1999, Halfdanarson et al., 2007). In summary, celiac disease is associated with multiple pathologies in the digestive system, including impaired gall bladder function, fatty liver, pancreatitis, and EOE. We have argued here that many of these problems can be traced to impaired CYP function in the liver due to glyphosate exposure, leading to insufficient flow of bile acids through the circular pathway between the liver and the gut. This results in a system-wide depletion in sulfate, which induces inflammation in multiple organs to produce sulfate locally. A potential sulfur source for sulfate synthesis could be hydrogen sulfide gas, provided in part by the local breakdown of sulfur-containing amino acids like cysteine and homocysteine and in part by diffusion of the gas produced from inorganic dietary sources by sulfur-reducing bacteria in the large intestine. Impaired CYP enzyme function may also contribute to venous thrombosis, for which celiac disease is an established risk factor.

4 Retinoic acid, celiac disease and reproductive issues In this section, we first establish that excess retinoic acid (RA) is a risk factor for celiac disease. We then show that excess RA leads to complications in pregnancy and teratogenic effects in offspring. Glyphosate has been shown to exhibit teratogenic effects in line with known consequences of excess RA exposure to the embryo, and we propose that the mechanism for this effect may be glyphosate's known disruption of CYP enzymes (Samsel & Seneff, 2013), which are involved in RA catabolism. This then links glyphosate to increased risk to celiac disease via its direct effects on RA. And it identifies a possibly important factor in the association of celiac disease with reproductive issues. We also discuss other adverse effects of excess retinoic acid and a possible relationship to impaired sulfate supply to the gut. In celiac disease, T cells develop antibody responses against dietary gluten, a protein present in wheat (Jabri & Sollid, 2009). RA, a metabolite of vitamin A, has been shown to play a critical role in the induction of intestinal regulatory responses (Mora et al., 2008; Coombes et al., 2007; Mucida et al., 2007). The peptide in gluten, A-gliadin p31-43, induces interleukin 15 (IL-15), a key cytokine promoting T-cell activation (Hershko & Patz, 2008). RA synergizes with high levels of IL-15 to promote JNK phosphorylation (Nanda, 2011; DePaolo et al., 2011), which potentiates cellular apoptosis (Putcha et al., 2003). IL-15 is a causative factor driving the differentiation of precursor cells into anti-gluten CD4+ and CD8+ Th1 cells in the intestinal mucosa. Furthermore, in (DePaolo et al., 2011), it was discovered that RA exhibits an unanticipated co-adjuvant property to induce Th1 immunity to antigens during infection of the intestinal mucosa with pathogens. Retinoic acid has also been shown to directly suppress transglutaminase activity, another way in which it would negatively impact celiac disease (Thacher et al., 1985). Thus, it is becoming clear that excess exposure to RA would increase risk to celiac disease, and warnings have been issued regarding potential adverse effects of RA supplements on celiac disease. It is well established that high RA levels leads to teratogenic effects both in human and experimental models. Brain abnormalities such as microcephaly, impairment of hindbrain development, mandibular and midfacial underdevelopment, and cleft palate are all implicated (Sulik et al., 1988; Clotman et al., 1998). Women with celiac disease are known to have higher rates of infertility, miscarriages, and birth defects in their offspring (Freeman, 2010; Martinelli et al., 2000; Dickey et al., 1996; Collin et al., 1996). Excess RA could be a significant factor in these complications. A possible mechanism by which glyphosate might induce excess RA is via its interference with the CYP enzymes that metabolize RA. There are at least three known CYPs (CYP26A1, CYP26B1 and CYP26C1) that catabolize RA, and they are active in both the embryo and the adult (Taimi et al., 2004). A 1/5000 dilution of glyphosate was sufficient to induce reproducible malformations characteristic of RA exposure in frog embryos (Paganelli et al., 2010). Pathologies included shortening of the trunk, reduction in the size of the head, abnormally small eyes or the presence of only one eye (cyclopia), and other craniofacial malformations in the tadpole. Glyphosate's toxicity to tadpoles has been well demonstrated, as it killed nearly 100% of larval amphibians exposed in experimental outdoor pond mesocosms (Relyea, 2005). According to official records, there has been a recent 4-fold increase in developmental malformations in the province of Chaco, Argentina, where glyphosate is used massively on GMO monocrops of soybeans (Carrasco, 2013). In Paraguay, 52 cases of malformations were reported in the offspring of women exposed during pregnancy to agrochemicals, including anencephaly, microcephaly, facial defects, cleft palate, ear malformations, polydactily, and syndactily (Benítez-Leite et al., 2009). In in vitro studies on human cell lines, DNA strand breaks, plasma membrane damage and apoptosis were observed following exposure to glyphosate-based herbicides (Gasnier et al., 2009). Another factor in teratogenetic effects of glyphosate may be the suppression of the activity of androgen-to-estrogen conversion by aromatase, a CYP enzyme (Gasnier et al., 2009). Ingested vitamin A, a fat-soluble vitamin, is delivered to the blood via the lymph system in chylomicrons, and excess vitamin A is taken up by the liver as retinoic acid for catabolism by CYP enzymes (Russell, 2000). Any remaining retinoic acid that is not catabolized is exported inside LDL particles, and it lingers much longer as retinyl esters in the vasculature in this form (Krasinski et al., 1990). Excess retinoic acid is more readily stored in this way in LDL particles in the elderly. Vitamin A toxicity can lead to fatty liver and liver fibrosis (Russell, 2000) as well as hypertriglyceridemia (Ellis et al., 1986). Vitamin A has a negative effect on cholesterol sulfate synthesis (Jetten et al., 1989), which might negatively impact the liver's ability to maintain adequate supplies of cholesterol sulfate for the bile acids, and therefore also interfere with the supply of cholesterol sulfate to the gastrointestinal tract. In summary, glyphosate's disruption of the CYP enzymes responsible for RA catabolism could lead to an excess bioavailability of RA that could contribute adversely to celiac disease, as well as damaging the liver and leading to teratogenic effects in offspring of exposed individuals. In addition to higher risk to birth defects, individuals with celiac disease have increased risk to infertility (Meloni et al., 1999; Farthing et al., 1982). Increased incidence of hypogonadism, infertility and impotence was observed in a study of 28 males with celiac disease (Farthing et al., 1982). Marked abnormalities of sperm morphology and motility were noted, and endocrine dysfunction was suggested as a probable cause. In studies conducted on Sertoli cells in prepubertal rat testis, exposure to Roundup induced oxidative stress leading to cell death (de Liz Oliveira Cavalli et al., 2013). Roundup induced the opening of L-type voltage dependent calcium channels as well as ryanodine receptors, initiating ER stress and leading to calcium overload and subsequent necrosis. Glutathione was depleted due to upregulation of several glutathione-metabolizing enzymes. This suggests that Roundup would interfere with spermatogenesis, which would impair male fertility.

5 Cobalamin deficiency Untreated celiac disease patients often have elevated levels of homocysteine, associated with folate and/or cobalamin deficiency (Saibeni et al., 2005; Dickey et al., 2008). Species of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium have the capability to biosynthesize folate (Rossi et al., 2011), so their disruption by glyphosate could contribute to folate deficiency. Malabsorption in the proximal small intestine could also lead to iron and folate deficiencies. Cobalamin was originally thought to be relatively spared in celiac disease because its absorption is mostly through the terminal ileum, which is unaffected by celiac disease. However, a recent study found that cobalamin deficiency is prevalent in celiac patients. 41% of the patients studied were found to be deficient in cobalamin (<220 ng/L), and 31% of these cobalamin-deficient patients also had folate deficiency (Dahele & Ghosh, 2001). Either cobalamin or folate deficiency leads directly to impaired methionine synthesis from homocysteine, because these two vitamins are both required for the reaction to take place. This induces hyperhomocysteinemia (Refsum et al., 2001), an established risk factor in association with celiac disease (Hadithi et al., 2009). Long-term cobalamin deficiency also leads to neurodegenerative diseases (Herrmann & Obeid, 2012). Because a deficiency in cobalamin can generate a large pool of methyl-tetrahydrofolate that is unable to undergo reactions, cobalamin deficiency will often mimic folate deficiency. Cobalamin requires cobalt, centered within its corrin ring, to function. We depend upon our gut bacteria to produce cobalamin, and impaired cobalt supply would obviously lead to reduced synthesis of this critical molecule. Glyphosate is known to chelate +2 cations such as cobalt. Glyphosate complexes with cobalt as a dimer [Co(glyphosate)2]3 in fifteen different stereoisomeric configurations, and it is facile at switching among the different stereoisomers, an unusual kinetic property compared to most Co(III) systems (Cusiel, 2005). In fact, studies have revealed that glyphosate inhibits other cytosolic enzymes besides EPSP synthase in plants and microbes that also activate steps in the shikimate pathway (Ganson and Jensen, 1988; Bode et al., 1984). Glyphosate potently inhibits three enzymes in the shikimate pathway in yeast (Bode et al., 1984). It has been confirmed that these other enzymes depend upon cobalt as a catalyst, and glyphosate inhibition works through competitive cobalt binding and interference with cobalt supply (Ganson and Jensen, 1988). It has also been proposed that chelation by glyphosate of both cobalt and magnesium contributes to impaired synthesis of aromatic amino acids in Escherichia coli bacteria (Hoagland and Duke, 1982). Thus, it is plausible that glyphosate similarly impairs cobalamin function in humans by chelating cobalt.

6 Anemia and iron Anemia is one of the most common manifestations of celiac disease outside of the intestinal malabsorption issues (Halfdanarson et al., 2007; Bottaro et al., 1999), and is present in up to half of diagnosed celiac patients. Celiac patients often have both cobalamin and folate deficiency, which can cause anemia, but iron deficiency may be the most important factor (Hershko & Patz, 2008). Celiac patients often don't respond well to iron treatment. Glyphosate's chelating action can have profound effects on iron in plants (Eker et al., 2006; Bellaloui et al., 2009). Glyphosate interferes with iron assimilation in both glyphosate-resistant and glyphosate-sensitive soybean crops (Bellaloui et al., 2009). It is therefore conceivable that glyphosate's chelation of iron is responsible for the refractory iron deficiency present in celiac disease. Erythropoietin (EPO), also called hematopoietin, is a cytokine produced by interstitial fibroblasts in the kidney that regulates red blood cell production. Low EPO levels, leading to a low turnover rate of red blood cells, is a feature of celiac disease (Bergamaschi et al., 2008; Hershko & Patz, 2008). This can lead to megaloblastic anemia, where red blood cells are large (macrocytic) and reduced in number due to impaired DNA synthesis. A recent hematological study on mice exposed to Roundup at subacute levels for just 15 days revealed an anemic syndrome in both male and female mice, with a significant reduction in the number of erythrocytes and in hemoglobin, reduced hematocrit and increased mean corpuscular volume, indicative of macrocytic anemia (Jasper et al., 2012).

7 Molybdenum deficiency Molybdenum deficiency is rarely considered in diagnoses, as it is only needed in trace amounts. However, molybdenum is essential for at least two very important enzymes: sulfite oxidase and xanthine oxidase. Sulfite oxidase converts sulfite, a highly reactive anion, to sulfate, which is much more stable. Sulfite is often present in foods such as wine and dried fruits as a preservative. Sulfate plays an essential role in the sulfated proteoglycans that populate the extracellular matrices of nearly all cell types (Turnbull et al., 2001; Murch et al., 1993; Murch, 1995). So, impaired sulfite oxidase activity leads to both oxidative damage and impaired sulfate supplies to the tissues, such as the enterocytes in the small intestine. The excess presence of sulfur-reducing bacteria such as Desulfovibrio in the gut in association with celiac disease (Collado et al., 2007; Nadal et al., 2007) could be protective, because these bacteria can reduce dietary sulfite to hydrogen sulfide, a highly diffusable gas that can migrate through tissues to provide a source of sulfur for sulfate regeneration at a distant site, as previously discussed. These distal sites could reoxidize the H 2 S through an alternative pathway that does not require molybdenum for sulfur oxidation (Ingenbleek and Kimura, 2013). Xanthine oxidase (XO) produces uric acid from xanthine and hypoxanthine, which are derived from purines. It is activated by iron, which, as we have seen, is often intractably deficient in association with celiac disease. Impaired XO activity would be expected to drive purines towards other degradation pathways. Adenosine deaminase (ADA), a cytoplasmic enzyme that is involved in the catabolism of purine bases, is elevated in celiac disease, and is therefore a useful diagnostic marker (Cakal et al., 2010). In fact, elevation of ADA is correlated with an increase in several inflammatory conditions. Impaired purine synthesis is expected in the context of cobalamin deficiency as well, because methyl melonlyl CoA mutase depends on catalytic action by cobalamin (Allen et al., 1993). Decreased purine synthesis results in impaired DNA synthesis, which then leads to megaloblastic anemia (Boss, 1985), due to slowed renewal of RBC's from multipotent progenitors, a problem that is compounded by suppressed EPO activity (Bergamaschi et al., 2008), a feature of celiac disease. A remarkable recent case of a three-month old infant suffering from molybdenum deficiency links several aspects of glyphosate toxicity together, although glyphosate exposure was not considered as a possible cause in this case (Boles et al., 1993). This child presented with microcephaly, developmental delay, severe irritability, and lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is a striking feature of intentional glyphosate poisoning induced by drinking Roundup (Zouaoui et al., 2013; Beswick & Millo, 2011), and it suggests impaired oxidative respiration, as is seen in E. coli exposed to glyphosate (Lu et al., 2013). In vitro studies of glyphosate in the formulation Roundup have demonstrated an ability to disrupt oxidative respiration by inducing mitochondrial swelling and inhibiting mitochondrial complexes II and III (Peixoto, 2005). This would explain a massive build-up of lactic acid following ingestion of Roundup, due to a switch to anaerobic metabolism. Glyphosate has also been shown to uncouple mitochondrial phosphorylation in plants (Haderly et al., 1977; Ali & Fletcher, 1977). As has been stated previously, microcephaly is a feature of excess RA, which could be induced by glyphosate due to its inhibitory action on CYP enzymes. In the case study on molybdenum deficiency (Boles et al., 1993), urinary sulfite levels were high, indicative of defective sulfite oxidase activity. Serum hypouricemia was also present, indicative of impaired XO activity. So, the induction of excess RA, depletion of molybdenum, and lactic acidosis by glyphosate provide a plausible environmental factor in this case. One final aspect of molybdenum deficiency involves nitrate metabolism. As a source of nitric oxide, inorganic nitrite regulates tissue responses to ischemia. While nitrate reductase activity has been known to be a capability of microbes for many years, it has only recently been realized that mammals also possess a functioning nitrate reductase capability, utilizing a molybdenum-dependent enzyme to produce nitrite from nitrate (Jansson et al., 2008). Molybdenum deficiency would impair this capability, likely contributing to the higher risk to venous thrombosis observed in celiac disease (Zenjari et al., 1995; Marteau et al., 1994, Grigg, 1999). This could also explain the excess nitrates in the urine observed in association with celiac disease (Högberg et al., 2011).

8 Selenium and thyroid disorders Autoimmune thyroid disease is associated with celiac disease (Collin et al., 2002; Valentino et al., 2002). In (Valentino et al., 2002), up to 43% of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis showed signs of mucosal T-cell activation typical of celiac disease. Selenium, whose deficiency is associated with celiac disease (Hinks et al., 1984), plays a significant role in thyroid hormone synthesis, secretion and metabolism, and selenium deficiency is therefore a significant factor in thyroid diseases (Sher, 2000; Chanoine et al., 2001; Khrle, 2013). Selenium is required for the biosynthesis of the “twenty first amino acid,” selenocysteine. Twenty five specific selenoproteins are derived from this amino acid. Selenium deficiency can lead to an impairment in immune function and spermatogenesis in addition to thyroid function (Papp et al., 2007). One very important selenoprotein is glutathione peroxidase, which protects cell membranes and cellular components against oxidative damage by both hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite (ONOO–) (Prabhakar et al., 2006). Wheat can be a good source of selenoproteins. However, the content of selenium in wheat can range from sufficient to very low, depending upon soil physical conditions. Soil compaction, which results from modern practices of “no till” agriculture (Huggins & Reganold, 2008), can lead to both reduced selenium content and a significant increase in arsenic content in the wheat (Zhao et al., 2007). Since glyphosate has been shown to deplete sulfur in plants (Saes Zobiole et al., 2010), and selenium is in the same column of the periodic table as sulfur, it is likely that glyphosate also disrupts selenium uptake in plants. A gluten-free diet will guarantee, however, that no selenium is available from wheat, inducing further depletion of selenoproteins, and therefore increasing the risk to immune system, thyroid and infertility problems in treated celiac patients. The gut bacterium Lactobacillus, which is negatively impacted by glyphosate (Shehata et al., 2013) and depleted in association with celiac disease (Di Cagno et al., 2011), is able to fix inorganic selenium into more bioavailable organic forms like selenocysteine and selenomethionine (Pessione, 2012). Selenocysteine is present in the catalytic center of enzymes that protect the thyroid from free radical damage (Triggiani et al., 2009). Free radical damage would lead to apoptosis and an autoimmune response (Tsatsoulis, 2002). Glyphosate's disruption of these bacteria would lead to a depletion in the supply of selenomethionine and selenocysteine. Methionine depletion by glyphosate (Nafziger et al., 1984) would further compound this problem. Thus, there are a variety of ways in which glyphosate would be expected to interfere with the supply of selenoproteins to the body, including its effects on Lactobacillus, its depletion of methionine, the no-till farming methods that are possible because weeds are killed chemically, and the likely interference with plant uptake of inorganic selenium. This aligns well with the observed higher risk of thyroid problems in association with celiac disease, in addition to infertility problems and immune issues, which are discussed elsewhere in this paper. Further support for an association between glyphosate and thyroid disease comes from plots over time of the usage of glyphosate in the U.S. on corn and soy time-aligned with plots of the incidence rate of thyroid cancer in the U.S., as shown in . Thyroid cancer incidence rate plotted against glyphosate applied to U.S. corn & soy crops (R=0.988, p≤7.612e-09) along with % GE corn & soy crops (R=0.9377, p≤2.152e-05). Sources: USDA:NASS; SEER.

9 Indole and kidney disease The prevalence of kidney disease and resulting dialysis is increasing worldwide, and kidney disease is often associated with increased levels of celiac disease autoantibodies. Kidney disease and thyroid dysfunction are intimately connected (Iglesias & Díez, 2009). A population-based study in Sweden involving nearly 30,000 people with diagnosed celiac disease determined that there was nearly a three-fold increased risk for kidney failure in this population group (Welander et al., 2012). Inflammation plays a crucial role in kidney disease progression (Tonelli et al., 2005; Bash et al., 2009; Rodriguez-Iturbe et al., 2010). Chronic kidney disease develops as a consequence of assaults on the kidney from inflammatory agents, brought on by the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the kidney. The toxic phenol p-Cresol sulfate, as well as indoxyl sulfate, a molecule that is chemically similar to p-Cresol, have been shown to induce activation of many of these cytokines and chemokines (Sun et al., 2012). p-Cresol and indoxyl sulfate both decrease endothelial proliferation and interfere with wound repair (Dou et al., 2004). p-Cresol is produced by the pathogenic bacterium C. difficile, and indoxyl sulfate, derived from indole through sulfation in the liver (Banoglu & King, 2002), accumulates at high levels in association with chronic kidney disease (Niwa, 2010). The aromatic amino acid tryptophan contains an indole ring, and therefore disruption of tryptophan synthesis might be expected to generate indole as a by-product. Indeed, glyphosate has been shown to induce a significant increase in the production of indole-3-acetic acid in yellow nutsedge plants (Caal et al., 1987). Indole is produced by coliform microorganisms such as E. coli under anaerobic conditions. Glyphosate induces a switch in E. coli from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism due to impaired mitochondrial ATP synthesis (Lu et al., 2013; Samsel & Seneff, 2013), which would likely result in excess production of indole. Besides, E. coli, many other pathogenic bacteria can produce indole, including Bacillus, Shigella, Enterococcus, and V. cholerae (Lee & Lee, 2010). At least 85 different species of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria produce indole, and its breakdown by certain bacterial species depends on CYP enyzmes (Lee & Lee, 2010). Feeding indole to rats deprived of sulfur metabolites leads to macrocytic anemia (Roe, 1971). Indole is an important biological signaling molecule among microbes (Lee & Lee, 2010). Indole acetic acid inhibits the growth of cobalamin-dependent microorganisms, which then causes macrocytic (pernicious) anemia in the host due to cobalamin deficiency (Drexler, 1958). Experiments on exposure of mouse fetuses to indole-3-acetic acid have shown that it dramatically induces microcephaly in developing fetuses exposed at critical times in development (Furukawa et al., 2007). A case study found celiac disease associated with microcephaly and developmental delay in a 15-month-old girl (Bostwick et al., 2001; Lapunzina, 2002). A gluten-free diet restored head growth. The authors suggested that poor head growth might precede other manifestations of celiac disease in infants. A study on plants demonstrated a concentration gradient of indole-3-acetic acid in the plant embryo, similar to the gradient in retinoic acid that controls fetal development in mammals (Uggla et al., 1996). This alternative may be another way in which glyphosate would promote microcephaly. Thus, solely through its effect on indole production and indole catabolism in gut bacteria, chronic glyphosate exposure would be expected to lead to cobalamin deficiency, pernicious anemia, microcephaly in a fetus during pregnancy, and kidney failure. p-Cresol supply by overgrown pathogens like C. difficile would likely contribute in a similar way as indole, due to its similar biochemical and biophysical properties.

10 Nutritional deficiencies The damaged villi associated with celiac disease are impaired in their ability to absorb a number of important nutrients, including vitamins B6, B12 (cobalamin) and folate, as well as iron, calcium and vitamins D and K (Hallert et al., 2002). Thus, long-term celiac disease leads to major deficiencies in these micronutrients. Cobalamin deficiency has been well addressed previously. We have also already mentioned the chelation of trace minerals by phytates and by glyphosate. However, other factors may be at play as well, as discussed here. Glyphosate disrupts the synthesis of tryptophan and tyrosine in plants and in gut bacteria, due to its interference with the shikimate pathway (Lu et al., 2013; María et al., 1996), which is its main source of toxicity to plants. Glyphosate also depletes methionine in plants and microbes. A study on serum tryptophan levels in children with celiac disease revealed that untreated children had significantly lower ratios of tryptophan to large neutral amino acids in the blood, and treated children also had lower levels, but the imbalance was less severe (Hernanz & Polanco, 1991). The authors suggested a metabolic disturbance in tryptophan synthesis rather than impaired absorption, as other similar amino acids were not deficient in the serum. It was proposed that this could lead to decreased synthesis of the monoamine neurotransmitter, serotonin, in the brain associated with behavior disorders in children with celiac disease, such as depression (Koyama & Melzter, 1986). Deficiencies in tyrosine and methionine were also noted (Hernanz & Polanco, 1991). “Functional dyspepsia” is an increasing and mainly intractable problem in the Western world, which is estimated to affect 15% of the U.S. population (Saad & Chey, 2006). Dyspepsia, a clinical symptom of celiac disease, is likely mediated by excess serotonin synthesis following ingested tryptophan-containing foods (Manocha et al., 2012). Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) is produced by enterochromaffin (EC) cells in the gut and is an important signaling molecule for the enteric mucosa (Kim et al., 2001). EC cells are the most numerous neuroendocrine cell type in the intestinal lumen, and they regulate gut secretion, motility, pain and nausea by activating primary afferent pathways in the nervous system (Chin et al., 2012). Serotonin plays an important role in activating the immune response and inflammation in the gut, and also induces nausea and diarrhea when it is overexpressed. Anaerobic bacteria in the colon convert sugars into short-chain fatty acids, which can stimulate 5-HT release from EC cells (Fukumoto et al., 2003; Grider & Piland, 2007). This is likely an important source of fats to the body in the case of a low-fat diet induced by impaired fatty acid metabolism due to insufficient bile acids. The number of 5-HT expressing EC cells in the small intestine is increased in association with celiac disease, along with crypt hyperplasia (Wheeler & Challacombe, 1984; Challacombe et al., 1977), and, as a consequence, serotonin uptake from dietary sources of tryptophan is greatly increased in celiac patients (Erspamer, 1986). Postprandial dyspepsia is associated in celiac disease with increased release of 5-HT, and this may account for the digestive symptoms experienced by celiac patients (Coleman et al., 2006). An explanation for these observations is that a chronic tryptophan insufficiency due to the impaired ability of gut bacteria to produce tryptophan induces aggressive uptake whenever dietary tryptophan is available. Glyphosate forms strong complexes with transition metals, through its carboxylic, phosphonic, and amino moieties, each of which can coordinate to metal ions, and it can also therefore form complexes involving two or three atoms of the targeted transition metal (Madsen et al., 1978; Motekaitis & Martell, 1985; Undabeytia et al., 2002). This means that it is a metal chelator par excellence. One can expect, therefore, deficiencies in multiple transition (trace) metals, such as iron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum, zinc and magnesium in the presence of glyphosate. Glyphosate has been shown to reduce levels of iron, magnesium, manganese and calcium in non-GMO soybean plants (Cakmak et al., 2009). We have already discussed iron, selenium, cobalt and molybdenum deficiencies in association with celiac disease. Zinc deficiency seems to be a factor in celiac disease, as a recent study of 30 children with celiac disease demonstrated a significantly reduced serum level of zinc (0.64 vs 0.94 µg/mL in controls) (Singhal et al., 2008). Copper deficiency is a feature of celiac disease (Halfdanarson et al., 2009), and copper is one of the transition metals that glyphosate binds to and chelates (Madsen, 1978; Undabeytia, 2002). Confirmed magnesium deficiency in celiac disease has been shown to be due to significant loss through the feces (Goldman et al., 1962). This would be expected through binding to phytates and/or glyphosate. A study of 23 patients with gluten-sensitive enteropathy to assess magnesium status revealed that only one had serum magnesium levels below the normal range, whereas magnesium levels in erythrocytes and lymphocytes was markedly below normal, and this was associated with evidence of osteoporosis due to malabsorption (Rude and Olerich, 1996). Daily treatment with MgCl 2 or Mg lactate led to a significant increase in bone mineral density, and was correlated with a rise in RBC Mg2+. A recent study investigated the status of 25(OH) vitamin D3 in adults and children with celiac disease (Lerner et al., 2012). It was determined that vitamin D3 deficiency was much more prevalent in the adults than in the children, suggesting a deterioration in vitamin D3 serum levels with age. This could be explained by a chronic accumulation of glyphosate, leading to increasingly impaired vitamin D3 activation in the liver. The liver converts 1,25(OH) vitamin D3 to the active form, 25(OH) vitamin D3, using CYP27A (Ponchon et al., 1969; Sakaki et al., 2005), which might be disrupted by glyphosate exposure, given its known interference with CYP function in mice (Hietanen et al., 1983). On a broader level, this might also explain the recent epidemic in the U.S. in vitamin D3 deficiency (Holick, 2005). Another issue to consider is whether the food being consumed by celiac patients is itself depleted in nutrients. This is likely the case for the transgenic Roundup-Ready crops that increasingly supply the processed food industry. A recent study on the effects of glyphosate on Roundup-Ready soy revealed a significant effect on growth, as well as an interference with the uptake of both macronutrients and micronutrients (Saes Zobiole et al., 2010). Transgenic soybeans exposed to glyphosate are often affected by a “yellow flashing” or yellowing of the upper leaves, and an increased sensitivity to water stress. An inverse linear relationship was observed between glyphosate dosage and levels of the macronutrients, sodium, calcium, sulfur, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, and nitrogen, as well as the micronutrients, iron, zinc, manganese, copper, cobalt, molybdenum, and boron. Glyphosate's ability to form insoluble metal complexes likely mediates these depletions (Glass, 1984). Glyphosate also interferes with photosynthesis, as reflected in several measures of photosynthesis rate (Saes et al., 2010) and reductions in chlorophyll (Ali & Fletcher, 1977; Kitchen et al., 1981). This could be due to depletion of zinc and manganese, since chloroplasts require these micronutrients to function well (Homann, 1967; Thompson & Weier, 1962).

11 Cancer Chronic inflammation, such as occurs in celiac disease, is a major source of oxidative stress, and is estimated to account for 1/3 of all cancer cases worldwide (Ames et al., 1993; Coussens & Werb, 2002). Oxidative stress leads to DNA damage and increased risk to genetic mutation. Several population-based studies have confirmed that patients with celiac disease suffer from increased mortality, mainly due to malignancy (Nielsen et al., 1985; Logan et al., 1989; Pricolo et al., 1998; Cottone et al., 1999; Corrao et al., 2001; Green et al., 2003). These include increased risk to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, adenocarcinoma of the small intestine, and squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus, mouth, and pharynx, as well as melanoma. The non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was not restricted to gastrointestinal sites, and the increased risk remained following a gluten-free diet (Green et al., 2003). Celiac disease is associated with a lifelong risk of any malignancy between 8.1 and 13.3%, with the risk for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma alone being 4.3 to 9.6% (Matheus-Vliezen et al., 1994; Egan et al., 1995). This risk is 19-fold higher than the risk in the general population. Selenium deficiency in association with celiac disease may be a significant factor in the increased cancer risk. Selenium deficiency is associated with increased risk to several cancers, and selenium supplements are beneficial in reducing the incidence of liver cancer and decreasing mortality in colorectal, lung and prostate cancer (Nelson et al., 1999; Björnstedt et al., 2010). Children with celiac disease, whether or not they are on a gluten-free diet, exhibit elevated urinary biomarkers of DNA damage (Zaflarska-Popawska et al., 2010). Human colon carcinoma cells exposed to peptides extracted from wheat responded with a sharp increase in the GSSG/GSH ratio (ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione), a well-established indicator of oxidative stress (Rivabene, 1999). The authors did not provide information as to whether the wheat plants were exposed to glyphosate, but they did suggest that this effect could explain the increased risk to intestinal cancer associated with celiac. Intriguingly, studies on pea plants have shown that glyphosate induces a sharp increase in the GSSG/GSH ratio in plants (Miteva et al., 2003), which suggests that glyphosate contamination could explain the results observed in (Rivabene, 1999). Interestingly, it was noted in 1996 that the incidence of both non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and melanoma had been rising sharply worldwide in recent decades, and so it was decided to investigate whether there might be a link between the two cancers associated with sunlight exposure. Surprisingly, the authors found an inverse relationship between non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and UV exposure. More recently, such UV protection has been reaffirmed in a review of epidemiologic studies on the subject (Negri, 2010). This suggests that vitamin D3 is protective, so vitamin D3 deficiency due to impaired CYP function in the liver could be contributory to increased risk in celiac disease. The incidence of non-Hodgkins lymphoma has increased rapidly in most Western countries over the last few decades. Statistics from the American Cancer Society show an 80% increase since the early 1970's, when glyphosate was first introduced on the market. While there have been only a few studies of lymphoma and glyphosate, nearly all have indicated a potential relationship (Vigfusson & Vyse, 1980; Pavkov & Turnier, 1986; Hardell & Eriksson, 1999; McDuffie et al., 2001; De Roos et al., 2003). A dose-response relationship for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was demonstrated in a cross-Canada study of occupational exposure to glyphosate in men (McDuffie et al., 2001), and a larger study in the U.S. noted a similar result (De Roos et al., 2003). A population-based study in Sweden showed an increased risk to non-Hodgkins lymphoma upon prior exposure to herbicides and fungicides but not insecticides (Hardell & Eriksson, 1999). Glyphosate exposure resulted in an odds ratio of 2.3, although the number of samples was small, and the authors suggested that further study is necessary. A study on mice showed increases in carcinoma, leukemia and lymphoma (Pavkov & Turnier, 1986) and an in vitro mutagenic test on human lymphocytes revealed increased sister-chromatid exchanges (Vigfusson & Vyse, 1980) upon exposure to glyphosate.

12 Proposed transglutaminase-glyphosate interactions Establishing the mechanism by which glyphosate might promote autoantibodies to transglutaminase is a challenging task, not because this possibility seems unlikely but rather because multiple disruptions are plausible. In this section, we present evidence from the research literature that supports various hypotheses for the interaction of glyphosate with the transglutaminase enzymatic pathways. The definitive studies that clarify which of these hypotheses is correct have yet to be conducted. Celiac disease is thought to be primarily caused by ingestion of wheat gluten proteins, particularly gliadin, due to a high concentration of proline- and glutamine-rich sequences, which imparts resistance to degradation by proteases. Transglutaminase autoimmunity arises when specific epitopes of wheat gliadin activate sensitized T-cells which then stimulate B-cell synthesis of IgA or IgM autoantibodies to transglutaminase. Transglutaminase bound to gliadin can induce false recognition by a T-cell. Transglutaminase acts on gluten in wheat to form crosslinks between glutamine residues and lysine residues, producing ammonia as a by-product. Ammonia is known to induce greater sensitivity to glyphosate in plants, and it is common practice to apply ammonium sulfate simultaneously with glyphosate for this reason (Nalewaja & Matysiak, 1993). This enhanced effect is due to ammonium binding to glyphosate at three sites – one on the carbonyl group and two on the phosphonyl group, which displaces cations such as calcium and endows glyphosate with enhanced reactivity. Transglutaminase sometimes only achieves half of its intended reaction product, by converting a glutamine residue to glutamate, and leaving lysine intact, thus not producing the desired crosslink. It has been established that gluten fragments containing “deamidated glutamine” residues instead of the crosslinks are much more highly allergenic than those that contain the crosslinks (Dørum et al., 2010; Qiao et al., 2005). These have been referred to as “celiac disease T-Cell epitopes.” T-cells of celiac patients preferentially recognize epitopes that are augmented with negatively charged deamidated glutamine residues – the product of the reaction when the lysine linkage does not occur. Thus, if there is a mechanism by which glyphosate interferes with crosslink formation, this would explain its ability to enhance gluten sensitivity. A clue can be found from the research literature on glyphosate sensitivity in plants, where it has been determined that the substitution of a lysine residue in a critical locale in EPSP synthase greatly increases sensitivity to glyphosate (Selvapandiyan et al., 1995). Lysine's NH3+ group is highly reactive with negatively charged ions, and this makes it a common constituent of DNA binding proteins due to its ability to bind to phosphates in the DNA backbone. Glyphosate contains a phosphonyl group that binds easily to ammonia and behaves as a phosphate mimetic. It also contains a carboxyl group that substitutes well for the carboxyl group of glutamate, the intended reaction partner. Thus, it seems possible that glyphosate would be drawn to the ammonia released when the glutamine residue is deamidated by transglutaminase, and then the ammonium glyphosate would react with the lysine residue, releasing the ammonia and resulting in the binding of glyphosate to the lysine residue. This would yield a gluten fragment bound to glyphosate that is likely highly allergenic. An analogous EPSP synthase-EPSP-glyphosate ternary complex has been identified in numerous studies on the physiology of glyphosate in plants (Sammons et al., 1995). Research in the food industry has concerned producing breads that, while not gluten free, may contain forms of gluten to which celiac patients are less sensitive. Such research has revealed that enzymatic modification to promote methionine binding to glutamine reduces IgA immunoreactivity (Cabrera-Chávez et al., 2010). Whether methionine binding to glutamine residues in wheat takes place in vivo is not known, but it is established that glyphosate depletes methionine by 50 to 65 percent in plants, as well as the aromatic amino acids (Nafziger et al., 1984; Haderlie et al., 1977). As we have already discussed, glyphosate interferes with cobalt bioavailability for cobalamin synthesis, and cobalamin is an essential catalyst for the conversion of cysteine to methionine. Transglutaminase also cross-links proteins in the extracellular matrix, and therefore is important for wound healing, tissue remodeling, and stabilization of the extracellular matrix. Thus, autoimmunity to transglutaminase leads to destabilization of the microvilli lining the small intestines. Transglutaminase has 18 free cysteine residues which are targets for S-nitrosylation. A cysteine residue is also involved in the catalytic active site. A unique Ca2+ dependent mechanism regulates nitrosylation by NO, mediated by CysNO (S-nitrosocysteine). It was shown experimentally that up to 15 cysteines of transglutaminase were nitrosylated by CysNO in the presence of Ca2+, and this inhibited its enzymatic activity (Lai et al., 2001). Thus, another plausible mechanism by which glyphosate might enhance the development of autoantibodies to transglutaminase is by nitrosylating its cysteines, acting similarly to CysNO. A precedent for this idea is set with research proposing nitrosylation as the means by which glyphosate interferes with the heme active site in CYP enzymes (Lamb et al., 1998). It is conceivable that cysteine nitrosylation by glyphosate at the active site inactivates the molecule, in which case glyphosate is itself acting as an “antibody.”

13 Evidence of glyphosate exposure in humans and animals The US EPA has accepted Monsanto's claim that glyphosate is essentially harmless to humans. Due to this position, there have been virtually no studies undertaken in the US to assess glyphosate levels in human blood or urine. However, a recent study involving multiple countries in Europe provides disturbing confirmation that glyphosate residues are prevalent in the Western diet (Hoppe, 2013). This study involved exclusively city dwellers, who are unlikely to be exposed to glyphosate except through food sources. Despite Europe's more aggressive campaign against GMO foods than that in the Americas, 44% of the urine samples contained quantifiable amounts of glyphosate. Diet seems to be the main source of exposure. One can predict that, if a study were undertaken in the U.S., the percentage of the affected population would be much larger. A recent study conducted on dairy cows in Denmark shows conclusively that the cows’ health is being adversely affected by glyphosate (Krüger et al., 2013a). All of the cows had detectable levels of glyphosate in their urine, and it was estimated that from 0.1 to 0.3 mg of glyphosate was excreted daily from each cow. More importantly, all of the cows had serum levels of cobalt and manganese that were far below the minimum reference level for nutrient sufficiency. Half of the cows had high serum urea, and there was a positive linear relationship between serum urea and glyphosate excretion. High serum urea is indicative of nephrotoxicity. Blood serum levels of enzymes indicative of cytotoxicity such as creatine kinase (CK) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were also elevated. CK is indicative of rhabdomyolysis or kidney failure. High levels of ALP indicate liver damage, and it is often used to detect blocked bile ducts (Kaplan et al., 1983). Thus, the low cobalt levels and the indicators of liver, kidney, and gall bladder stress are all consistent with our previous discussion. The results of this study were also consistent with results of a study on rats exposed experimentally to glyphosate (Beuret et al., 2005) in which Roundup was shown to be even more toxic than its active ingredient, glyphosate. Glyphosate-metal complexes serve to reduce glyphosate's toxicity in the soil to plants, but they also protect glyphosate from attack by microorganisms that could decompose it (Cusiel, 2005). The degree of reactivity of the complex depends on which metals glyphosate binds to, which in turn depends upon the particular soil conditions (Nomura & Hilton, 1977). Glyphosate usually degrades relatively quickly (Vencill, 2002); however, a half-life of up to 22 years has also been reported in conditions where pH is low and organic matter contents are high (Nomura & Hilton, 1977). Therefore, glyphosate may survive much longer in certain soils than has been claimed by the industry, and could be taken up by crops planted subsequent to glyphosate application to kill weeds. A disturbing trend of crop desiccation by glyphosate pre-harvest (O'Keeffe, 1980; O'Keeffe, 1981; Stride et al., 1985; Darwent et al., 1994; Orson & Davies, 2007) may be a key factor in the increased incidence of celiac disease. According to Monsanto, glyphosate was used on some 13% of the wheat area pre-harvest in the UK in 2004. However, by 2006 and 2007, some 94% of UK growers used glyphosate on at least 40% of cereal and 80% of oilseed crops for weed control or harvest management (Monsanto International Sàrl, 2010). An increasing number of farmers now consider the benefits of desiccating their wheat and sugar cane crops with glyphosate shortly before the harvest (Monsanto International Sàrl, 2010). The advantage is improved harvesting efficiency because the quantity of materials other than grain or cane is reduced by 17%, due to a shutdown of growth following glyphosate treatment. Treated sugar cane crops produce drier stalks which can be baled more easily. There is a shorter delay before the next season's crop can be planted, because the herbicide was applied pre-harvest rather than post-harvest. Several pests can be controlled due to the fact that glyphosate is a broad-spectrum herbicide. These include Black grass, Brome grasses, and Rye grasses, and the suggestion is that this would minimize the risk of these weeds developing resistance to other herbicides. A complete list of the latest EPA residue levels for glyphosate as of September 18, 2013 are shown in . Tolerances are established on all crops for both human and animal consumption resulting from the application of glyphosate. Complete list of glyphosate tolerances for residues in food crops in the U.S. as of September 18, 2013, as reported in: EPA: Title 40: Protection of Environment. As glyphosate usage continues unabated, glyphosate resistance among weeds is becoming a growing problem (Waltz, 2010), necessitating a strategy that either involves an increase in the amount of glyphosate that is applied or a supplementation with other herbicides such as glufosinate, dicampa, 2-4D, or atrazine. Agrochemical companies are now actively developing crops with resistance to multiple herbicides (Culpepper, 2000), a disturbing trend, especially since glyphosate's disruption of CYP enzymes leads to an impaired ability to break down many other environmental chemicals in the liver.

14 Kidney disease in agricultural workers Chronic kidney disease is a globally increasing problem (Ramirez-Rubio et al., 2013), and glyphosate may be playing a role in this epidemic. A plot showing recent trends in hospitalization for acute kidney injury aligned with glyphosate usage rates on corn and soy shows strong correlation, as illustrated in , and a similar correlation is seen for deaths due to end-stage renal disease in . Recently, it has been noted that young men in Central America are succumbing in increasing numbers to chronic kidney disease (Trabanino et al., 2002; Cerdas, 2005; Torres et al., 2010; Peraza et al., 2012; Ramirez-Rubio et al., 2013; Sanoff et al., 2010). The problem appears to be especially acute among agricultural workers, mainly in sugar cane fields (Cerdas, 2005; Torres et al., 2010; Peraza et al., 2012). Since we have shown in Section 8 how glyphosate can produce toxic effects on the kidneys through its disruption of gut bacteria, it is fruitful to consider whether glyphosate could be playing a role in the fate of Central American workers in the sugar cane fields. Number of hospitalizations for acute kidney injury plotted against glyphosate applied to com & soy (in 1000 tons). (Figure courtesy of Nancy Swanson). End stage renal disease deaths (ICD N18.0 & 585.6) plotted against % GE corn & soy planted (R=0.9585, p<4.03e-6) and glyphosate applied to corn & soy (R=0.9844, p≤3.704e-09). Sources: USDA:NASS; CDC. (Figure courtesy ... In attempting to explain this phenomenon, physicians and pharmacists have proposed that it may be due to dehydration caused by over-exertion in high temperature conditions, combined with an acute reaction to commonly administered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to treat pain and/or antibiotics to treat infection (Ramirez-Rubio et al., 2013). NSAIDs require CYP enzymes in the liver for detoxification (Agúndez et al., 2009), so impaired CYP function by glyphosate would lead to a far more toxic effect of excessive NSAID administration. Kidney disease among agricultural workers tends to be associated with chronic glomerulonephritis and interstial nephritis, which was proposed in (Soderland et al., 2010) to be due to environmental toxins such as heavy metals or toxic chemicals. Glomerulonephritis is also found in association with celiac disease (Katz et al., 1979; Peters et al., 2003). A Swedish study showed a five-fold increase in nephritis risk in celiac patients (Peters et al., 2003). A strong hint comes from epidemiological studies conducted in Costa Rica (Cerdas, 2005). The demographic features of those with chronic renal failure revealed a remarkably specific pattern of young men, between 20 and 40 years old, with chronic interstitial nephritis. All of them were sugar-cane workers. These authors wrote: ”A specific study of their work environment is needed to determine what in their daily activities puts them at increased risk for chronic renal failure.” Agriculture is an important part of the economy of the state of Louisiana in the United States, and sugar cane is a significant agricultural product. Chemical methods to ripen sugar cane are commonly used, because they can substantially increase the sucrose content of the harvest (Richard & Dalley, 2009). Glyphosate, in particular, has been the primary ripener used in Louisiana since 1980 (Orgeron, 2012). As of 2001, Louisiana had the highest rate of kidney failure in the U.S. (State-Specific Trends in Chronic Kidney Failure – United States, 1990–2001). Louisiana's death rate per 100,000 from nephritis/kidney disease is 26.34 as compared to a U.S. rate of 14.55 (Network Coordinating Council, 2013). The number of patients on dialysis has risen sharply in the last few years. By 2005, it is estimated that 62% of the total harvested hectares of sugar cane in Louisiana were ripened with glyphosate (Legendre et al., 2005). A paper published in 1990 showed that glyphosate applied as a ripener on three different sugar cane varieties grown in Costa Rica produced up to a 15% increase in the sucrose content of the harvested sugar cane (Subiros, 1990). Glyphosate applied before the harvest is the only sugarcane ripener currently registered for use in the U.S. A disturbing recent trend is the repeated application of glyphosate over the course of the season with the hope of further increasing yields (Richard & Dalley, 2009). Responses to the standard application rate (0.188 lb/acre) of glyphosate have been inconsistent, and so farmers are increasing both the amount and the frequency of application. In (Richard & Dalley, 2009), growers are encouraged not to apply glyphosate beyond mid-October, as results are counterproductive, and not to use higher rates in an attempt to improve yield. But it is doubtful that these recommendations are being followed. It is likely, although we have not been able to confirm this, that glyphosate usage has expanded in scope on the sugar cane fields in Central America since 2000, when the expiration of Monsanto's patent drove prices down, and that the practices of multiple applications of glyphosate in the U.S. are also being followed in Central America. Several other ripening agents exist, such as Ethephon, Trinexapacethyl, and Sulfometuron-methyl, but glyphosate is likely growing in popularity recently due to its more favorable pricing and perceived non-toxicity. Larger amounts are needed for effective ripening in regions that are hot and rainy, which matches the climate of Costa Rica and Nicaragua.

15 Discussion In this paper, we have developed an argument that the alarming rise in the incidence of celiac disease in the United States and elsewhere in recent years is due to an increased burden of herbicides, particularly glyphosate exposure in the diet. We suggest that a principal factor is the use of glyphosate to desiccate wheat and other crops prior to the harvest, resulting in crop residue and increased exposure. Strong evidence for a link between glyphosate and celiac disease comes from a study on predatory fish, which showed remarkable effects in the gut that parallel the features of celiac disease (Shenapati et al., 2009). More generally, inflammatory bowel disease has been linked to several environmental factors, including a higher socioeconomic status, urban as opposed to rural dwelling, and a “Westernized” cultural context (Shapira et al., 2010). Disease incidence is highest in North America and Europe, and is higher in northern latitudes than in southern latitudes within these regions, suggesting a beneficial role for sunlight. According to the most recent statistics from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (Grube et al., 2011), the U.S. currently represents 25% of the total world market on herbicide usage. Glyphosate has been the most popular herbicide in the U.S. since 2001, whereas it was the 17th most popular herbicide in 1987 (Kiely et al., 2004). Since 2001, glyphosate usage has grown considerably, due to increased dosing of glyphosate-resistant weeds and in conjunction with the widespread adoption of “Roundup-Ready” genetically modified crops. Glyphosate is probably now the most popular herbicide in Europe as well (Kimmel et al., 2013). Glyphosate has become the number one herbicide worldwide, due to its perceived lack of toxicity and its lower price after having become generic in 2000 (Duke & Powles, 2008). A recent estimate suggests that one in twenty people in North America and Western Europe suffer from celiac disease (Koning, 2005; Fasano et al., 2003). Outdoor occupational status is protective (Sonnenberg et al., 1991). First generation immigrants into Europe or North America are generally less susceptible, although second generation non-Caucasian immigrants statistically become even more susceptible than native Caucasians (Shapira et al., 2010). This may in part stem from the increased need for sunlight exposure given darker skin pigmentation. summarizes our findings relating glyphosate to celiac disease. All of the known biological effects of glyphosate – cytochrome P450 inhibition, disruption of synthesis of aromatic amino acids, chelation of transition metals, and antibacterial action – contribute to the pathology of celiac disease. Illustration of the myriad ways in which glyphosate can be linked to celiac disease or its associated pathologies. (b) Transition metal chelation (c) CYP enzyme inhibition (d) Shikimate pathway suppression Celiac disease is associated with deficiencies in several essential micronutrients such as vitamin D3, cobalamin, iron, molybdenum, selenium and the amino acids, methionine and tryptophan, all of which can be explained by glyphosate. Glyphosate depletes multiple minerals in both genetically modified soybeans (Saes et al., 2010) and conventional soybeans (Cakmak et al., 2009), which would translate into nutritional deficiencies in foods derived from these crops. This, together with further chelation in the gut by any direct glyphosate exposure, could explain deficiencies in cobalt, molybdenum and iron. Glyphosate's effect on CYP enzymes should lead to inadequate vitamin D3 activation in the liver (Hietanen et al., 1983; Ponchon et al., 1969). Cobalamin depends on cobalt, and cobalt-dependent enzymes in plants and microbes have been shown to be inhibited by glyphosate (Bode et al., 1984; Ganson and Jensen, 1988). Glyphosate has been shown to severely impair methionine and tryptophan synthesis in plants (Nafziger et al., 1984), which would reduce the bioavailability of these nutrients in derived foods. There are multiple intriguing connections between celiac disease and microcephaly, all of which can be linked to glyphosate. Celiac disease is found in association with microcephaly in infants (Bostwick et al., 2001; Lapunzina, 2002), and teratogenic effects are also observed in children born to celiac mothers (Dickey et al., 1996; Martinelli et al., 2000). Microcephaly in an infant where confirmed molybdenum deficiency was present (Boles et al., 1993) suggests that molybdenum deficiency could be causal. However, elevated RA also induces microcephaly, as does indole-3-acetic acid, which has been dramatically linked to microcephaly in mice (Furukawa et al., 2007). Elevated RA is predicted as a response to glyphosate due to its expected inhibition of CYP enzymes which catabolize RA in the liver (Lamb et al., 1998; Hietanen et al., 1983). Molybdenum deficiency is expected due to glyphosate's ability to chelate cationic minerals. Glyphosate has been shown to induce indole-3-acetic acid synthesis in plants (Caal et al., 1987), and it induces a shift to anaerobic metabolism in E. coli (Lu et al., 2013), which is associated with indole synthesis. Celiac disease is associated with impaired serotonin metabolism and signaling in the gut, and this feature leads us to propose a novel role for serotonin in transporting sulfate to the tissues. It is a curious and little known fact that glucose and galactose, but not fructose or mannose, stimulate 5-HT synthesis by EC cells in the intestinal lumen (Kim et al., 2001), suggesting a role for EC cells as “glucose sensors.” Glucose and galactose are the two sugars that make up the heparan sulfate chains of the syndecans and glypicans that attach to the membrane-bound proteins in most cells, serving as the innermost constituency of the extracellular matrix (Bernfield et al., 1999). In (Seneff et al., 2012), it was proposed that part of the post-prandial glucose that is taken up by the tissues is temporarily stored in the extracellular matrix as heparan sulfate, and that a deficiency in sulfate supply impairs this process, which impedes glucose uptake in cells. These heparan sulfate units have a high turnover rate, as they are typically broken down within three hours of their initial placement (Turnbull et al., 2001). This provides the cells with a convenient temporary buffer for glucose and galactose that can allow them to more efficiently remove these sugars from the serum. Insufficient sulfate supplies would impair this process and lead to insulin resistance. As is the case for other monoamine neurotransmitters as well as most sterols, 5-HT is normally transported in the serum in a sulfated form. The sulfate moiety must be removed for the molecule to activate it. Therefore, 5-HT, as well as these other monoamine neurotransmitters and sterols, can be viewed as a sulfate “escort” in the plasma. In (Samsel & Seneff, 2013), it was argued that such carbon-ring-containing molecules are necessary for safe sulfate transport, especially in the face of co-present kosmotropes like glyphosate, in order to protect the blood from excess viscosity during transport. Support for the concept that glyphosate gels the blood comes from the observation that disseminated coagulation is a characteristic feature of glyphosate poisoning (Zouaoui et al., 2013). Since glyphosate disrupts sterol sulfation and it disrupts monoamine neurotransmitter synthesis, in addition to its physical kosmotropic feature, it can be anticipated that a chronic exposure to even a small amount of glyphosate over the course of time will lead to a system-wide deficiency in the supply of sulfate to the tissues. We believe that this is the most important consequence of glyphosate's insidious slow erosion of health. An interesting consideration regarding a known link between celiac disease and hypothyroidism (Collins et al., 2012) emerges when one considers that iodide is one of the few chaotropic (structure breaking) anions available to biological systems: another important one being nitrate, which is elevated in the urine in association with celiac disease (Laurin et al., 2003). It is intriguing that the conversion of T4 to T3 (the active form of thyroid hormone) involves selenium as an essential cofactor. Furthermore, iodide is released in the process, thus providing chaotropic buffering in the blood serum. Therefore, impaired conversion due to deficient selenium results in an inability to buffer this significant chaotrope in the blood, despite the fact that chaotropic buffering is likely desperately needed in the context of the kosmotropic effects of glyphosate. While speculative, it is possible that the autoimmune thyroid disease that develops in association with celiac disease is a direct consequence of the inability to activate thyroid hormone due to insufficient selenium. Indeed, celiac patients with concurrent hypothyroidism require an elevated dose of levothyroxine (T4) compared to non-celiac hypothyroid patients (Collins et al., 2012), which could be due to impaired activation to T3. The link between autoimmune (type 1) diabetes and autoimmune thyroiditis is likely tied to deficiencies in selenoproteins leading to apoptosis. Diabetic rats produce significantly less glomerular heparan sulfate in the kidneys than controls, and this is associated with increased albuminurea (Jaya et al., 1993). However, children with type-1 diabetes and celiac disease excrete lower levels of albumin than type-1 diabetic children without celiac disease, suggesting a protective role for celiac disease (Gopee et al., 2013). Wheat is a good source of tryptophan, so it is likely that tryptophan-derived serotonin induces the symptoms of diarrhea and nausea associated with wheat ingestion, but, at the same time, transports available sulfate through the vasculature, to help maintain adequate supplies of heparan sulfate to the glomerulus. Thus, the increased metabolism of dietary tryptophan to serotonin observed in association with celiac disease may help ameliorate the sulfate deficiency problem. Glyphosate's interference with CYP enzymes links to impaired bile-acid production in the liver, which in turn impairs sterol-based sulfate transport, placing a higher burden on serotonin for this task. We have argued here that kidney failure, a known risk factor in celiac disease, is a consequence of depleted sulfate supplies to the kidneys. An alarming increase in kidney failure in young male agricultural workers in sugar cane fields in South America can be directly linked to the recent increase in the practice of using Roundup to “ripen” the crop just prior to the harvest. Furthermore, glyphosate's interference with selenoprotein supply would lead to thyroid dysfunction, which greatly increases risk to kidney disease. We propose here that glyphosate is the key environmental factor contributing to this epidemic, but further investigation is warranted. While we have covered a broad range of pathologies related to celiac disease in this paper, and have shown how they can be explained by glyphosate exposure, there are likely still other aspects of the disease and the connection to glyphosate that we have omitted. For example, in a remarkable case study (Barbosa, 2001), a 54-year-old man who accidentally sprayed himself with glyphosate developed skin lesions six hours later. More significantly, one month later he exhibited symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Movement disorders such as Parkinsonism are associated with gluten intolerance (Baizabal-Carvallo, 2012). shows plots of glyphosate application to corn and soy alongside plots of deaths due to Parkinson's disease. These and other connections will be further explored in future research. Deaths from Parkinson's disease (ICD G20 & 332.0) plotted against glyphosate use on corn & soy (R=0.9006, p≤5.063e-07) and % GE corn & soy planted (R=0.9676, p≤2.714e-06). Sources: USDA:NASS; CDC. (Figure courtesy ...

16 Conclusion Celiac disease is a complex and multifactorial condition associated with gluten intolerance and a higher risk to thyroid disease, cancer and kidney disease, and there is also an increased risk to infertility and birth defects in children born to celiac mothers. While the principal diagnostic is autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase, celiac disease is associated with a spectrum of other pathologies such as deficiencies in iron, vitamin D3, molybdenum, selenium, and cobalamin, an overgrowth of pathogens in the gut at the expense of beneficial biota, impaired serotonin signaling, and increased synthesis of toxic metabolites like p-Cresol and indole-3-acetic acid. In this paper, we have systematically shown how all of these features of celiac disease can be explained by glyphosate's known properties. These include (1) disrupting the shikimate pathway, (2) altering the balance between pathogens and beneficial biota in the gut, (3) chelating transition metals, as well as sulfur and selenium, and (4) inhibiting cytochrome P450 enzymes. We argue that a key system-wide pathology in celiac disease is impaired sulfate supply to the tissues, and that this is also a key component of glyphosate's toxicity to humans. The monitoring of glyphosate levels in food and in human urine and blood has been inadequate. The common practice of desiccation and/or ripening with glyphosate right before the harvest ensures that glyphosate residues are present in our food supply. It is plausible that the recent sharp increase of kidney failure in agricultural workers is tied to glyphosate exposure. We urge governments globally to reexamine their policy towards glyphosate and to introduce new legislation that would restrict its usage.

I have struggled with very mild skin issues my entire life. These skin problems have included severe poison ivy outbreaks in the summer time, responding only to 7 days of oral steroid treatment. I also experienced mild cases of eczema which would come and go.

While in the more distant past I would often seek counsel from a dermatologist who usually prescribed steroid creams to suppress my symptoms, more recently I sought help from my holistic physician. My alternative doctor explained to me that eczema is a signal of an internal imbalance or infection, which my body was trying to eliminate through my skin, the largest organ for detoxification. I felt better addressing and treating the underlying cause, rather than only treating the symptom. Beginning in the Spring of 2008, with the onset of a serious family health crisis, I had begun embracing, seeking and learning about alternative medicine and preferred this approach in resolving most health issues.

In the summer of 2016 I developed more serious eczema which didn’t go away on its own. I saw my alternative doctor expecting that the treatment would be successful as it had been in the past with my milder eczema bouts. I used a round of parasite medication and other remedies, addressing internal imbalance as I had done before. After 6 months of taking various medications, including prescription, homeopathic and herbal, which were based on my meridian assessment, and experiencing no improvement, I decided it was time to move on.

Conventional Medicine and Eczema

More out of curiosity, I saw my PCP and a dermatologist for my eczema, which blistered and covered my right calf for the entire summer. I was told that eczema is an autoimmune disorder with no known cause. Treatments included steroids as a first line of treatment, along with anti-itch medications. A secondary stronger treatment recommendation included the powerful suppressing IV drug Remicaid, a medication also used for inflammatory bowel disease and other autoimmune disorders.

I was desperate to get relief, so I did try a round of prescription steroid creams, which did successfully suppress my symptoms and heal my skin, but as soon as I stopped the cream, the eczema came back even stronger. I knew this would not be my answer, although I desperately wanted a quick fix by this time. I refused to get the steroid shot, recommended by both doctors.

Research into Hidden Causes

I knew that a diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder meant that my body was toxic and fighting an imbalance in my gut most likely, as well as elsewhere. I had been trying to eliminate my heavy metal load for several years using DMSA, both oral and IV, with little success as measured by my steady mercury levels detected through urine chelation challenge testing. I made the common mistake of vaccinating for several years, which is a dangerous source of heavy metals and other toxins. I also had a mercury filling the majority of my life, stemming from a childhood cavity, which was only recently removed.

I did an intensive internet search looking at my favorite trusted health sources. I read some success stories on eliminating eczema using natural approaches, which gave me the necessary hope to carry on in my search and efforts. I found Josh Axe’s book Eat Dirt to be helpful. Interestingly, he also suffered from eczema, although a milder case than mine and he shared his experience in his book.

My 2nd Effort to Eliminate Eczema

As a second serious effort to eradicate my eczema and rebalance my body, I simultaneously consulted with two functional medicine doctors, one trained as a medical doctor and another as a chiropractor. Their testing and treatments overlapped somewhat. They both used Genova diagnostic’s GI Effects Stool test to check on my gut health. My testing showed an overgrowth of bad bacteria and some digestive issues. I eat a very clean diet, so was disappointed by these results, but I also know that metal toxicity can disrupt everything including gut and immune functioning.

I proceeded to take various anti-bacterials, both prescription and herbs, to address the overgrowth of bad bacteria, along with digestive enzymes and detox supplements.

I supplemented these with consumption of Betonite clay and probiotics. I also tried to juice vegetables daily, including carrots, celery, kale, spinach, broccoli and apples. Juicing is known as a powerful immune booster and detoxifier.

My eczema actually worsened for the next two months, spreading to my chest and underarm area with no relief in sight. I was in so much discomfort that I again felt the need to jump ship and try another approach. I was disappointed with my wasted time and money spent on all of my failed protocols up to this point.

Functional medicine can be very helpful, but a major frustration is that this is a new area of practice and most practitioners are still learning and lack years of practical experience and success. Some are more successful than others, but for so many this is a trial and error practice, for both practitioners and patients. Insurance often covers the diagnostic testing, but not often the doctor’s visits and never the supplements. I was fortunate that the MD I was seeing did accept my insurance at the time I was seeing her. Most functional medicine doctors do not accept health insurance, and if so only as out of network providers.

In spite of these limitations, functional medicine is a welcomed and desperately needed form of treatment in our sick care model of healthcare. Current conventional medicine is largely limited to drugs and surgery as primary treatments to address symptoms. While these treatments do offer relief to many conditions, they often miss the boat for most chronic health conditions, including auto-immune disorders. In contrast, functional medicine addresses and treats underlying causes of disease.

An Anti-inflammatory Diet

At about the same time that I began working with the 2 functional medicine doctors, I decided to get serious about my diet, by starting a stricter anti-inflammatory diet. For several months, I gave up eating all sugars (organic raw honey, maple syrup, cane and coconut sugars), gluten and dairy which are all considered inflammatory and hard to digest. I also eliminated most fruits with the exception of minimal amounts of low sugar fruits like organic berries and apples. I only gave up raw milk kefir for a short period of time and added back goat cheese after a few weeks. I am continuing to avoid gluten for now, but since my recent success I have loosened up my dietary restrictions. I only ate occasional organic sprouted or true sour dough bread in the past.

Final Effort and Success in my Eczema Treatment

I consulted next with a fully trained and experienced Chinese medicine physician. I started initially with acupuncture and cupping three times per week. I also began taking various Chinese herbal remedies, as prescribed. The Chinese physician independently diagnosed me with having underlying gut issues and her treatments addressed these. The fantastic thing about Chinese medicine is that they have a 5,000 year history of successful treatments. The major downfall is that it is not commonly practiced in the United States and like functional medicine is mostly not covered by insurance. I am fortunate to have a Chinese doctor close by. Chinese medicine addresses underlying causes of illnesses and aims to rebalance the body in order to restore health.

For the first time, I noticed some improvement in my eczema, very slow at first, but after one month I felt better. I required several more months of Chinese herbs and acupuncture for my “incurable” eczema to resolve, but it did disappear. My acupuncture and cupping treatments lessened from three times weekly, to two times weekly, then once weekly, to bi-weekly. I am taking herbs only once daily now compared to three times per day. It has been around 6 months since I began Chinese medicine treatment. I did purchase a cupping kit and cupped daily at home between treatments for several months.

My Personal Health and Detox Protocol

I followed my own detox protocols including digesting 1 -2 teaspoons of Betonite clay, taking Epsom salt baths and vegetable juicing. This occurred daily during the height of my eczema, although I was not always able to take a bath depending on my symptoms. I now follow this protocol 1-2 times per week. I also take cilantro and chlorella 1-2 times daily to try and detoxify my heavy metals. I take 1 capful of Orthomolecular’s Glutashield which is important for healing the gut, along with milk thistle, a good liver detoxifier.

I eat a nutrient dense diet, following the principals of the Weston Price Foundation. This includes homemade kombucha and raw milk kefir, along with raw sauerkraut. These are all good sources of probiotics.

During the last several months, as stated earlier, I also implemented an anti-inflammatory diet, so followed a strict no sugar, gluten free and dairy free diet for several months. I did allow raw milk kefir and goat cheese. More recently I have added minimal sugars in the form of fruits, some homemade gluten free baked goods and ice cream, mostly made with raw cream and milk.

Life can be stressful and that’s a reality for all of us. I try and use the same strategies which I recommend for my clients. I make it a priority to get good sleep, sunlight, and exercise on a daily basis, along with earthing as much as possible. I try and slow down and spend time relaxing and visiting with friends and family. Lastly, I try and maintain a positive attitude.

Protocols which did Not Help Me

I tried using several high quality essential oils to try and get relief from my eczema symptoms and found none to be helpful. That doesn’t mean it won’t help someone else and I do successfully use peppermint oil for headaches, along with others.

I tried following an anti-histamine diet for several weeks and also took Amy Meyer’s anti-histamine supplements, but noticed no significant change.

Conclusions

Eczema is considered an incurable disease with unknown causes by Western allopathic medicine with steroids and other suppressing drugs being a primary treatment. Steroids work to suppress the immune system, which can provide temporary or more lasting symptom relief, but which does not address the underlying causes of the disorder.

Alternative and functional medicine approaches treat eczema as a signal that there is an underlying imbalance and cause, commonly one’s gut functioning and an overload of toxins which needs addressing. The skin is a major detoxifier so when skin erupts in a rash the body is attempting to eliminate toxins. These approaches work to rebalance one’s gut health and detoxify one’s body of toxins and heavy metals. After the body is rebalanced, eczema can be resolved.

There is no one approach which will work for everyone, but trial and error with alternative approaches can succeed. If one can access traditional Chinese medicine, they have the best track record in treating eczema, but functional medicine approaches have also benefited many. Using a variety of strategies targeting detoxification and healing one’s gut health, along with dietary changes may be one’s best approach.

When we look at the root of the drug and alcohol problems in the affluent Western nations, frustration and misery always rise to the surface. Yet, most people in the world find that hard to believe.

After all, the people in the Western countries are so much wealthier and have such full facility to enjoy themselves that it seems implausible that they would be entrenched in an even bigger drug problem than the poor countries.

The problem is that most people are in the illusion that material wealth alone is sufficient to make a person happy. They are equating happiness and/or satisfaction with material sense enjoyment and that if the person is “enjoying” the bodily senses they will be satisfied.

The lesson to be learned is that if a person could be happy simply by enjoying the senses, there would never be problems associated with frustration and unhappiness.

People in the Western world are very affluent, have full facility for sense enjoyment, have money, have time, have, or could have, good health, and yet are not happy.

Seeing this reality, an intelligent person would ask, WHY?

The answer is simple: sense enjoyment is not enough to satisfy the person.

Yet, according to modern chemicalist philosophy, a person is nothing more than a combination of material chemicals. As such, if one makes the body’s senses happy that should eliminate frustration.

In real life, we see that people have full facility for bodily sense enjoyment but they are still not happy.

So, to understand the problem of alcoholism and drugs one has to go deeper into the subject of frustration and dissatisfaction.

Going deeper shows that despite experiencing sense gratification to the fullest there is still something still not addressed – spiritual starvation.

Alcoholism and the drug problem are merely symptoms of the disease. A disease that many people are reluctant to face.

While unknowingly suffering from this disease, there are people in various stages or degrees of this spiritual starvation.

There are so many that are so unhappy with their lives yet they still carry on with their duties and normal activities but turn to drugs and alcohol to help them forget their purposelessness. And by some weird quirk of fate this drug problem somehow becomes a drug solution.

Let’s say that, for example, a middle-aged man has spent most of his life working to be able to get all the facilities for their sense enjoyment as well as their family’s and has succeeded in doing so.

Then one day he sees that his kids are not satisfied despite all they have been provided with and he realizes that he will have to die one day and leave everything ha has accumulated.

What happens is that the feeling of having wasted many years of his life manifests? He worked his whole life to provide those things he thought would make his family happy and it did not. Now what?

Now the kids see that their parents are unhappy despite having wealth and they experience similar frustrations even though they never had to work for anything.

The vast majority of young people in America have facility for unlimited sense enjoyment that most people in other parts of the world can only dream about.

Being born into affluence means that you can get everything money can buy. Despite this, the kid is still unsatisfied.

Some time ago I wrote about the hippies in the late sixties and early seventies, when millions of young Americans, Europeans, Australians, etc., left their affluent homes and all its comforts, the vast majority of which took just the clothes on their backs and wandered around, living in cramped quarters with other young people, trying to find a deeper meaning of existence.

Unfortunately, most of them did not find a deeper meaning of existence and instead, succumbed to drugs. Why? Because they were trying to forget the meaninglessness of their existence.

Yes, the hippie movement is over, but the massive use of drugs for the purpose of forgetting the meaninglessness of our existence is one of the main effects that the hippie movement had on the greater American and western society as a whole.

To put is another way: a life which has as its central purpose nothing more than material sense enjoyment leads to annihilationism.

The idea that I am merely the material body, that I am matter, just chemicals, leads to hedonism or a life centered around the sole purpose of sense gratification. This leads to frustration, which ultimately leads to thoughts of the desire to cease existing.

There are two ways to try to get rid of pain. One is to try to get rid of the pain; the other is to try to get rid of the experiencer of the pain.

So whether they are pushing drugs, alcohol, annihilationism, or voidism, they are no different than the doctor who “cures” his patients by killing them or hooking them on drugs in the first place.

So all these methods are attempts to decrease one’s awareness of his own existence. And since awareness or consciousness is the characteristic of life itself, the attempt to decrease such awareness is the symptom of the desire to die. This desire to become free from suffering by ending one’s existence is called mukti, or the liberation from suffering.

So, ultimately, the life of endless sense gratification, called bhukti, leads to frustration and misery, which leads to drugs or alcohol in the hopes of achieving mukti or liberation.

This is called the bhukti-mukti syndrome. First, the desire for sense gratification –bhukti –and then the desire for liberation from the purposeless and misery – mukti.

The solution to the bhukti-mukti syndrome is coming to the realization of your actual identity. The realization that we are not the material body but rather the life force within the material body. The body is material matter and temporary and the life force is spiritual and eternal.

We also must learn that we are not God but dominated parts and parcels of God. The realization of these two things will enable one to understand that the purpose of life is not to serve the senses but to somehow be engaged in loving service to God.

You see, we try to find happiness by playing God. In doing so we ultimately become frustrated and spiritually starved.

This can be compared to a finger on the body that is trying to enjoy independently. Imagine your finger sitting in a bowl of food, it’s right in the middle of the food but it can’t quite take the food in.

Seeing this I might tell my finger that to get energy from that food I need to get it to the mouth. From there it goes to the stomach and from the stomach the food is digested and ultimately delivered to me. But, the finger protests and wonders why it has to give it to someone else (the mouth) when all it wants to do is enjoy it directly.

The answer is that it is just not the natural position and function of the finger. That’s the arrangement and there is nothing anyone can do about it.

The only way the finger can get energy is for it to work in coordination with the entire body and help get the food to the stomach.

The same thing applies to the living entity. The living entity is part and parcel of God. We are all parts of Him. If we try to enjoy independently or separately from His concern, then we will not actually experience true satisfaction of joy.

People in the Western world do not understand this. We are sitting in the midst of incredible wealth, just like the finger sitting in the middle of the food.

But so many people are spiritually starving to death because they do not know their actual identity or their relation to God or the purpose of the human form of life.

We wrongly identify ourselves as our bodies. We see ourselves as being the dominator and consider that our natural position is to be master or enjoyer. So we set out on a path of exploitation in life, believing that we can have happiness independently from God.

People need to be spiritually educated as to who and what they are and what their relationship with God is.

Until that happens, we will continue to be bound by selfish interests and endure the bhukti-mukti syndrome endlessly.

The economic development of the West has been built almost entirely upon the desire for their own sense gratification. In other words, for a person to have sense gratification they must secure themselves economically. This is the motivating force. The belief that this sense gratification will make us happy is no longer as strong or convincing in the people as a whole.

There are millions of young people who feel no motivation to make economic advancement. They feel completely without reason to live. They were originally taught that the goal of life is sense gratification and the way to achieve it is to work hard for economic development.

From their own experiences that sense gratification is not enough to satisfy them they no longer have motivation to work and feel hopeless.

So, how do we resolve the conflict? It all starts in your heart where two beings reside: the soul and the Super Soul, aka God. Since God resides in the heart of ALL living beings, He knows your thoughts and desires. If you sincerely want to know Him, He will work it out. All it takes on your part is the sincere desire.

If you understand that God is in your heart does it not stand to reason that your body is truly a temple? As such, why do we continually defile it? Question: would you go into a church/temple/ synagogue/mosque or another place of worship and literally pee or take a dump on the floor? It’s probably the last thing you would do.

So, why then do you continually do it to your body?

You fill your temple with rotting carcasses, with heavy pesticides, GMOs and drugs, both medicinal and recreational, smoke and alcohol, artificial sweeteners, colors and flavors, chemically produced foods, and so many other pollutants and atrocities, and yet wonder why what is happening to you is happening to you.

See your body for the temple that it is and respect the Inhabitant and His part and parcel and maybe, just maybe, one day you will get the surprise of your life by finding out there truly is a God.

Another truth that you may not believe is that the soul inhabits all life forms. As such, the soul goes through an ascending process to another form when it leaves its current body. The ultimate form is the human form, which comes with two choices. One, focus on the world and take on a lower form when leaving the present form. Or, two, focus on developing a relationship with God, which will enable you to resume this activity in your next life until you achieve true love for God and attain life in the spiritual world when you leave the material body.

So, what happens to the soul in the lower material forms like animals, fish, etc.? The soul can only pass to a different form if it leaves that body naturally. When one consumes flesh foods, the soul in that body has to take rebirth in the same body type until is can pass naturally.

You that eat flesh foods are inhibiting the ascending process of the souls in the material bodies that you eat. And, trust me, karma is a bitch! Why do you think in Genesis in the Old Testament, God instructed us to eat plant-based foods and only allowed the eating of flesh foods if they were produced a certain specific way and only if the environmental condition warranted flesh consumption?

Aloha!

“Lithium: The Gift That Keeps Giving in Psychiatry” is the headline for a panel at the 2017 annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association (APA). The psychiatrists tout the value of this prescription neurotoxin—including as a natural cure found in drinking water. This drug is FDA-approved to suppress manic episodes and it is also prescribed without FDA approval to level depression and to prevent suicide, all of which lacks a sound scientific basis. What makes lithium such a gift for psychiatry? It is the most poisonous and specifically neurotoxic drug in psychiatry. The most brain-damaging treatments are always among the most lauded as cures in psychiatry, hence the popularity of antipsychotic drugs and electroshock. They most obviously and dramatically suppress the individual’s feelings, thoughts and activities. The final common effect of all psychiatric interventions from Ritalin and Prozac to Risperdal and other psychiatric drugs is suppression of the person’s feelings.

In 1983, I first began ridiculing the promotion of lithium in our drinking water. I never dreamed the idea would be as alive as ever in 2017. The Harvard doctors reviewed the admittedly contradictory and speculative evidence concerning whether or not communities with higher natural levels of lithium have improved mental health. The concept is ridiculous, of course. Never mind flawed studies of drinking water. Diehard advocates cannot even produce scientific studies demonstrating any long-term benefit for any human problem, while it is relatively easy to show long-term harm to brain function and cognition, as well as withdrawal mania from the neurotoxin. Long-term lithium psychiatric drug treatment causes a syndrome called SILENT: Syndrome of Irreversible Lithium-Effectuated Neurotoxicity. SILENT includes permanent impairments of walking, speaking, and higher mental functions. Lithium treatment causes indifference, social withdrawal and cognitive dysfunction in normal volunteers. Routine treatment can damage the kidneys, thyroid and other organs.

How neurotoxic is lithium? This substance is so neurotoxic that patients must have blood drawn periodically to test the concentration of the neurotoxin in the blood. Slight variations in it’s blood concentration can become so neurotoxic that patients can sicken and die without realizing what is happening. It is so neurotoxic that it causes lethargy, fatigue, flaccidity and other neurological abnormalities in newborns and nursing infants of mothers prescribed lithium. Lithium levels in the water are relatively minuscule compared to the sometimes deadly and always destructive levels brought about in the human blood stream by prescription. These small exposures in drinking water have no known effect on human beings. So why bring up such a boneheaded idea as lithium in the drinking water? Because it may influence equally boneheaded psychiatrists to ignore the extreme dangers of the drug in order to give more of it to adolescents as the APA panel also advocates. Nothing misleads well-meaning parents more than a brief reference by their trusted child psychiatrist to lithium being “a natural substance” already found in drinking water and thought to be helpful. The doctors will not remind these parents that some of the most poisonous minerals and elements are “natural,” that is, are found in nature. “Natural” poisons include mercury, lead, asbestos, arsenic, and ionizing radiation. Freedom requires a drug-free mind Psychiatry—always looking for answers in all the wrong places. But maybe these drug advocates know what they are doing. One of the most obvious effects of lithium on people and animals is the overall suppression of voluntary activity or willpower. All creative and spontaneous behavior is reduced. Do you want to remain a free and independent person? Then stay alert for plans to put lithium in your drinking water. Meanwhile, avoid the use of lithium as a psychiatric drug for you and your family members. As I describe in Psychiatric Drug Withdrawal, if you are already taking lithium, then consider obtaining experienced professional help in withdrawing from the drug, while exercising caution because lithium withdrawal can cause mania.

(Natural News) Just when you thought the wholly discredited “fake news” media couldn’t go any lower, CNN pulls out yet another sleaze tactic that smacks of the very same “journo-terrorism” I first warned about last year.

Over the July 4th holiday, CNN managed to acquire the identity of the Reddit user who created the hilarious Trump vs. CNN mock wrestling video that has taken the internet by storm. His Reddit username is HanAssHoleSolo, but CNN threatened to go public with his real name if he didn’t apologize for making the video, saying:

CNN is not publishing “HanAssholeSolo’s” name because he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology… CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change.

And just like that, CNN went “full mafia” on a private citizen, invoking blackmail threats to expose the identity of this Reddit user who made a silly satire video. Maybe next the geniuses at CNN will also threaten 4Chan and Anonymous, just ‘cuz they’re stupid enough to think that might be an amazing idea.

We’re also seeing unconfirmed reports that CNN may have acquired the identity of the user by having its parent company, Time Warner, spy on the user’s internet activities the same way the NSA spies on everybody else. This is not yet confirmed, but given the sleaze tactics already invoked by CNN, nothing would surprise me at this point.

In any case, the backlash against CNN has been nothing short of epic:

“CNN and Andrew Kaczynski, head of the network’s Republican oppo research unit “KFILE,” gave a misleading defense after receiving an intense backlash to a Sunday night post boasting that he had tracked down and identified a man who claimed credit for a gif shared by President Donald Trump — and that CNN may reveal his identity if the man chooses to “repeat this ugly behavior'” reported Breitbart News:

Dozens of celebrities, commentators, politicians, and journalists criticized the network, all across the political spectrum — from Donald Trump Jr. to YouTuber Philip DeFranco to WikiLeaks to anti-Gamergate stalwart Brianna Wu. The hashtag #CNNBlackmail became the number one trending topic on Twitter, with many critics calling the sentence about CNN “reserving the right” to release the man’s name as a “threat” to “dox” him.

CNN is running “weaponized journalism” to threaten and silence critics of the fake news mainstream media

Essentially, CNN is now functioning as a mafia boss enforcer, fulfilling the “journo-terrorism” label I gave the network back in 2016. Here at Natural News, we’ve called CNN’s tactics weaponized journalism. That’s especially ironic, given that CNN absurdly claims President Trump’s tweets against CNN’s fake news will somehow result in journalists being targeted and killed around the world.

Via the Daily Caller:

“Trump was bad. CNN is worse: CNN threatens amateur satirist behind Trump video: make fun of us again and we dox you,” WikiLeaks wrote on Twitter.

“I can’t emphasize how bad this is on CNN’s part,” wrote German Lopez, a reporter for liberal website Vox. “This is basically ‘don’t post stuff we don’t like or we’ll dox you.’ Extremely unethical.”

“That’s essentially blackmail. That’s CNN stating that it will out the guy if he dares to defy their political perspective or offends them sufficiently,” wrote conservative commentator Ben Shapiro. “The whole story is frightening, and obviously an attempt to both nail Trump and discourage people from smacking CNN.”

Others leveled similar criticisms at CNN for the piece, with many using the hashtag #CNNBlackmail, which quickly became the top trending hashtag on Twitter.

The history books will show that on #july4th2017 CNN blackmailed someone who made a joke gif about them. #CNNBlackmail — Mark Dice (@MarkDice) July 5, 2017

The internet has responded to CNN’s blackmail threat by creating a huge number of new video memes showing Donald Trump giving CNN a well-deserved beat down across a variety of mixed martial arts and sporting activities:

(Natural News) You don’t have to be a geologist to understand that an earthquake in the vicinity of a volcano could be a disaster waiting to happen, but what if there were nearly 900 quakes near a supervolcano?

That is the situation that is playing out right now in Yellowstone National Park, where 878 earthquakes have struck since June 12. Most of the quakes had a very low magnitude, but the strongest one, which was recorded on June 15, had a magnitude of 4.4. The park rests atop one of the most dangerous supervolcanoes on the planet, prompting fears that it could be about to blow. Any doubts about its active state can be dispelled by the sight of Old Faithful, shooting water up every few hours.

While earthquake swarms are not unusual in Yellowstone, the week of June 12 saw the highest number of quakes to be noted in a single week in five years. Although the risk of eruption remains low overall and the volcano alert level has not been raised from green, it is believed that if it does erupt, it could be 1,000 times as powerful as the one at Mount St. Helens in 1980.

This particular volcano has been dormant for more than 70,000 years, but that does not mean it won’t erupt again eventually. It’s impossible to predict when that might occur, but seismic activity can signal a potential eruption. Four years ago, researchers discovered that the underground magma chamber of the volcano was more than twice as big as previously believed, encompassing an area of land that measures 56 by 19 miles.

Huge ash cloud could devastate Western U.S.

Should the volcano erupt, the resultant ash, smoke and lava would most likely cause widespread devastation in this country and also have an effect on the rest of the world. It is believed that an eruption there would see molten lava hotter than 1,000 degrees, but the biggest concern is the ash. Scientists believe it could emit ash that extends over 500 miles, stretching from California all the way to Texas and Louisiana. It would likely leave as many as four inches of gray ash on the ground, destroying Midwestern crops.

It could also spew out gases like sulfur dioxide, creating acid rain and leading to global cooling by reflecting the sun from the Earth. While it might not wipe out human life entirely, it would certainly create a lot of damage across the western side of our nation.

Another concern in that part of the country is a gigantic well of molten carbon that was discovered under the park earlier this year. Spanning 700,000 square miles, this section of upper mantle is about the size of Mexico and creates specific seismic patterns as solid carbonates melt. If a significant amount of the gases in this deposit are suddenly released into our atmosphere, it could spur an environmental disaster akin to nuclear warfare.

As for the Yellowstone supervolcano, it has only had three major eruptions in the last 2 million years. Geologists say that other signs would also likely occur if the volcano was on the verge of blowing, such as big changes in the surface deformation, gas output, and the hydrothermal system.

Even though this latest round of earthquakes will likely – and hopefully – amount to nothing just like similar earthquake swarms in the past, the news serves as a reminder that it never hurts to prepare for events like this one. Waiting for more signs of impending doom, whether it’s a volcano or another type of threat, will place you in competition with other people for scarce resources, so the time to start stocking up and making a plan is now.

(Natural News) There is a reason that people have learned reading, writing and arithmetic in generally the same way over the years, and that’s because the tried-and-true traditional methods work. That’s why many people wondered what the real agenda of the Common Core national standards were when the Obama administration started pushing for it so relentlessly. This ridiculous set of educational standards has left many students and parents baffled and frustrated, and it’s believed to be a key reason that American kids are lagging behind other nations in academic performance. What would happen if we got rid of it entirely? If the results gained by one Florida school are any indication, we would likely all be much better off.

Mason Classical Academy, a charter school in Naples, Florida, prides itself on providing a classical education, which it believes brings about “superior educational results” – and leading the county in English Language Arts is proof they’re on the right track.

They have rejected the backward approach of Common Core, which sees kids memorize entire words in kindergarten before later being introduced to phonics once they are in elementary school. By that point, their brains are already used to whole words, which makes grasping the concept of phonics and applying it far more difficult than it needs to be.

What does the classical approach embraced by the Academy entail? According to their website, language-focused learning based on written and spoken words makes the brain work harder to convert words into concepts, while image-based approaches encourage passivity. The time-tested approach of phonics is very likely the reason you are able to read this article in the first place, and it’s hard to imagine why anyone would consider it inadequate.

Thanks to the classical approach of phonics, an impressive 90 percent of the third-grade students at Mason Classical Academy were proficient in English Language Arts, compared to just 58 percent in the county overall, most of whom rely on Common Core. In fact, the MCA third-graders were in Florida’s top two percent, while fifth graders from the academy ranked in the state’s top one percent.

These students look even better when you compare them to California, where the state average is just 43 percent proficiency among third graders. Even worse, six public schools in Baltimore do not have a single student who is proficient in either English Language Arts or math. It’s almost like students are being set up to fail.

Of course, not everyone is happy about this school’s success. Common Core proponents are panicking because these results expose the system for the fraud that it is. The school has been on the receiving end of criticism from everyone from the district’s superintendent to the local news outlet Naples Daily News, according to The Freedom Project.

Why is Common Core setting students up to fail?

Among the many criticisms of Common Core is the fact that it is so strongly focused on test results and teachers are so worried about losing their jobs if their students don’t perform that kids are forced into busywork, missing out on the valuable opportunity to develop social skills and boost their well-being through recess outdoors. It also stifles creativity and stresses children out, which can adversely affect their emotional and physical health.

One of its defining characteristics is the way it “dumbs down” many concepts and has students take too many steps to reach conclusions that are obvious to those of us who were schooled the traditional way.

For example, many people were outraged when a second-grade student’s homework went viral after a correct math answer was marked wrong by the teacher because it wasn’t “friendly.” When asked to solve 530-270, the student arrives at the right answer by subtracting the way most of us were taught in school. Although the student got the right answer, his teacher wanted him to solve it by adding 30 to both numbers so the problem would then be 560-300. There are countless other examples of homework just like this one that illustrate how Common Core is unnecessarily confusing and focused on all the wrong things.

(Natural News) A report released on Thursday, June 22 by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) showed that 212 people each day in the years 2015 to 2016 — or about 77,000 admissions — had been treated in Canadian hospitals for alcohol poisoning, alcohol withdrawal, liver disease, alcohol abuse, and other conditions that are “100 percent caused by the harmful consumption of alcohol”. This meant that more people were hospitalized due to alcohol-related reasons than heart issues such as heart attacks. This number did not include people who were treated in an emergency room and released.

Excessive drinking has been known to cause serious diseases such as pancreatitis, liver cirrhosis, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. In severe cases, it has been known to cause death. According to a study by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation as cited by CIHI, there were 5,082 alcohol-related fatalities in Canada in 2015. (Related: Drinking Alcohol Raises Breast Cancer Risk as Much as Smoking Cigarettes.)

The Public Health Agency of Canada has stated that excessive alcohol consumption is the leading cause of injury in Canada, as it leads to instances of impaired driving.

Alcohol-related sicknesses cost to Canada’s health care system

In the years 2014 to 2015, the average hospitalization cost of people who were confined due to alcohol consumption reasons reached $8,100, higher than the average hospital stay for other causes, which was $5,800. This is because people who were hospitalized due to alcohol consumption reasons stayed longer in the hospital (approximately 11 days ) as compared with people who got hospitalized due to other reasons (seven days).

Alcohol-related hospitalizations occurred more frequently in territories than in provinces, and more in the west than in the east, with the exception of Nova Scotia.

Alcohol-related hospitalizations in Ontario, the North West local health integration networks (LHIN), which includes Thunder Bay, were estimated at 603 hospitalizations per 100,000 people, which is more than twice the national average. The North West Territories hospitalization rates for alcohol took the cake at 1,315 hospitalizations per 100,000 people – making it the highest rate for alcohol-related hospitalizations in the country.

In the Champlain region, including Ottawa, alcohol-related hospitalizations fell below the national average, but were higher than the Toronto and Mississauga regions. In 2014 to 2015, there were 166,000 hospitalizations per 100,000 individuals in Champlain as compared with the national average of 239.

Canadian Population Health Initiative at CIHI director Jean Harvey said one of the main reasons why alcohol-related death, injuries, or diseases were so prevalent in Canadian society was because alcohol consumption is ingrained in the culture; as a matter of fact, 80 percent of people in Canada are allowed to drink.

According to CIHI, the difference in the rates of alcohol-related diseases and injuries was due to different “alcohol policy landscapes” across Canada.

In addition, pricing controls factor in to this equation. Some regions set minimum prices for items at retail, others have minimum prices at bars and restaurants, and others index the price of alcohol to inflation or alcohol content.

“For us, those differences represent opportunities for potential improvement. Measuring this, and monitoring these rates can help us identify whether the policies and approaches are effective in reducing alcohol harm,” Geoff Hynes, manager of the Canadian Population Health Initiative for CIHI, said.

Hynes added that pricing is “one of the most effective and cost-effective ways to reduce alcohol harm, population-wide”.

According to a report released last year by Ottawa Public Health entitled Let’s Continue the Conversation, it is more likely for men over the age of 20 to be hospitalized for drinking alcohol drinking than for women in the same age group. However, among children between the ages of 10 and 19, girls are more likely to be hospitalized for alcohol consumption than boys.

(Natural News) Lovers of full-fat milk rejoice: Your dairy drink of choice is no longer the so-called “worst” variety of milk on the market. What was once maligned for supposedly contributing to weight gain and heart disease has since been redeemed by numerous health studies. According to the DailyMail.co.uk, the warnings against full-fat milk could, in fact, be considered pure myth.

Take for example the outrageous claim that full-fat milk can and will make you fat. A 2016 study has stated otherwise. Based on a long-term study of over 18,000 middle-aged women, the researchers discovered that high-fat dairy actually reduced the likelihood of becoming overweight. However, the same couldn’t be said for low-fat dairy. This may be because full-fat dairy actually makes you feel fuller and prevents you from overeating. “By eating the full-fat form of dairy products, you might actually eat fewer calories throughout the day than you would otherwise,” explained Brian Quebbemann, a bariatric surgeon from the Chapman Medical Center in California.

And what of the connection between milk (full fat, low fat, or otherwise) and heart disease? Well, according to a recent study published in the European Journal of Epidemiology, the connection is essentially non-existent. The analysis of 29 studies, which were carried out over a 35-year period, found no association linking coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease to dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt.

Moreover, regularly drinking full-fat milk could help protect you against diabetes. This was the conclusion researchers of a 15-year study came to; specifically, people who consumed the most dairy fat were 46 percent less likely to develop type-2 diabetes compared to those who consumed the least amount of dairy fat. Once again, this can be backed up by science: the fat in full-fat dairy delays the absorption of milk sugar, and as a result blood sugar and insulin will rise at a much slower pace. The less insulin there is circulating around the body, the lower the risk of developing insulin resistance and diabetes.

With all of these in mind, it’s safe to say that full-fat milk is one of the, if not the best, milk varieties available in the market. But before you head down to your local grocery to stock up your fridge with a few cartons, note that not all full-fat milks are made equal. In fact, some may actually harm you in the long run simply because their fat isn’t of the healthy sort.

Most full-fat milks undergo pasteurization in order to increase shelf life and kill any dangerous bacteria found in the milk. Unfortunately, this process results in nutritional content degradation. Beneficial enzymes and vitamins either die out during pasteurization or become deteriorated. Fats are no exception; pasteurization destroys the chemical integrity of the healthy fats and makes them more susceptible to spoilage. Furthermore, the absence of fats greatly interferes with the solubility of certain important nutrients found in milk, namely vitamins A, D, E, and K.

So what milk should you be drinking, then? Raw, non-homogenized milk, of course. This type of milk is packed with saturated fats, the healthiest and most stable fat for human consumption. In addition to helping your body absorb milk vitamins, the fats found in raw milk contain anti-inflammatory properties. Raw milk also has a higher fat content than most commercial whole milks: four percent fat against the standard 3.5 percent. This isn’t even taking into consideration the numerous other health benefits of raw milk, which include but aren’t limited to being loaded with friendly microorganisms, bioavailable vitamins, as well as offering protection against allergies.

(Natural News) New research further validates the efficacy of cannabis in the alleviation of migraine symptoms. Researchers have found that a combination of tetrahydrocannabinol-cannabidiol (THC-CBD) was effective in reducing the severity and number of cluster headaches and migraines compared to prescription medicine. In fact, the THC-CBD treatment was able to reduce acute pain brought on by migraines by 43.5 percent.

A lecturer in mental health at the University of York, Ian Hamilton, says on the DailyMail.co.uk, “This research suggests that compounds found in cannabis are as effective as amitriptyline, a traditional prescription medication used to treat acute painful headaches. This provides promise for people who experience adverse effects from prescription medication. The analgesic properties of cannabis have been known for some time so this research adds to existing evidence of the potential that cannabis compounds have in the treatment and management of common health problems.”

For this study, researchers observed 79 volunteers who reported suffering from migraines and cluster headaches. Both conditions can be debilitating, although they typically have different causes and symptoms. Cluster headaches come suddenly and are usually centered around a specific area of the head. Migraines, on the other hand, vary in intensity and can have additional symptoms such as nausea and light sensitivity.

Participants with cluster headaches were either given a daily dose of 200 mg of THC-CBD or 25 mg of amitriptyline for three months. Similarly, those with migraines were offered 200 mg of THC-CBD whenever they felt acute pain caused by their condition.

It was concluded that the combination drug of THC-CBD reduced the number of cluster headaches by 40.4 percent, whereas amitriptyline was only effective in reducing the number of headaches 40.1 percent of the time. THC-CBD proved to be effective in reducing acute pain caused by migraines by 43.5 percent. Most notably, the side effects associated with the THC-CBD treatment were significantly less than prescription drugs. (Related: These five strains of medical marijuana ease migraines.)

Lead researcher of the study, Dr. Maria Nicolodi, said, “We were able to demonstrate that cannabinoids are an alternative to established treatments in migraine prevention. That said, they are only suited for use in the acute treatment of cluster headaches in patients with a history of migraine from childhood on.”

Dr. Nicolodi noted that the THC-CBD treatment can also lead to fewer stomach aches, reduced pain in the muscles, and reduced symptoms of colitis (inflammation of the colon). However, THC-CBD can induce drowsiness and cause difficulties in concentration.

Medical marijuana for migraine treatment

This study adds to the body of research which shows a positive relationship between medical marijuana and the reduction of migraine symptoms. A 2016 study published in Pharmacotherapy found that using medical marijuana decreased the frequency and severity of migraine headaches. The authors of this study wrote that migraine frequency among their participants decreased from an average of 10 headache incidences a month to a mere four. Moreover, positive effects from the marijuana treatment were reported in 40 percent of the participants.

Take note that the FDA has not recognized or approved marijuana as medicine. However, the group did note on their website that, “The FDA understands that caregivers and patients are looking for treatment options for unmet medical needs. More recently, several states have also passed laws that remove state restrictions on health care professionals using marijuana as a medical treatment for a variety of conditions. A number of other states are considering similar legislation regarding the use of marijuana in medical settings. We have talked to several states, including Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, New York and Pennsylvania, who are considering support for medical research of marijuana and its derivatives to ensure that their plans meet federal requirement and scientific standards.”

(Natural News) There is no doubt that human activity is hurting our planet, whether it’s all the plastic winding up in our oceans or widespread deforestation. However, it’s a bit inaccurate to pin all the blame on people, particularly when it comes to issues like climate change and carbon dioxide emissions. Besides the fact that the threat is sometimes overblown, it’s important to keep in mind that the contribution of human activity to these problems is actually quite small when compared to natural phenomena like volcanoes and ocean life.

This is perfectly illustrated by a recent study that was carried out by a team of climate scientists from all over the world led by the University of Exeter. After an in-depth examination of the environmental effects caused by the Holuhraun eruption in Iceland in 2014-2015, they discovered that it emitted sulfur dioxide at a far higher rate than each of the 28 countries in Europe combined, creating a gigantic plume of sulfate aerosol particles above the North Atlantic Ocean.

This eruption gave scientists the perfect opportunity to study the interaction between clouds and aerosols, and their findings challenged several existing climate models. Their results could help improve the accuracy of future climate change predictions. While sulfate aerosol has been considered the most significant atmospheric aerosol coming from industrial sources, this serves as a reminder of the impact of sulfate aerosol from natural sources, such as this volcanic eruption.

The Holuhraun eruption emitted as many as 100,000 tons of the chemical each day while it was erupting. After studying the complex cloud cover that was formed as a result, the scientists discovered that the water droplets produced were smaller. This caused cloud brightening, which reflects a higher fraction of incoming sunlight back into space and has the effect of cooling the climate.

However, the most interesting part was the fact that the aerosols did not seem to affect other cloud properties, like the amount of liquid water the clouds were able to hold. This indicates that clouds have something akin to a buffer protecting them from aerosol changes in the environment.

Ocean life creating carbon dioxide

When it comes to carbon dioxide, the human contribution pales in comparison to that of natural phenomena. Biological activity in the ocean is responsible for creating around 90 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually, which is far more than the six billion tons produced by humans. The oil and coal industries might be deplorable for other reasons, but their carbon dioxide output is just a drop in the bucket. Moreover, studies show that the slight rise in carbon dioxide levels has set off a sort of “global greening” that sees new forest growth, higher food production, and better plant cover. It should go without saying that these effects are actually quite positive.

Solar activity is another factor that can play a big role in short-term and long-term climate change, with variations in the energy output of the sun, geomagnetic activity and sunspots contributing to the sun’s influence on the Earth’s climate.

Of course, we can and should do everything that we can to minimize the impact that human activity has on the environment. Studies show that while the impact humans have on the natural environment continues to grow, it is now doing so at a slower rate than the current population and economic growth, which indicates that humans are actually getting better when it comes to managing what they take from the environment. The researchers believe this could be because environmental pressures reach their highest point when industrial societies enter the early stages of their development and then slow down as markets modernize. However, there is no doubt that there is plenty more that can be done, particularly when it comes to issues like pollution and the use of toxic chemicals like glyphosate.

(Natural News) Trump haters are in abundance these days, and millions of civilized Americans have turned into seething, writhing hate machines that all seem like they would love nothing more than to participate in a public stoning or hanging of any Trump supporter, or better yet, POTUS himself. But, why is that? It’s because many people read lying, fanatical newspapers such as the New York Times and the Washington Post, front to back, every morning, and rely on CNN or MSNBC for their broadcast news, feeding themselves a relentless assault of fake news, toxic food ads and poisonous direct-to-consumer (DTC) medicine commercials – all of which they consume like an excited child eating candy on Halloween night.

Within weeks, every Trump hater will forget everything they heard and read and the scripted “Hate-everything-Trump” news will recycle more lies and propaganda for them to consume. It’s a vicious cycle that breeds vicious Neanderthals who walk around with smart devices spewing their brainwashed leftist venom on social media and suffering daily road rage. So the big question is: Where’s it all heading?

The FDA is under Executive Order to implement directives that have been rescinded, possibly including banning all drug commercials from television

Trump signed a directive (this past February) as an Executive Order that requires all Federal agencies to create regulatory reform task forces to help “alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens placed on the American people.” The biggest burden of them all is the unethical, unnecessary coercion of people to ask their doctors for experimental, chemical-based drugs they see advertised relentlessly between news segments on network television. These DTC commercials were all illegal before 1997 and righteously so.

Part of the Executive Order states that:

[E]ach federal agency’s Regulatory Reform Task Force shall evaluate existing regulations and make recommendations to the agency head regarding their repeal, replacement or modification, consistent with applicable law.

At a minimum, according to the order, each Regulatory Reform Task Force shall attempt to identify regulations that: …

(vi) Derive from or implement Executive Orders or other Presidential directives that have been subsequently rescinded or substantially modified.

Take away CNN’s “Hate-everything-Trump” propaganda and their advertising revenue from Big Pharma and CNN would go bankrupt virtually overnight. Here’s why. During the election debates last November, CNN was charging 40 times its usual price for advertising spots during the Republican Debate. That means CNN was making $200,000 every 30 seconds they advertised symptom cover-up medicines that breed more chronic illnesses across our country.

By milking fake, anonymously-sourced news, fabricated “dossiers,” hypothetical “memos,” and cross-sourcing other fake news outlets like the New York Times and the Washington Post, CNN brews and stews lies about Trump that gets their brainwashed fans all worked up and addicted. All of that propaganda was recently ousted by Project Veritas, that caught CNN producers and anchors admitting the whole Trump-Russia collusion is all “bullsh*t” and a big “nothing burger.”

Help make President Trump aware that if his FDA bans pharma commercials, CNN will go bankrupt next year

Nearly every day since Trump won the election, he has tweeted out or announced in a press conference that CNN, the New York Times and the Washington Post are fake news, and he’s right. That’s one big reason he won – because he called out the lying propaganda-filled media that tens of millions of Americans recognized was a major tool for the dangerous wave of communism and socialism that almost completely imploded this country. It’s time for Trump to de-fund the entire fake news media with one swing of his pen.

Currently, Big Pharma ad revenues are propping up the biggest fake news rag of them all – the “Counterfeit News Network” (CNN). You see, DTC drug advertising is illegal everywhere else in the world (except New Zealand). It’s time to outlaw it in the United States once more. Pharma advertising accounts for at least half of CNN’s revenues, and they’ve already lost their main topic of propaganda – the fake Trump-Russia collusion.

Share this article on social media, or write your own letter to Trump about ending the CNN fake news reign. Imagine how many lives you could save and the mass suffering that could be ended by eliminating the ability of Big Pharma to brainwash the masses with poisonous drug propaganda. This is a peaceful way to destroy the insidious enemy and fight for liberty and natural medicine. The AMA almost banned all TV pharma ads two years ago, but then they backed off. Let’s help make it a reality soon! don’t forget to turn off the pharma-funded TV and burn the leftist-scripted newspapers.

Don’t forget to turn off the pharma-funded TV and burn the leftist-scripted newspapers.

(Natural News) While frying is considered a generally unsafe way to prepare food, a number of studies have demonstrated that frying can be healthy, as long as you use olive oil to do it. According to Rachel Adams, senior lecturer at Cardiff Metropolitan University in the United Kingdom, cooking with high heat triggers changes in oils that alter their aroma, flavor, and nutrient content, and that overheating cooking oils cause the release of toxic chemicals that are associated with the risks of diabetes and cancer. However, Adams maintained that the high antioxidant levels in olive oil may reduce the concentration of harmful chemicals produced during cooking. Using high-quality olive oil and keeping it below its smoking point may lessen the potential harm.

Australian Nutritional Medicine practitioner Fiona Tuck expressed a similar opinion on olive oil use. The health expert also stressed that consumers should consider the type of oil to use in cooking. Olive oil is “high in polyphenols which are antioxidants. Most health experts would agree the healthiest diet in the world is the Mediterranean diet which is rich in olive oil. It’s actually a very healthy oil to use, it’s the healthiest of oils, especially virgin olive oil which is less processed. It’s cold pressed which means it retains all of its nutrients. The more processed an oil is means it can potentially lose its nutrients,” Ms. Tuck wrote in an article on the Daily Mail.

Studies examine the safety of cooking with olive oil

Previous studies have indicated that using vegetable oils in frying could otherwise be detrimental to one’s health, largely due in part to the release of toxic chemicals called aldehydes when the oils reach their smoking point during high heat cooking. While aldehydes are naturally-occurring compounds, past research revealed that aldehyde accumulation in the body may lead to adverse health conditions including cancer and diabetes.

In an effort to determine the amount of aldehydes produced during frying, a team of researchers at the University of the Basque Country analyzed olive, sunflower, and flaxseed oils that were heated to 190 degrees Celsius. The researchers found that exposing both sunflower and flaxseed oils to high heat produced more aldehydes at a faster rate. However, olive oil was found to produce fewer aldehydes at a much slower pace. According to the experts, this may be because of structural differences between the oils. They also noted that the polyunsaturated sunflower and flaxseed oils may contain more regions that are susceptible to chemical reaction. (Related: Study demonstrates why olive oil is the best oil for frying)

Another study showed that frying fish in extra virgin olive oil resulted in higher amounts of Omega-3, Omega-1 acyl groups, linoleic acid, and saturated fat. “The choice of cooking oil is hugely important owing to its impact on the lipid profile in the fish and on the possible generation of toxic compounds in the oil during frying, which can influence food safety and human health. This study shows that the frying technique, the type of oil used, and the fish species exert a great influence on the changes that take place during the frying process,” said researcher Bárbara Nieva-Echevarría.

In addition, experiments carried out for BBC’s Trust Me I’m a Doctor showed that heating olive oil, butter and goose fat produced relatively low aldehyde levels, suggesting that using olive oil might be a better option in frying.

(Natural News) All those lies about little green cyber Russians invading black voting boxes to sabotage the U.S. presidential election has had one crack exposed, according to Breitbart, who reports that the Associated Press (AP) has written a retraction concerning those 17 agencies who supposedly agreed that pesky Putin and friends had been busy usurping America. The AP printed this falsehood four times: April 6, June 2, June 26 and June 29.

The AP, in its mea culpa issued June 30, 2017, states that the intelligence assessment was made after the three agencies — “the FBI, CIA and National Security Agency . . . and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence [DNI]” gathered the data. The DNI, says AP, “represents all U.S. intelligence agencies” and it was the DNI that published the information. The AP makes it clear in the retraction that “not all 17 agencies were involved in reaching the assessment.”

It’s comforting to know there was some dissent in the ranks. The news agency avoided using descriptive phrases like “deep state” and “rogue elements,” but that’s not in their vocabulary. This same false assessment was used by Mrs. Clinton in a testy exchange during the third presidential debate.

While these assessments were being crafted, the folks in charge of these three agencies included James Comey, the former and fired director of the FBI, John Brennan, an Obama appointee who ran the NSA and James Clapper, who holds the distinction of having been the fourth Director of National Intelligence. All these characters have colorful and obviously checkered pasts, but Mr. Clapper’s penchant for lying was made more obvious when he testified in front of Congress in 2013, saying that the NSA did not collect data on all Americans, well maybe “inadvertently,” but certainly not “wittingly.” Is it just a nervous tic to scratch one’s head and peer downward while speaking to a member of Congress?

As reported by Libertarian Institute, here is the transcript of that infamous exchange which is a stark example of perjury:

“Wyden: Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?

Clapper: No sir.

Wyden: It does not?

Clapper: Not wittingly. There are cases where they could, inadvertently perhaps, collect—but not wittingly.”

The security apparatus has been in place for a few decades. After September 11, 2001 the deep state’s vicious intent on destroying America was magnified a thousand fold and our current illegal and ubiquitous security system was built. It’s been growing ever since, as have the anxiety levels of many Americans. The DNI didn’t even exist before September 11, 2001. The FBI and the NSA did not openly share their information until after 9/11. Edward Snowden risked all he had to make the American people wake up to the electronic surveillance gates surrounding them shortly after James Clapper lied to Senator Wyden.

It turns out that the AP isn’t the only periodical that has retracted at least one portion of an intelligence assessment that many American believe is completely bogus. The disheveled New York Times issued its correction on June 29, 2017. Oh for the day when the sheeple will wake up and all the liars will be revealed.

(Natural News) The collapse of low-skilled labor in America continues unabated, thanks in large part to the advancement of robotics, and with it, a wave of coming unrest like nations have not seen in a long, long time.

As reported by CNBC, the fast-food industry, in particular, is poised for dramatic changes, with the introduction of electronic kiosks and robotic food preparation that one expert has projected will obliterate human workers in the industry by the mid-2020s.

The financial news site noted:

Grilling burgers may be fun on the Fourth of July, but less so if hot grease is your daily grind.

Enter Miso Robotics. The southern California start-up has built a robotic “kitchen assistant” called Flippy to do the hot, greasy and repetitive work of a fry cook. Flippy employs machine learning and computer vision to identify patties on a grill, track them as they cook, flip and then place them on a bun when they’re done.

Flippy is just one of the latest developments in the push to fully automate preparation in the fast food industry. Miso joins Zume Pizza, Makr Shakr, Frobot, Cafe X and Sally, all of which are developing robotics to assist franchise owners in the production of lattes, frozen yogurt, pizza, salads — and burgers.

In a recent interview with CNBC, Greg Creed, CEO of Yum Brands, said he believes that robots are going to replace most, if not all, fast food workers by the mid-2020s.

Oddly, the network doesn’t see that as a big deal, reporting that most fast food workers are not in love with their jobs, as evidenced by the high turnover rate (73 percent in 2016, says the Bureau of Labor Statistics). Fry cooks — the actual human burger-flippers — move on the quickest, according to government data.

That said, these jobs were never meant to become careers, at least not at the entry level. Over the years they became first-time employment for millions of young Americans, teaching them the responsibilities of holding down a real job as part of ‘life training’ for when they got older and began their careers.

But for some Americans, these jobs also served as full-time or additional part-time employment; what are they going to do when these jobs disappear, which seems evident with the rapid development and deployment of robotics?

Flippy, by Miso, is being designed to do just that: Replace all human food preparation at the grill.

For now, said CEO David Zito, it is being developed to work alongside humans.

“We take into account all of our customers’ needs for everything from food safety to maximum uptime,” he told CNBC. “Today our software allows robots to work at a grill, doing some of the nasty and dangerous work that people don’t want to do all day. But these systems can be adapted so that robots can work, say, standing in front of a fryer or chopping onions. These are all areas of high turnover, especially for quick service restaurants.”

Granted, the high industry turn over is one of the reasons why automation appeals to franchise owners. It’s expensive and inconvenient to have to continually hire replacement employees, even though that is the nature of the industry.

However, the push for robotics to replace humans is also aimed at cutting losses and expenses due to additional human proclivities: Calling in sick, taking vacation days, theft, habitual tardiness, creating a hostile work environment for others, skirting regulatory compliance requirements, and so forth. (RELATED: It’s true: Whole Foods to fire humans and replace them with robots under new owner Jeff Bezos)

So what are the 2.3 million cooks and fast food workers supposed to do?

“Like the electronic spreadsheet did for accountants, this will cause the jobs to go elsewhere,” Rob Stewart, president of Acacia, which is assisting Miso in its start-up, said. “But there will be new hospitality and culinary jobs we have yet to imagine. And those will be jobs where people will get paid a higher wage, and where they’ll want to stay long-term.”

Frankly, we don’t know that. In fact, the push is to add more robotics to virtually every current form of labor. And if anything, developers will find new ways to use robots in the future, not humans.

There is a massive wave of robotics-caused human unemployment coming, and all of the social chaos that will bring. It will be difficult, if not impossible, for governments to manage.

(Natural News) If you suffer from migraines or know someone who does, you’ll be familiar with the particular brand of debilitating pain that sets this type of headache apart from ordinary headaches. It might even be so strong that you have no choice but to put your life on hold until it passes. You might think that nothing works to help abate this excruciating pain. It’s true that migraines can be difficult to treat, but are you sure you’ve tried everything?

One often-overlooked treatment for migraines has just been shown in a study to work even better than migraine drugs: Cannabinoids. A study found that pills that contain these chemicals can reduce migraine pain by as much as 43.5 percent. Not only did it alleviate migraines, but it also helped curb stomach aches and muscle pain.

The study looked at 79 people who regularly suffer from cluster headaches and migraines. Some participants were given oral doses of two cannabis compounds each day for three months. The first compound, THC, is known for creating the psychological effects of cannabis, while the second compound, cannabidiol (CBD) has several therapeutic benefits including its antioxidant ability. The pills contained 200mg of the THC-CBD drug.

Other participants were given 25mg of amitriptyline, which is an antidepressant that is routinely prescribed to migraine patients.

The researchers discovered that the THC-CBD drug reduced the quantity and severity of both migraines and cluster headache attacks better than the medication. However, when it comes to those with cluster headaches, the cannabinoids might only benefit those patients who have been getting migraines since childhood.

The results are very promising because the current treatment of amitriptyline leaves a lot to be desired. It might help some migraine sufferers, but weight gain and drowsiness are common side effects, making it an unrealistic choice for many people. Even more concerning, it has been linked to sudden death.

Growing body of evidence supporting effects of cannabis on migraines

Past research has shown that cannabis can help migraines thanks to its ability to target the cells

in the body that are responsible for controlling inflammation and relieving pain. A study that was published in the medical journal Pharmacotherapy discovered that marijuana treatment led to fewer and less frequent migraines, while 100 percent of the participants in a Care by Design survey noted dramatic drops in discomfort and pain following medical cannabis use.

A migraine is so much more than a really bad headache; it often involves severe and throbbing pain that strikes one or both sides of a person’s head for anywhere from four to 72 hours. The pain is often paired with symptoms like nausea, dizziness, sensitivity to light, numbness or tingling of the extremities or face, and even vomiting.

Cluster headaches, meanwhile, are short but quite painful headaches that strike suddenly, sometimes occurring a few times a day. The pain is usually confined to just one side of the head, typically around an eye.

Other natural ways to alleviate this common ailment

The Migraine Research Foundation says that migraines are the third most common illness in the world and the sixth most disabling one. Affecting 18 percent of American women, six percent of men and 10 percent of children, more than four million adults in our country suffer chronic daily migraines.

It is hoped that studies like this one will lead to safer migraine treatments. However, there are several other natural ways that help alleviate migraine pain that your can try. While the success of the various options often depends on the individual, some people have reported getting relief from massage therapy, acupuncture, tai chi, yoga, and biofeedback.

(Natural News) Every year, doctors, employers, schools, and health authorities recommend that children and adults get a flu shot. However, the influenza vaccine has been shown to be highly ineffective and toxic for humans. Over the past couple of years, the word has gone out and fewer than half of all Americans received the flu shot during the 2015-2016 season, reported the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Since an estimated three out of five Americans didn’t get their flu vaccination, the industry is on a mission to protect its cash cow by pushing new, painless vaccine patches on the people.

Playing on the fear of needles and the long wait times at the doctor’s office, the vaccine industry came up with a new, painless way to administer the flu shot in hopes that it will increase the number of vaccinated people – and their profits.

An influenza vaccine without a needle

Today, most vaccines are delivered by an injection into a muscle. New research, however, suggested that a patch could successfully replace the annual flu jab. As reported by scientists at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, the patch was found to be as effective as a flu shot and it was also preferred by the majority of the patients.

Furthermore, the researchers noted that the patch could be stored outside the fridge for a year, meaning it could easily be distributed to patients by mail to administer to themselves. The patch, which is about one inch in diameter, contains 100 tiny microneedles which pierce the top layer of the skin without causing any pain.

The biodegradable patch can be self-administered by placing it on the wrist for 20 minutes. Since the needles dissolve while they are in the skin there is no danger of passing on blood-borne diseases.

While this may sound like a great invention — less pain, no doctor’s visit, and biodegradable — let’s not forget that even though it comes in a different package, it is still the same, toxic thing.

The patch contains the same toxic compounds as the conventional flu shots

As reported by The Daily Mail Online, the patch administers the exact same toxic substances as the conventional flu jab. The researchers tested the patch on 100 volunteers who did not receive the flu vaccine prior to using the patch.

They noted that after six months nobody got the flu and no serious side effects linked to the vaccine were reported. But what about the long-term effects on the brain of developing children? Although the industry and health authorities keep claiming that the annual flu vaccine is safe, why is it that the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP) must update the number of reported vaccine-injury cases every month?

Nonetheless, the government and the CDC push for all citizens, including infants, pregnant women, and seniors, to be injected with neurotoxic, health-damaging chemicals like mercury (listed as thimerosal), aluminum, formaldehyde, genetically modified bacteria, combined virus strains, and sodium chloride.

As noted by Mike Adams, the Health Ranger and Founder of Natural News, “flu shots are the greatest medical fraud in history.” For years, he has been on a mission to inform and protect the people and prevent vaccine injuries to save lives.

For more information about the barbaric, outmoded manufacturing technology of vaccines and how the industry has been granted absolute legal immunity from harm caused by vaccines, listen to Mike’s one-hour audio presentation below where he calls for an improved technology to make vaccines safer.

(Natural News) Perhaps nothing can be more debilitating than incontinence. This condition where the pelvic muscles are too weak, which makes retaining fluids difficult, affects approximately 13 million Americans. It’s an extremely embarrassing situation, forcing sufferers to just stay at home. There is a ray of hope, however, for incontinent patients. A recent study conducted at the China Academy of Chinese Medical Services just found out that acupuncture could hold the key to treating the condition.

Researchers worked with 504 women who are suffering from stress incontinence and subjected them to a series of electroacupuncture sessions over a period of six weeks. The participants were given 18 sessions while another group was subjected to dummy needles. Results showed that those who received electroacupuncture showed a decrease in urine leakage for six months after the treatment. Women in the real test group experienced an average of one less episode every 72 hours after the end of the course. Six months later, these women reported that they further experienced reduction in their episodes.

Incontinence affects the urinary system. This happens when any part of the system malfunctions. There are several types of incontinence: stress, urge, mixed, overflow, and reflex incontinence. In some cases, incontinence from surgery can occur. Of the estimated 13 million Americans affected by the condition, 85 percent are women. The condition is also more common among the elderly. Half (or even more) of elderly people living at home or in long-term care facilities are incontinent. Aside from the obvious physical discomfort, it also causes emotional distress. Who wouldn’t? Incontinence puts you at risk of humiliation, which often leads to loss of self-esteem.

Women are more likely to be affected because of childbirth. In some cases, obesity is another fact, which can exacerbate the problem.

Dr. Baoyan Liu, lead author of the study, said that electroacupuncture was just as good as pelvic floor training and that it took only half the time. “Electroacupuncture was effective with rapid response, short treatment period and good compliance.”

Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese technique that stimulates specific points in the body by inserting thin needles through the skin. Studies have shown that this may help ease several types of pain like chronic back pain, neck pain, and osteoarthritis/knee pain. Acupuncture may also minimize the frequency of tension headaches and prevent migraine headaches. This is the most probable option for people suffering from chronic pain.

Interestingly, however, clinical practice guidelines are inconsistent so it’s quite challenging to recommend acupuncture. Studies on the effects of acupuncture on the mind and body are only beginning to be understood. Current findings suggest that some factors responsible for the beneficial effects of the practice — expectation and belief — may not be directly related to acupuncture.

Then there’s the question of the side effects of acupuncture. According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health there are relatively few complications from using acupuncture that have been reported. If any, the complications were a result of using non-sterile needles and improper delivery of treatments, which can lead to serious adverse effects, like infections, collapsed lungs, punctured organs, and injury to the central nervous system.

Despite not having very concrete scientific proof about acupuncture’s effects on incontinence, the results obtained by Dr. Liu and his team are notable. The fact that they were able to successfully help a group of women improve their condition says a lot about the proven health benefits of this traditional Chinese treatment.

Although it takes around three months for patients to see and feel the results of electroacupuncture, this still provides a quicker and more effective way to keep women (and some men) to stop being afraid of getting out of the house.

(Natural News) The over-used antibacterial chemicals in soaps, toothpaste, and everyday household items aren’t stopping harmful bacteria as advertised. These synthetic bactericides are causing harmful bacteria to mutate and develop resistant traits, making them more infectious, claims a new report.

Antibacterial soaps containing triclosan, triclocarban, and 19 other bactericides are useless for killing germs because these chemicals cause infectious bacteria to take on new traits so they can survive and dominate their environment. On top of all this, experts warn that these chemicals are disrupting the hormones of pregnant women and are harming babies at crucial development stages.

A report authored by 200 different scientists has claimed that these antibacterial chemicals are doing “more harm than good.” The modern day obsession with “killing bacteria” is creating hostile environments that suppress the natural environment of friendly bacteria. These antibacterial chemicals are essentially weaponizing bacteria against humans, encouraging the spread of infectious disease into the already deteriorated, undernourished cellular environments of humans.

Triclosan and antibacterial chemicals cause severe hormone disruption

Experts, such as the FDA’s Director of the Center for Evaluation and Research, now recommend just plain soap and hot water for cleaning up. Chemicals such as triclosan alter hormone activity in the body, which negatively impacts a child’s development, a women’s menstrual cycle, or a mom’s ability to produce quality breast milk. Rolf Halden, professor of engineering at Arizona State University, said: “Environmental and human exposures to triclosan and triclocarban are widespread, affecting pregnant women, developing fetuses, and breast-feeding babies.” Hormone disruption can lead to birth defects, miscarriage, and cancer. When triclosan degrades in the presence of UV radiation and chlorine water, it forms toxic dioxin compounds that persist in the water supply, which are linked to birth defects and cancer.

Dr. Barbara Sattler, environmental health professor at the University of San Francisco, said: “People think antimicrobial hand soaps offer better protection against illness, but generally, antimicrobial soaps perform no better than plain soap and water.” Dr. Janet Woodcock of the FDA says that these antibacterial ingredients are doing more harm over the long term. These antibacterial chemicals act on bacteria in similar ways as antibiotics, exciting resistant traits that are hard to treat.

The US banned triclosan from soap in 2016, but substitute chemicals are expected to pose similar problems. “I was happy that the FDA finally acted to remove these chemicals from soaps,” said Dr. Arlene Blum, executive director of the Green Science Policy Institute. “But I was dismayed to discover at my local drugstore that most products now contain substitutes that may be worse,” she continued. It doesn’t help that these chemicals are pervasive and found in all sorts of products, including food storage containers, school supplies, paints, exercise mats, electronics, kitchenware, flooring, clothes, home textiles, and countertops.

Methods of prevention that don’t readily cause bacterial resistance include essential oils, raw honey, and silver

Natural antimicrobial compounds that are a part of plant’s makeup, are designed to coexist with bacteria in the environment. These natural compounds are more effective at holding harmful bacteria accountable because these compounds do not typically destroy friendly microbe activity. Instead, these natural compounds evolve alongside bacteria to protect the plants and retain balance in nature. If they are used wisely, natural antimicrobial compounds from plants are more effective for restoring the balance of microbial environments, allowing human cells the ability to adapt in the face of evolving pathogens.

This is why essential oils from plants are gaining popularity for helping people prevent and heal from infections. Similarly, raw honey, containing multiple antimicrobial properties from plants, is effective for restoring depleted cellular environments. Other antimicrobial actions are found in the element silver. The natural properties of a silver atom consistently break down harmful bacteria because a silver atom readily binds to bacteria cells and absorbs through their cell wall. Silver is designed in a way to kill harmful bacteria because it disrupts the bacteria cell’s metabolic functions without harming human cells.

Public health will improve only if individuals and the health care system get back to basics and integrate more natural medicines into practice. (RELATED: For more on natural healing, visit Healing.News)

(Natural News) Chocolates and kids don’t really match, at least according to their parents or nannies who just want to have a peaceful night. You’ve probably seen kids get too hyper after eating a bar of chocolate and thought they’re not exactly a good combination. But, a new study published in Frontiers in Nutrition by Italian researchers has shed light on one of the many benefits of chocolates: it can boost brain performance.

That’s one more reason to stock up on cocoa and those dark chocolate bars. The research discovered that nutrients present in cocoa — flavanols — show very strong potential in improving brain performance. Flavanols are promising when it comes to boosting memory and cognition.

Flavonols are one of the many groups of phytochemicals that protect the health by fighting inflammation and neutralizing free radicals. There are more than 8,000 phytochemicals and one of the biggest groups, called flavonoids, is so huge they’re further categorized into different groups. Flavonols are one of them. Flavonols are the most abundant flavonoids present in foods and they have strong antioxidant properties.

Studies have shown that flavonoids have positive effects on the brain. They can protect neurons against injury, suppress neuroinflammation, and promote memory, learning and cognitive function. Based on the findings, consumption of flavonoid-rich foods, like cocoa, has the potential to limit neurodegeneration and prevent (or reverse) age-related cognitive problems.

Although there were some mixed results from a number of previous studies on the same subject, the researchers were able to conclude that flavonols from cocoa, when consumed in large amounts, can benefit the brain and memory. As expected, the quantity of flavonols and the amount of testing played vital roles in the study. Researchers found that the subjects displayed more positive results after completing difficult and rigorous memory testing.

Interestingly, the brain benefits of cocoa were more prominent in older people. In fact, cocoa drinks that had high levels of flavonoids helped adults who were experiencing memory problems. They also showed an improvement in verbal fluency tasks. Daily intake significantly improved brain function for the elderly. These people improved in attention, working memory, and processing speed.

However, the study found that these improvements were more pronounced in people who have already experienced memory decline or had mild cognitive impairments. According to neuroscientists professor Michele Ferrara and Ph.D. student Valentia Socci, this was the most “unexpected and promising” result.

“This result suggests the potential of cocoa flavonols to protect cognition in vulnerable populations over time by improving cognitive performance,” she said.

Eating chocolates can affect the body is several ways. First, it can lead to a small reduction in blood pressure, improve memory, aid digestion, strengthen the heart, and suppress your appetite. Cocoa contains phenylethylamine, which possesses aphrodisiac-like properties. Aside from that, chocolates contain serotonin and endorphins in the brain to give you a temporary high. It also facilitate digestion and has been proven to have a natural calming effect. Contrary to popular belief, chocolates — the right kind — can aid in weight loss because of the appetite-suppressing properties it possesses. These will help you feel fuller longer so you don’t overeat. Consequently, these can protect you from obesity and prevent type-2 diabetes in the long run.

Flavonols are generally good for overall health. They are good for the cardiovascular health. “It you look at the underlying mechanism, the cocoa flavonols have beneficial effects for cardiovascular health and can increase cerebral blood volume in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Regular intake of cocoa and chocolate could indeed provide beneficial effects on cognitive functioning over time,” Professor Ferrara said.

But it’s important to know that there are still potential side effects, especially if you’re not doing it right. Consume chocolates in moderation and, if you can, opt for the dark varieties for maximum health benefits.

(Natural News) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has revealed its latest project in hopes of sparing the planet and protecting the human race from a potentially devastating asteroid impact.

The initiative, called Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART), is a refrigerator-sized aircraft designed to deliberately crash into a smaller component of the Didymos asteroid, a binary asteroid system slated to make a distant approach to Earth in October 2022, and then again in 2024. The asteroid system has been on NASA’s radar and was closely monitored since 2003. It is made up of two bodies: Didymos A that measures about half a mile in size, and Didymos B, which measures around 530 feet.

The calculated crash is expected to generate an impact of approximately 3.7 miles per second — or about about nine times faster than the speed of a bullet — in order to alter the asteroid system’s course. The space agency’s DART project is slated to impact only Didymos B, whose composition remains unclear. However, its size is typical of asteroids, which means that Didymos B has enough potential to trigger regional effects upon its impact to the planet.

“DART would be NASA’s first mission to demonstrate what’s known as the kinetic impactor technique — striking the asteroid to shift its orbit — to defend against a potential future asteroid impact. This approval step advances the project toward an historic test with a non-threatening small asteroid,” Lindley Johnson, NASA’s planetary defense officer in Washington, was quoted as saying in TheSun.co.uk.

According to DART program scientist Tom Statler, the binary asteroid system was the perfect natural setting to test the spacecraft. Statler said it would be easier to determine the results of the impact as Didymos B is readily in orbit around Didymos A. This also ensures that DART will not alter the orbit of the pair of asteroid systems. DART’s double asteroid redirection test is set to take place in 2022.

DART’s kinetic impact technique could make a difference

According to NASA, the kinetic impactor technique works by altering the speed of a threatening asteroid by a small fraction of its total velocity. Slight changes in the asteroid’s velocity can result to its total veering away from its natural course, which is towards our planet. (Related: It’s only a matter of time before an asteroid crash wipes out humanity)

This effect can allow our observatories to assess the impact and the resulting change in the orbit of Didymos B around Didymos A. As a result, this can help scientists determine the efficacy of kinetic impact as a potential asteroid mitigation scheme.

“DART is a critical step in demonstrating [that] we can protect our planet from a future asteroid impact. Since we don’t know that much about [its] internal structure or composition, we need to perform this experiment on a real asteroid. With DART, we can show how to protect Earth from an asteroid strike with a kinetic impactor by knocking the hazardous object [onto] a different flight path that would not threaten the planet,” Andy Cheng, DART’s co-lead investigator told DailyMail.co.uk.

(Natural News) Yoga has been used as a form of therapy to help people with various physical, emotional, and mental conditions. More and more studies are showing how this ancient practice benefits the body and mind. Given its powerful healing effects, yoga is being introduced into various integrative centers as an alternative therapy to modern medicine and psychotherapy.

“Yoga teaches us to cure what need not be endured and endure what cannot be cured,” BKS Iyengar once said.

Though this thousand-year-old Indian discipline has been shown to boost physical and mental wellbeing, the fake media is on a mission to put this natural way of healing in a bad spotlight. Just as they keep claiming mercury in vaccines is “safe,” the mainstream media has now jumped on the recent absurd news that yoga classes are causing more harm than good.

Yoga more dangerous than previously thought — yeah right!

The ridiculous statement finds its origin in a research paper which was recently published in the Journal of Bodywork and Movement Therapies. Researchers at the University of Sydney, Australia, reported that yoga caused musculoskeletal pain in more than 10 percent of the participants while exacerbating more than one-fifth of their existing injuries.

“Our study found that the incidence of pain caused by yoga is more than 10 per cent per year, which is comparable to the injury rate of all sports injuries combined among the physically active population,” lead researcher Associate Professor Evangelos Pappas told the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).

For their study, the researchers assessed more than 350 people — mostly women with an average age of 45 — who attended classes at two yoga studios in New York. They were asked to complete a questionnaire at the beginning of the study and again after one year.

Professor Evangelos Pappas, who is a yoga teacher himself, explained that the upper limbs are not designed to support a lot of weight. Hence, the 13.3 percent increase in pain in the shoulders, elbows, wrists or hands.

Since yoga has gained so much popularity in the past decade, the mainstream media jumped on this news, claiming yoga to be more dangerous than previously thought. What these headlines forget to mention, however, is that Professor Pappas and his team also found that for nearly two-thirds of participants, or 74 percent, yoga improved pain in the lower back and neck. Furthermore, yoga has shown significant beneficial effects in treating other mild injuries and depression.

The downward dog not more dangerous than any other form of exercise

However, just as with any other type of exercise, yoga can lead to pain and injuries. This can be due to malpractice or trying to do too much too fast. Therefore, Professor Pappas noted that given yoga’s popularity and perceived safety, it’s important that participants treat it like any other form of exercise.

Furthermore, he stressed the importance of discussing preexisting conditions and pain with your yoga teacher or physiotherapist to explore posture modifications in order to make sure you don’t make things worse.

Yoga’s gentle stretches can strengthen and protect muscles and help people recover from pain. Nonetheless, some poses can be dangerous too. Yoga shouldn’t hurt and it isn’t a competition either. We all have our limitations. As cool as that scorpion pose or handstand may look, they are not for everybody. Be mindful when practicing yoga. Don’t force yourself into positions your body can’t handle. Avoid injury and reap the healing benefits yoga can have on your body and mind by starting slow and listening to your what your body tells you.

(Natural News) More signs of an impending mass retail collapse are emerging, this time in Canada. According to new reports, struggling department store giant Sears is planning to close 60 stores throughout Canada, eliminating nearly 3,000 jobs in the process and setting the company on a track towards bankruptcy.

Sears Canada announced in a press release that it recently filed for creditor protection under Canadian law. While the company plans to massively downsize and restructure itself, with hopes to eventually reemerge under a new corporate model, it has a lot of debt to deal with first.

Part of the company’s restructuring plan involves seeking $340.1 million ($450 million in Canadian dollars) from its term loan and asset-backed loan lenders for debtor-in-possession financing. Wells Fargo Capital Finance Corporation and GACP Finance Co., LLC will together act as administrative agents in helping Sears to reach this goal.

In the meantime, 20 full-line Sears stores, 15 Sears Home stores, 10 Sears Outlet stores, and 14 Sears Hometown stores will all be closing their doors. Thousands of employees at these stores will obviously lose their jobs, as will many employees who work at the company’s Canadian headquarters in Toronto.

“After five years of operating losses and negative cash flow, the Canadian retailer said in a June 13 release that ‘cash and forecasted cash flows from operations are not expected to be sufficient to meet obligations coming due over the next 12 months,'” writes Ben Unglesbee for RetailDive.com.

“Prompting the statement were negotiations with lenders for a liquidity injection that fell short of the retailer’s needs.”

Sears Canada parts ways with U.S. parent, embarks on ‘reinvention plan’ that’s already showing signs of success

Despite all this, Sears isn’t going down without a fight – at least not in Canada. After parting with its U.S. parent, Sears Canada has already begun implementing its “reinvention plan” to jumpstart sales and get things back up and running from a profit perspective. The company announced just days ago that virtually every element of its business is being completely revamped. “Sears Canada rebuilt its front and back-end technology platform, redefined its brand positioning, revamped its product assortment, and rebooted its customer experience and service standards,” the announcement reads.

This new approach was also reported on by Newswire Canada. “The new product assortment is reflected in two pillars, The Cut @ Sears, which offers designer labels at everyday value prices, and the Sears Label, which offers premium quality and enduring styles, also at everyday value prices.”

“The customer experience was reinvented, both online, with a newly designed site built in-house by a new technology team, and in-store with a new format called Sears 2.0. Sears Canada also redefined its customer service standards to be best-in-class, and launched a new store in downtown Toronto to showcase its reinvention to an entirely new audience,” the site continued.

These initial changes are already showing success, as the company announced reported growth in these same-store sales during the last two completed quarters. But will it all be enough to keep the company afloat in the longer term? Time will tell, as retail brick and mortar in general is having a tough time these days weathering the storm against not only online retail giants like Amazon, but also aggressive physical store retailers like Walmart.

At least in Canada, Walmart’s presence was enough to drive out major competitor Target, which only two years after opening its first Canadian store ended up shutting it down, along with the 132 others it opened in the years following. Target no longer does business in Canada, and reports indicate that it’s now having financial troubles in the U.S. as well that are prompting it to sell off its assets left and right.

How much do you really know about the bacterial balance of your intestinal system? How much do you respect your gut flora balance? Could ignoring this knowledge be the MAIN reason you can't digest food properly? Yes, it could.

MD's know little of this so don't ask them; you'll have to consult a Naturopath. Or maybe you could study Natural Health News reports and compiled research and come to your own conclusions. This is a thought.

The ideal ratio for gut bacteria is 85 percent good to 15 percent bad, just for starters. Let's talk about the good guys and their job absorbing starches, fiber and sugars.

What else is thrown in the mix ... dead food or pesticide food (GMO)? Maybe you're putting all the liver's responsibilities on your pancreas, by overwhelming it with toxins.

Deficiencies in magnesium and enzymes might top the list of considerations here.

If you're stressed out, you may have depleted your vitamins and minerals entirely. Do you work out often and vigorously? There are FIVE digestion "destroyers" you can simply eliminate from your daily food regimen, and thus detoxify in a number of ways, treating a number of cleansing organs.

Vitamin D makes many conventional drugs and treatments obsolete. Very few people know this or find proper organic Vitamin D levels their body wants and needs. You CAN actually increase your life span with Vitamin D.

Plenty of people who eat organic food their whole lives live well past 100 years young, and they still have their minds and bodies fully functional, not ridden with cancer or Alzheimer's - which are both preventable diseases.

Letting the truth reach the masses is the goal here. Some people are actually afraid of supplementing because certain MDs will scare them off of nutrition as medicine. This is sickening and ridiculous, but AMA enforced for nearly 100 years now.

You want to be organic? Give your body what it's begging you for - proper quality vitamin D, and not the cheap, dead stuff. Now that's great "medical" coverage!

(NaturalNews) As the Executive Director of the Consumer Wellness Center ( www.ConsumerWellness.org ), I'm thrilled to announce the 2014 grant recipients who received grant funding from the CWC to promote food self-reliance and nutrition programs all around the world.As Natural News readers know, the CWC is a non-profit 501(c)3 organization that works to empower consumers with information on wellness, disease prevention, nutrition, peak mental and physical health and more. The 2014 grant program is named the "Holly Moran Grant" in honor of this remarkable woman who brought tremendous light to the world and was one of the key coordinators of the grant program.The Consumer Wellness Center spendsand spends zero dollars on salaries. My own position at the CWC as Executive Director is a non-paid position. If you wish to donate to the CWC to help support future grants, you may donate at this page . You can read about myself, the Health Ranger, at www.HealthRanger.com In applying for the grant, each applicant was asked to describe their plan for using the grant funds to help promote food gardening, nutritional awareness or food self-reliance.All applicants were asked to commit to sharing a report of how the grant funding is impacting the lives of program participants (children, expectant mothers, senior citizens, and so on).Here's a brief description of the 2014 Holly Moran Grant recipients and how they plan to use the grant funding:Seedleaf's mission is to increase knowledge of food for families at risk of hunger, and the organization's efforts have resulted in the creation of 14 area community gardens.These gardens provide sources of hands-on education for local youth and adults to increase their access to healthy, fresh fruits and vegetables.With the grant money, Seedleaf plans to host Cooking Clubs that will empower the youth with cooking and gardening skills while encouraging self-reliance, healthy food choices, physical activity, and caring for the natural environment.GROWING UP is an after school program series designed to teach students aged 14-18 Culinary Arts using fresh vegetables, fruit and herbs from the George Wythe Edible School Garden and surrounding urban farms and community gardens.The group will be creating a cookbook from the meal ideas with the hopes of raising money in support of future classes.Roosevelt Elementary school will be using the grant money to build 8 garden boxes. Each grade level will be responsible for their own garden box.The school will also provide nutrition classes to teach the students about the produce they are growing. Students will experience cooking classes that teach them how to make meals with their garden goods while embracing the importance of organic vs. non-organic gardens.These two schools are teaming together to begin maintaining an apple orchard on property that was previously abandoned. Their goal is to get an orchard functioning, with healthy growth and production, and to involve students in the entire growth and harvesting process.Plans call for the orchard to help teach students the value of food self-reliance, benefits of physical effort in food production and to even help produce a modest income through the sales of apples.The Catholic Charities' "Our Place Program" in New Hampshire specializes in prenatal and parenting education. Their focus is to empower high-risk, low-income, new or expecting young mothers with the knowledge, skills and confidence to select and prepare nutritious and affordable meals for themselves and their children.Their ultimate goal is to improve nutrition practices, eating habits and food budgeting skills among these young woman. They will use the CWC grant funds to help support these educational programs that impact women.MaituFoods offers thewhich offers a 2-day hands-on enrichment course in proper nutrition during pregnancy, home health garden techniques, and children's nutrition.Through this program, they teach meal options and shopping strategies for items that promote health and well being. They work with midwives and nutrition specialists to develop meal plans for their families and receive hands-on experience with gardening and meal preparation.The Fitness and Nutrition Club will be using the grant to facilitate the connection between school and home by organizing free cooking classes and cooking demonstrations for FAN Club students and their families.They hope to collaborate on finding healthy alternatives to common foods consumed at home and establish healthier eating habits for their students and their families.The SBYO will be funding a monthly childrens' and parents' nutrition program designed to improve the nutritive quality of foods consumed at home as a whole.They plan to assess the health of all participants prior to and after the program, with the hopes of evaluating the nutritive quality of current diets of Somali Bantu students while identifying positive changes from program participation.The YMCA plans to use their vacant land adjacent to the club to introduce students to the experience of gardening, motivate kids to eat and love fruits and vegetables, promote physical activity, and teach students to nurture and care for other living things. In addition they hope to teach responsibility, patience, team work and social skills.These Youth Centers are teaming up with theto organize field trips to local farmers' markets to meet with farmers, brainstorm on what they would like to grow and create gardens for the students to maintain.Grant funds will also be used to work with a nutritionist to create healthy and exciting meals with the items acquired from the farmers' markets.Pine Village, a continuing care retirement facility (CCRC), is actively educating their staff and residents on the essentials of home grown food. Last year they began planting gardening boxes and raising chickens. Their residents enjoyed meals from the gardens while getting back to their roots and farming again, like many of them did in their younger years.Their hope is to extend the gardens, adopt more chickens and start cooking classes for many of the staff (who are predominately young women).In addition to these Holly Moran grant awards in 2014, the Consumer Wellness Center will be making a significant number of donations in the form of breakthrough food production technology being announced in 2015 at www.FoodRising.org Watch for more announcements here on Natural News concerning food self-reliance, innovative food production inventions and much more... 2015 is going to be a very exciting year at the Consumer Wellness Center and Natural News!Learn more about the Consumer Wellness Center at www.ConsumerWellness.org

Oooh, let's talk about the lies the food industry tells us! They brainwash us with commercials of food that looks good. They repeat what to eat over and over and over again, until it sinks in our brains.

But what if YOU are consuming pesticide DAILY, because the kind of pesticide lurking in genetically modified food (GMO) can never be washed off, and your body may not be able to dispose of it either.

That would mean your cells are mutating because they are trying to interpret the nutrition in the food and it's just NOT there.

The misinterpretation of things that taste sweet or salty tricks your body into ingesting bug killer and weed killer genes, and your gut is CREATING pesticide. Did you not know?

Why do you think the people who are so adamant about banning GMO are so dogmatic when they speak about it? They know. They don't want cancer. Listen to them.

You can't wash off GMO, so you better buy organic fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds.

Preppers in California get a rare self-defense victory: Federal judge blocks state ban on high-capacity magazines

Well, what do you know: Miracles do happen for freedom-loving Americans who try to do what they can to remain as prepared as possible in this chaotic and uncertain world, even those in the socialist republic of California.

Last week a federal judge issued an injunction against a voter-approved measure that would have required anyone who owned a rifle magazine with greater than a 10-round capacity to surrender them to authorities.

As reported by the Sacramento Bee, U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez, in San Diego, issued the injunction after finding that the law most likely was unconstitutional because it would disallow use of firearms that employed “whatever common magazine size he or she judges best suits the situation.”

In other words, it appears as though the law is an “infringement” on a person’s “right to keep and bear arms” as recognized and guaranteed by the Second Amendment.

Under provisions of the law, all magazines larger than 10 rounds would be banned.

“The State of California’s desire to criminalize simple possession of a firearm magazine able to hold more than 10 rounds is precisely the type of policy choice that the Constitution takes off the table,” the injunction read.

The judge also noted that “a final decision will take too long to offer relief, and because the statute will soon visit irrevocable harm on Plaintiffs and all those similarly situated a state-wide preliminary injunction is necessary and justified to maintain the status quo.”

In so ruling, Benitez granted the requests of attorneys who represented the California Rifle & Pistol Association who sought to block implementation of the law. The group is aligned with the National Rifle Association.

The Sacramento Bee noted:

In the days leading up to the ban, some California gun owners, pro-gun sheriffs and sellers have been reluctant to give up their magazines. Some gun owners have previously said that they were hoping pending court challenges would block the ban.

“We’re not going to be knocking on anybody’s door looking for them,” said Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko in an earlier interview with the paper. “We’re essentially making law-abiding citizens into criminals with this new law.”

Exactly right. And in addition to that, the state is seeking to dramatically limit the manner, mode and method in which people can choose to protect themselves, which is not one the Constitution reserves to state or federal elected officials (or even to voters, in the case of this magazine ban, as, the Constitution cannot be changed or subjugated by a vote of the people).

What’s worse is that state officials were justifying the ban on false premises. Attorney General Xavier Becerra said it was necessary to prevent new mass shootings, when the most recent mass shootings in the state were carried out by terrorists, not law-abiding gun owners.

Despite this temporary reprieve, which hopefully will stand, given that the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the Second Amendment as an individual right, California preppers looking to survive a future SHTF scenario still face hostility from most other people in their state; the magazine ban passed with a 63 percent majority.

That’s sad, because it also means that a majority of Californians have been successfully brainwashed into believing they should have no control or responsibility whatsoever for their own safety and survival, and that it’s only right to trust their lives to government. (RELATED: California wants all its citizens to be disarmed so that no one can resist the tyranny that’s coming when the state goes bankrupt)

Only, when the collapse does come, there won’t be enough “authorities” to protect them or most other people. The only ones who will stand a chance at all are those who possess the ability to provide for their own defense, using a firearm with a load capacity “he or she judges best suits the situation.”

For now, at least, Judge Benitez has made Californians who take personal responsibility for their own lives much safer.

Apocalypse insurance? Billionaires buying up land at staggering pace

Many billionaires amassed their fortunes by having a keen sense of foresight. A lot of hard work might have been involved, but knowing what to pursue, when and how helped them reach the pinnacle of success and avert disaster along the way. Now, that same remarkable acumen is leading many of the world’s top earners to buy up massive amounts of land across the country and even the world in a move that has survival written all over it.

Many of these wealthy individuals are snapping up property in states like Wyoming, New Mexico, North Dakota and Montana, where they are creating fortified shelters and stocking up on supplies like organic emergency survival food, tools and weapons.

In fact, LinkedIn Co-Founder Reid Hoffman told The New Yorker that he believes more than half of Silicon Valley billionaires have purchased some type of “apocalypse insurance” in the form of underground bunkers or properties, which could provide a safe place to wait out scenarios like nuclear wars, viral epidemics, civil unrest, or electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attacks.

Many of these billionaires also have private planes on standby that can depart the minute something bad goes down, and they have weapons, generators, and motorcycles on hand just in case. Like smart preppers, however, few of these well-known billionaires have admitted publicly that their land is being used for this purpose.

Reddit CEO and Co-Founder Steve Huffman recently spoke about the matter to The New Yorker. He said he underwent corrective laser eye surgery in the hopes of boosting his chances of surviving a disaster, when getting his hands on glasses or contacts would be a big challenge. He also said he has enough motorcycles, guns, ammo and food to last a long time.

A former Reddit CEO, Yishan Wong, also had eye surgery with survival scenarios in mind. He said: “Most people just assume improbable events don’t happen, but technical people tend to view risk very mathematically.

“The tech preppers do not necessarily think a collapse is likely. They consider it a remote event, but one with a very severe downside, so, given how much money they have, spending a fraction of their net worth to hedge against this… is a logical thing to do.”

Mayfield Fund Managing Director Tim Chang told the publication that many of his peers meet up to talk about their backup plans, stocking up on cryptocurrency, obtaining second passports, and buying vacation homes abroad that could serve as escape havens. He said that he had been buying a lot of real estate for generating passive income in addition to giving himself “havens” to which he and his family could escape.

Bunker business booming

Some enterprising companies are catering to this demand. For example, Trident Lakes in Texas is a luxury bunker that promises Defcon-1 levels of preparedness with a golf course, armed security guards, and helipads. Rising S Company, also in Texas, noted a year-on-year growth in custom luxury underground bunker sales of 700 percent in 2016. Their plate steel bunkers can withstand earthquakes and are built to last generations. Survival Condo is a firm that develops luxury condos capable of surviving nuclear attacks. Complete with a gym, pool, and library, these condos cost as much as $4 million apiece.

You might not have billions of dollars at your disposal, but there is still plenty that you can do to give yourself a fighting chance if things go south. It’s never too late to start planning for such scenarios, and as the current political and economic climates continue to head in concerning directions, it could mean the difference between life and death.

(Natural News) Stockpiling is a good way of storing food for future survival needs. However, pests remain among the biggest hurdles in stockpiling. According to Census Bureau‘s newly released American Housing Survey, 11 percent of U.S. households had encounters with rats or mice in 2015 alone, while 12 percent had reported encounters with cockroaches.

The survey also revealed that Houston was the most pest-infested city in the country, with eight percent of households reporting rat or mice encounters and 38 percent having cockroach encounters. Among the top 10 pest-infested cities in the country are Washington D.C., Atlanta, Philadelphia, Nashville, Phoenix, Boston, Miami, and Tampa. Aside from rats and roaches, moths and ants have also become a nuisance among households.

With these numbers at hand, it would be essential to know how to effectively thwart these pests and keep them away from stockpiles. This article will walk you through steps to protect your stockpile from these pests.

Ward off pests from your stockpile with these steps

Mice and rats – Because of their gnawing habit and their fast reproduction, mice and rats have continued to be among the most prominent pests that pose a threat to both your edible and non-edible stockpile. Below are a few steps to rid your stockpile of these pests:

Keep your stockpile area clean – Maintaining a clean stockpile and removing the smell of food and water may deter these rodents. Keeping the stockpile airtight and free of dust will do the trick. It may also be beneficial to avoid storing your things in damp or swampy storage places.

Visit the store room frequently – Making your presence known by moving bins around or disrupting the stockpile area may force rodents to vacate quickly. It is also advisable to always bring a metal rod when inspecting the area. Rats can quickly grow to the size of a small cat, so carrying something to bash them with might prove handy.

Use traps – Traps have always been the go-to option when it comes to eradicating rodents.

Keep a few cats – As a natural enemy of rodents, cats will keep them away from your stockpile. Cats may also go after other pests including squirrels, moles, and chipmunks.

Herb up your stockpile – Herbs such as peppermint and spearmint are known to be natural rodent-deterrents.

Cockroaches – Like mice and rats, cockroaches are notoriously fast breeders. Here a few steps to deter these creepy-crawlies from your stockpile:

Keep your storage area clean – Keeping the area clean is perhaps the most essential step to repel these insects. Discard infested materials that you find lying around and clean the area with soap and water. Always keep the area dry and free of food crumbs.

Use airtight containers – Transfer food items inside airtight bins to avoid infestation.

Take note of possible entries – Search the area for holes and crevices where insects may enter.

Make use of earth and flour mixtures to kill cockroaches – Combining equal amounts of diatomaceous earth and flour may help eliminate pests. Cockroaches are going to be attracted to your concoction because of the flour, and as they dig into your mixture, they simultaneously ingest diatomaceous earth that is toxic to them.

Ants – These insects, especially the sugar ant species, are particularly after sugar and other sweet food. You may eliminate these pests through these steps:

Keep your stockpile area clean – Make sure that the area is free of food debris, especially soda splashes or bread crumbs.

Seal entries – Due to their small size, ants can virtually travel anywhere. Seal cracks that may potentially become the way for ants to invade a room, causing an ant infestation.

Use natural remedies – Sprinkle strong-smelling spices like cinnamon or pepper inside your storage area to deter these insects. Using diatomaceous earth also appears to be effective in keeping the pests off.

Pantry moths – Pantry moths are known to infest flours and grains. Eliminate pantry moths with these helpful steps:

Keep your storage area clean – Clean your storage area frequently. You might want to vacuum the area also, just to be sure, to remove moth eggs and larvae that are not usually that noticeable.

Use airtight containers – Using durable and sealed containers such as cans and jars may help deter moth infestations.

Use traps – Pantry moths can also be deterred by using pheromone traps.

(Natural News) Raw milk is a delightful treat that is at the same time packed with vitamins and nutrients such as vitamins A, D, and K2 and minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium. However, in order for you to be able to enjoy it for longer than just a few days, you should be able to know how to store it properly. Generally, milk that is stored at optimal temperature should still last from seven to 10 days. Here are some tips to prolong the freshness of your raw milk.

Use organic raw milk – Organic raw milk lasts for a month, as compared with regular milk, that lasts only about a week or so. According to Pennsylvania State University professor of animal nutrition and physiology Craig Baumrucker, producers of organic raw milk subject their products to a different preservation system called ultra-high temperature (UHT) processing —in which milk is heated to 280 degrees Fahrenheit (138 degrees Celsius) for two to four seconds, eliminating any presence of bacteria in it — as compared with the standard preservation process called pasteurization, in which milk is heated to 145 degrees F (60 degrees C) for at least 30 minutes, or the more common process of heating the milk to 160 degrees (71 degrees C) for around 15 minutes. (Related: Milk industry claims cow’s milk results in weight loss; bad science meets dishonest marketing. )

Know the milking procedure – Freshly-sourced m ilk has a temperature of around 104 degrees F (40 degrees C). If a farm decides to bottle raw milk before it has the chance to cool down to 34 to 40 degrees F (one to four degrees C), the shelf-life of the milk is reduced by a week. When warm milk is immediately placed inside a bottle and then inside a refrigerator for cooling purposes, the warm milk does not get the chance to cool down naturally. Quite literally, it takes hours for the milk to cool. The longer that raw milk is above 40 degrees F (four degrees C), the faster the milk will sour.

Ensure that your refrigerator is cooling at the right temperature – A refrigerator used to store raw milk should have a temperature no higher than 40 degrees F (four degrees C). Check your fridge to ensure that it has the right temperature; otherwise you can be sure that a couple of days have been taken away from your milk’s shelf life. The ideal temperature is 33 to 36 degrees F.

Freeze raw milk with baking soda – T ry this trick: Instead of refrigerating and merely cooling the milk you purchased, freeze it. Freezing raw milk ensures its freshness and locks it in. A problem when it comes to freezing raw milk is finding that the cream is a bit grainy after thawing. Remedy this issue by adding at least half a teaspoon of baking soda to your raw milk before freezing it.

(Natural News) At the dawn of the nuclear age, the United States government began developing plans that would ensure its survival should the unthinkable happen and a nuclear war with the Soviet Union became a reality.

At first, the government’s planning included finding ways to save as much of the population as possible. But, according to a new book by Garrett Graff, “Raven Rock: The U.S. Government’s Secret Plan to Save Itself While the Rest of Us Die,” over the years the government’s strategy evolved into a plan that was designed to save only as many governing elites as possible, leaving the rest of the population to fend for itself.

In a recent interview with Inside Edition to discuss his new book (which this writer is reading, by the way), Graff detailed his findings about a series of secret bunkers and other getaways buried into mountains in rural parts of the country that are part of Washington’s COG — “continuity of government” — planning, and one of those facilities is called Raven Rock.

Raven Rock, also known as Site R, is located about an hour outside of Washington, D.C., near Blue Ridge Summit in Pennsylvania. There, you’ll find a massive, Pentagon-like underground emergency operations center; it’s ‘sister’ facilities are the Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center in Virginia and the Cheyenne Mountain Complex in Colorado. Together these facilities form the government’s core COG strategy.

“The government built more than a hundred of these bunkers and relocation facilities around the country,” Graff told Inside Edition, adding that there is no room for families because “the plan is to get a small number of government officials into the bunkers.”

Meanwhile, the fate of the rest of us is grim, to say the least. As noted by the UK’ Daily Mail, a late 1950s government report described how cities should attempt to manage civil defense operations after a nuclear attack:

It said that the area should be divided into ‘mortuary zones’ with ‘collection teams’ in charge of identifying bodies.

Post Office mail trucks would ferry the wounded to one of 900 improvised hospitals set up near attack sites in places like federal prisons.

So devastating would such an attack be, it lead President Dwight Eisenhower, who had witnessed the massive conventional destruction of Europe and Japan as Supreme Allied Commander during World War II, to observe, “The destruction might be such that we might ultimately have to go back to bows and arrows.”

Nevertheless, the government has, for decades, spent untold sums of taxpayer money ensuring they will survive, while the rest of us die. (RELATED: Astrophysicist warns humanity will eventually be wiped out by an asteroid strike… “just a matter of time”)

As noted by Inside Edition:

The title of Graff’s book comes from Raven Rock Mountain, a secret bunker in Pennsylvania where Pentagon brass will re-locate in a nuclear war.

He said the “guest list” includes high-ranking government officials, cabinet leaders, congressional leaders, members of Supreme Court, top aides, White House staff, NSA staff and those who run the bunker.

Along with people, the government has plans in place to save the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence and the Liberty Bell.

There are also some oddities and even some humorous elements of the government’s planning. For example, the Cheyenne Mountain complex is complete with a Subway sandwich shop.

“If you just happen at the time of the apocalypse to be manning the cash register at the Subway you are going to be the only fast food employee in America to survive the nuclear war,” he told Inside Edition.

Raven Rock — as well as all the government’s COG facilities — is staffed 24/7/365, but it’s only been utilized one time: During the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

So, how does the ordinary Dick and Jane American survive? Bugout.news has some tips for that.

(Natural News) The every day mantra of doomsday preppers is to store anything that they could possibly need should an emergency arise. Some might say that they’re going for overkill, but what preppers are doing actually make sense; resources, much like energy, should be conserved, lest we find ourselves one day running out of them.

Aside from storing things that they deem can be of future use, preppers repurpose items to save money. Here are some of the items that they stock-up on and repurpose. You might want to embark on the same endeavor – this will benefit not only you, but also the environment. (Related: Here’s why you should keep your shelter preparations up-to-date and bugout bag close)

Old shoes and boots — A lot of people would not want to get caught dead wearing their old shoes, even if the shoes have no apparent damage. However, no one would care about fashion in the event of an apocalypse. Stocking up on footwear is like stocking up on currency during the apocalypse – you’d be a rich man by the end of all of this.

Wire — You should think twice about throwing away any kind of wire. Conductive wire could be traded for electrical repair or for making a tin can directional WiFi antenna to facilitate communication even after the event of an electromagnetic pulse. Non-conductive wire, on the other hand, can be used to fasten items or put them in place. Store the wires that you’ve collected in a safe and dry spot to avoid getting electrocuted should a wire suddenly come live.

Spare nuts, bolts, and screws — Other types of fasteners that you might save include bolts, screws, and spare nuts to go with the wire that you’re keeping in storage.

Used candles — When electricity becomes a foreign concept, material sources of light would be invaluable. This is why it’s important that as early as today, you don’t get rid of any single candle that comes into your possession. For optimum saving purposes, you might want to gather pieces of candle wax from really short candles and put them all in one container so that they can become a new, bigger candle.

Broken pencils — You might get confused as to what you would do with a broken pencil in the middle of an apocalyptic scenario; you certainly don’t need it to take notes in school. Maybe you would need it to stab an enemy in the eye? In any case, either end of the exposed graphite in the pencil can burst into flames when hooked up to a car battery and cable. Having broken pencils when you don’t have a lighter with you can be very convenient.

Toilet paper rolls — Aiside from their obviously sanitary purposes, toilet paper can serve as tinder for burning. However, if you find yourself needing to use tissues for their intended purpose and none can be found at hand, you can use the leaves of maple, mullein, large leaved aster, cottonwood, hazelnut, thimbleberry, fuzzy lamb’s ear, or grape to clean or wipe yourself or something else.

“ Expired” honey — Raw honey doesn’t really get bad, so as long as your commercially-bought honey is stored in a dry and warm place, you can expect to be able to use it for a long time.

Rusted tools — Keep your rusting tools, because during the apocalypse, the hardware store would likely be closed and ransacked. Clean the old ones that you have now and you might find yourself bartering them for something that you might really need later on.

Dryer lint — Dryer lint is easy to collect, and it can serve as firewood.

Plastic soda and water bottles — Plastic bottles can store a lot of things, but during the event of an apocalypse, you would need to use plastic bottles mostly for drinking water in. You might be on the move, and glass bottles or containers are heavy and not handy to bring along with you, so plastic bottles are essential.

Old clothes — Some people treat clothes as if they’re disposable. Pieces of clothing or fabric are important during a survival situation, as you can repurpose them – aside from being something that you can wear, they can be used as blankets for warming, rags for cleaning, and even as cover for containers.

Wood scraps — You might not need them now, but come crises, you might find wood scraps a valuable resource, especially when you need to light a fire.

Cord, string, and rope pieces — These pieces of items are always good to have during an emergency situation. You never know when you would need to sew clothing (or a wound), or when you would need to bind something.

Broken crayons — Crayons, like candles, are made of wax, so the next time that your child breaks a crayon, keep it. This broken piece can be another ingredient for your homemade wax.

Zip ties — Zip ties, while virtually taking up no space, have lots of uses. They can be used to fasten different items – from containers to bags to jackets.

Coffee grounds — Unused coffee grounds can be used as compost for the garden, so spilled coffee beans should not go to the trash, but instead to a container for storage.

Vegetable scraps — While we are not saying that you shouldn’t be picky with the quality of the food that you eat, you may not want to throw away vegetables just because you don’t like how they look. You may want to use them for compost or as feed for your livestock (if you have any).

Hair clippings — Your compost pile can benefit from hair that you’ve cut or shaved off and which you were going to throw away.

Soap chips — Little pieces of soap that are remnants of your soap’s former glory shouldn’t be thrown away. Instead, try to compress each piece of leftover soap to create a new one.

Broken rubber bands — Repair rubber bands that you thought were forever broken by tying the two ends together, and find yourself in possession of another type of item fastener.

Metal breath mint containers — Small containers like this are perfect for homemade ointments, balms, and salves. Toothpicks and cotton buds can also be placed inside them.

Plastic milk jugs — Why buy pots from the supermarket or grocery store when you can put your plants inside your used milk jug? This is an ideal way to start a garden until such time that you can transfer your plants in a stationary lot.

(Natural News) The country may see the first legal age limits on smartphone sales as Colorado officials approve the language of a ballot proposing to restrict the sale of smartphones to children below 13 years of age. The proposed measure will need 300,000 signatures to be certified for the November 2018 ballot, Coloradoan.com reported.

If the measure were to take effect, smartphone retailers will be banned from selling smartphones — defined in the proposal as any handheld device with internet, data or Wi-Fi connectivity — to children belonging to that age bracket. Businesses will also be required to check the valid ID of the intended primary user to ensure that he or she is of age, as well as submit reports to the Colorado Department of Revenue every month. Those found in violation of the law could be fined a minimum of $500.

The proposal, also known as Initiative 29, was spearheaded by a non-profit group called Parents Against Underage Smartphone Use (PAUS), and was led by Denver anesthesiologist Tim Farnum.

“Eventually kids are going to get phones and join the world, and I think we all know that, but little children, there’s just no good that comes from that,” Farnum told Coloradoan.com, sharing that he experienced problems with his own children when they were given access to smartphones.

“(With smartphones), the internet is always begging for your attention. The apps are all designed to addict you…For children, it’s not a good thing,” he said.

The proposal comes as children continue to be introduced to and use mobile technology at an increasingly early age. One study, according to DailyMail.co.uk, has found that over half of all toddlers can use a tablet at the age of one, and 90 percent of them master the device by the time they turn two.

Studying hundreds of YouTube videos, researchers from the University of Iowa found that over 50 percent of toddlers between 12 to 17 months displayed a “moderate ability” to use a tablet. Researchers defined “moderate” as being able to use apps with help from an adult, but having some difficulty when it comes to basic day-to-day functions.

The researchers also found that by the time babies turned one, they interacted with the tablet in much the same way that adults do, using only their index finger as opposed to using both hands and fingers, as babies younger than one have been observed to do.

Experts have warned against introducing digital media to children at an early age. “Children under two years of age learn best from real-world experiences and interactions,” Carolyn James, a learning designer for Leapfrog Enterprises, told PBS Parents. “Each minute spent in front of a screen-based device is a minute when your child is not exploring the world and using their senses, which is extremely important in their development process.”

PBS Parents recommends that children be allowed to use smartphones to try educational programs and games under close supervision only after they enter preschool. At the same time, unsupervised use and ownership of smartphones should be held off until the child is between 11 to 13 years old, depending on when parents deem they are ready.

Ensuring good content and limiting screen time to no more than 30 minutes per sitting for younger kids, one hour per sitting for older kids, and two hours per sitting for teenagers was also suggested to ensure the healthy incorporation of video tech into kids’ daily activities.

(Natural News) Google is not exactly going out on limb with an announcement that it will block terrorist content on YouTube, but its new initiative certainly appears commendable from a national and international security perspective.

In a Google in Europe blog post authored by its general counsel, the search engine behemoth explained that it is adopting four new guidelines for tackling the issue of online extremism that will combine ramped-up technology with the human element.

In addition to boosting its screening software technology to better identify videos that need to be taken down, YouTube will get an assist from its so-called Trusted Flagger cohort of Google-funded independent experts who will help police the platform.

Google is already working with various government agencies to address violent extremism.

Google also says its getting tougher with inflammatory religious or supremacist content by including warning labels, demonetizing the videos, and otherwise minimizing the opportunity for user engagement. That sounds reasonable and appropriate on its face.

Some controversy over YouTube demonetizing certain political videos has already emerged, effectively implementing a form of revenue-loss censorship. With that said, it remains to be seen how broadly or arbitrarily the term “inflammatory” will be interpreted as a practical matter.

Perhaps most significantly, Google says it is partnering with its Jigsaw subsidiary across Europe for what might be called a form of counter-radicalization programming.

This promising approach harnesses the power of targeted online advertising to reach potential ISIS recruits, and redirects them towards anti-terrorist videos that can change their minds about joining. In previous deployments of this system, potential recruits have clicked through on the ads at an unusually high rate, and watched over half a million minutes of video content that debunks terrorist recruiting messages.

Google also explained that it will collaborate with other social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter as well as software giant Microsoft for additional ways stop the spread of terrorism-related content across the web.

U.K. lawmakers, in particular, have apparently been pressuring tech companies to do more about terrorist-related material online, particularly after terrorist attacks in London and Manchester. According to the Daily Mail, “Technology firms, including Google and its video site YouTube, have been accused of dragging their feet and failing to remove extremist material quickly enough.”

This raises questions as to why Google was so quick to blacklist Natural News for about six days on a flimsy pretext earlier this year. At the time, Naturals News founder Mike Adams expressed these thoughts.

I continue to believe that Natural News was targeted by Google due to the content of our speech which supports President Trump… and that the “sneaky mobile redirects” issue was merely the justification used by Google to de-list the entire NaturalNews.com website. Google no doubt disagrees with this assessment and says it was just a technical issue, yet we are not aware of any other situation in which a minor technical issue on a subdomain resulted in Google blacklisting the entire ROOT domain of a major publisher, with 140,000+ pages of quality content.

Google has also been accused of down-rating other independent journalism and natural medicine sites that don’t share its progressive worldview and destroy their web traffic in the process. Last year, The Intercept reported that Google execs and lobbyists were regular visitors at the Obama White House on a weekly basis and that at least 250 individuals participated in revolving door employment between Google and the Obama administration. (Related: Read more about search engine manipulation at Journalism.news.)

Accused last year of manipulating search results to help the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign, Google is now also deciding for its users what news is real or fake, with the help of leftist fact-checkers.

(Natural News) A committee of the European Space Agency (ESA) has given the green light on its PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) mission, enabling the initiative to transition from blueprint to construction. The project was first introduced three years, with an estimated cost of about 600 million euros. PLATO serves as the agency’s third medium-class celestial operation under its Cosmic Vision program.

PLATO’s primary goal is to gain more knowledge about a large number of exo-planetary systems that are located within the habitable zone and may potentially accommodate life. The project also aims to determine the properties of terrestrial planets that orbit in the habitable zone around sun-like stars. This will help astronomers gain better understanding of how the universe works. Aside from this, the initiative was designed to examine the seismic movements of stars. This in turn will allow scientists to make precise classifications and determine the age of planets surrounding a host star.

“PLATO will for the first time fully characterise these stars and their planets with regard to mass, radius, and age. This will revolutionise the study of the evolution of exoplanets and their host stars,” said Professor Laurent Gizon, director of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Gottingen, Germany.

“The launch of PLATO will no doubt facilitate us with a golden opportunity to have a say in some of the most remarkable discoveries of the next decade. It will help us answer the primary questions about the existence of the world, its formation, and twin-stars, and will eventually lead us to the finding of extraterrestrial life,” said Don Pollacco, a mission associate and professor of Physics at Warwick University.

PLATO will be launched 1.5 million kilometers into space and is slated to examine and monitor thousands of stars. The observatory of the PLATO initiative will make use of 26 telescopes that will work simultaneously. The telescopes will be housed on a single platform and will be used to cover a large portion of the sky. The telescopes will work by searching for slight dips in light when a planet passes between the star it orbits and the powerful telescopes monitoring it. As planets do not emit their own light, they would appear to be dark specs crossing their bright stars, the experts explained. The project will look for planets in the “Goldilocks zone”, an area that is neither too near nor too far from the stars that they orbit. This indicates that the planets’ conditions would be not too hot or too cold, and may potentially hold water to support life.

According to the ESA, the PLATO project is slated for launch in 2026.

Other projects that were instrumental in exoplanet search

PLATO was only the most recent space initiative slated to search for exoplanets. The project is set to follow the National Aeronautics and Space Administration‘s (NASA) Kepler observatory, which has found more than 3,400 confirmed exoplanets so far. Thirty of these exoplanets were less than twice the size of Earth and were located within the habitable zone.

NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope and several dozen ground-based observatories have also made significant contributions in exoplanet search. Discover more news about space exploration at Space.news.

(Natural News) It is something that looked like it was taken straight out of a movie scene: scientists successfully erasing memories from the brain. The only difference is, we’re talking about a snail’s brain here. But there is an eerie possibility that this could soon happen to humans as well.

A new study conducted at the Columbia University Medical Center strongly suggests that it is possible to erase specific memories in the brain. They were able to wipe out specific memories of snails and they think that it is highly possible that a certain drug could be developed for humans.

Samuel Schacher, study co-author and professor of neuroscience in the school’s psychiatry department, wrote in an email as reported in Motherboard.vice.com: “We were able to reverse long-term changes in synaptic strength at synapses known to contribute to different forms of memories.” Synapses are tubes that allow neurons to pass signals to each other. These synapses are responsible for moderating long-term memories. The strength of these synapses will affect the brain’s ability to maintain the memory.”

By blocking certain molecules that are associated with the enzyme Protein Kinase M (PKM), the scientists were able to successfully wipe out certain memories. As reported in the journal Current Biology, scientists were able to erase specific memories by blocking different molecules associated with PKM. Knowing which of these molecules to block will provide scientists the power to decide which memory to erase.

This might sound scary but scientists have a legitimate reason to justify this experiment. Their goal is to provide anxiety relief for those who are suffering post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). When you can erase specific memories – in this case, traumatic experience – these people would be able to live and function more comfortably.

According to the National Institute of Mental Health, PTSD sufferers need not be victims of dangerous events, like war. People who have gone through the death of a loved one can also suffer from PTSD. Other risk factors that can make someone more likely to develop PTSD include getting hurt, childhood trauma, feeling extreme fear, having little to no social support, dealing with extra stress, and history of mental illness or substance abuse. Seven or eight out of 100 people are bound to suffer from PTSD, according to the National Center for PTSD.

PTSD sufferers can be triggered by both associative and non-associative memories. Schacher provides an example: “If you are walking in a high-crime area and you take a shortcut through a dark alley and get mugged, and then you happen to see a mailbox nearby, you might get really nervous when you want to mail something later on.”

The associative memory – one that’s directly connected to the event — is fear of dark alleys — while the non-associative one — not connected to the actual event — would be being triggered after seeing the mailbox. Schacher further added: “One focus of our current research is to develop strategies to eliminate problematic non-associative memories that may become stamped on the brain during a traumatic experience without harming associative memories, which can help people make informed decisions in the future – like not taking shortcuts through dark alleys in high-crime areas.”

This scientific breakthrough is impressive. The ability to wipe out memories used to be possible only in movies but it’s now closer to reality, and has the potential to be used in helping people live more peacefully. But there’s one obvious question: will erasing memories mean erasing ourselves in the process?

Surely there’d be concerns about the ethics of manipulating human minds. They say we’re ultimately made of the experiences we’ve accumulated in life. But what if we no longer remember some of them? Does that make us incomplete?

(Natural News) A team of researchers have recently designed “two-faced” spherical microbots called Janus meant to rid water of harmful bacteria and other microorganisms. The spherical particles were made up of magnesium on one face and alternating layers of gold and iron topped by silver nanoparticles on the other. The magnesium face produced hydrogen bubbles upon contact with water, which then propelled the microbots around contaminated water. On the other hand, the bacteria in contaminated water were expected to stick to the alternating gold and iron face, which would then be killed by the silver nanoparticles.

The researchers examined the microbots in a lab setting and found that Janus particles could propel around the contaminated water for 15 to 20 minutes before the magnesium face was spent. The experts also noted that the spherical microbots were able to trap more than 80 percent of E. coli bacteria. The microbots’ iron content provided it with magnetic properties. Because of this, the microbots could be easily removed from the water using a magnet without leaving behind any potentially dangerous waste.

“Water contamination is one of the most persistent problems of public health. Resistance of some pathogens to conventional disinfectants can require the combination of multiple disinfectants or increased disinfectant doses, which may produce harmful byproducts. Here, we describe an efficient method for disinfecting Escherichia coli and removing the bacteria from contaminated water using water self-propelled Janus microbots…After capture and extermination of bacteria, magnetic properties of the cap allow collection of microbots from water along with the captured dead bacteria, leaving water with no biological contaminants. The presented biocompatible Janus microbots offer an encouraging method for rapid disinfection of water,” the researchers wrote in the American Chemical Society‘s website.

Potential implications in water treatment

The Janus microbots may have potential implications in water treatment and reducing waterborne diseases, which continue to be a large-scale global burden. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 1.1 billion people worldwide lacked access to improved water sources, while 2.4 billion more had no basic sanitation. This added to the global burden of waterborne diseases.

According to the WHO, waterborne gastrointestinal infections kill more than two million people around the world each year, a majority of which occurring in in children living in developing countries. Diarrhea alone was responsible for four percent of all deaths and five percent of health loss to disability worldwide, the WHO noted. The organization also revealed that diarrhea is accounted for up to 8.5 percent of deaths in Southeast Asia, and 7.7 percent of deaths in Africa.

Likewise, the organization stressed that while water use in hygiene is an important preventive measure against gastrointestinal infections, using contaminated water may further exacerbate the condition. In fact, cholera and dysentery cause severe and forms of diarrhea. (Related: Fend off diarrhea with these natural remedies)

On the other hand, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed that four to 32 million cases of acute gastrointestinal illness occur in the U.S. annually despite having one of the safest drinking water systems in the world. The CDC noted that the frequency of diseases from all water exposures may be higher. However, the agency noted that the overall prevalence of waterborne diseases in the country remains unknown.

The latest crypto con: ICO (Initial Coin Offerings) fleece investors while evading regulations

Many modern startup companies are skipping the usual methods of raising funds – things like pitching to venture capitalists, selling stock in an initial public offering, and crowdfunding through sites like Kickstarter – and opting instead for what’s known as an initial coin offering, or an ICO. Capitalizing on the cryptocurrency craze, ICOs are becoming wildly popular because they have the potential to raise needed funds much more quickly than these other more traditional methods, but are they actually a good bet for investors?

According to The New York Times, the way an ICO works is that a startup company will develop its own digital currency, much like Bitcoin, and sell it on the web before it even has a working product to sell to customers. Investors then have the opportunity to buy up these digital coins in order to use them to buy goods and services later on, once the company finally gets up and running. This model has already proven to be a success for many companies, some of which have been able to raise tens of millions of dollars in as little as just a few minutes.

On the flip side, ICOs aren’t currently regulated, nor are they bound by investor protections or handled by qualified accountants, so there’s quite a bit of risk involved in terms of their volatility. Add to this the fact that many ICO investors aren’t even buying in for the purpose of actually using these digital coins for their intended purpose – but rather to get rich quick – and it becomes clear that the ICO model may not be as sustainable as its advocates claim.

ICO expert: Know what you’re doing so you don’t get scammed

The true purpose of an ICO is to allow investors the opportunity to redeem their digital currency buys for services like data storage or anonymous internet access – and, should the currency gain in value during the interim, make a little extra cash as well. But many people are jumping on the ICO bandwagon simply to make lots of money quickly, in many cases without knowing anything about the company into which they’re buying.

“You should understand what the token that is being offered does and have some feel for how large of an opportunity that is,” writes Fred Wilson for AVC.com.

I remember friends buying hot Internet IPOs in the late 90s and I’d ask them why they were investing and they would say to me “I heard its [sic] a hot deal” and I would say “But what does the company do?” and they would say to me “I don’t know, but I know I’m going to make a lot of money.”

That kind of investing is dumb. Be smart and understand what you are buying and why. And if you can’t hold the investment through to the point at which the token will have real utility and real value, you might want to think twice about buying it in the first place.

There’s also the potential for ICO investors to get scammed as, again, the entire market is completely unregulated. Common sense goes a long way, including making sure the company into which you’re buying an ICO actually explains what it is they do and has a workable plan to implement it. Many “newbie” investors who fail to perform due diligence in this area end up getting fleeced out of their hard-earned money.

Building a proper valuation model is also important, as doing so will ensure that you have a better understanding of how your investment will grow over time. Greed is the enemy of smart investing, and unfortunately many of the folks who are taking up ICOs as part of their portfolio are only seeing dollar signs and aren’t using their brains.

Dear Bitcoin ‘Wealth Preservers”, You’re Doing it Wrong

Can you, the reader, substitute Bitcoin for Gold in this statement made by a pre-sellout Alan Greenspan?

(Article by Fay Dress republished from Marketslant.com)

We cannot.

Bitcoin is Not Money (and Neither is FIAT)

Here is why we cannot: Bitcoin is a medium of transfer. It is not money yet. It will likely NEVER be money.

While it shares one excellent characteristic with Gold right now, that being it is a borderless currency, it will not sustain that quality as envious governments, banks, and corporations will demand it be reeled in. And as such, it will NEVER be a substitute for Gold. And we are aware that the use of superlatives is ALWAYS a sign that an argument is specious. So be it.

Bitcoin shares with Gold for the moment the ability to unshackle people’s economic freedom, but it is ludicrous to think it could satisfy the other requirements needed to be called money let alone the other qualities that make gold the best example of the definition of “Money” itself.

Medium of exchange: Bitcoin satisfies this. It is used as a means to transfer your Rubles to Dollars without being “watched”. Not unlike how the USD is used to convert your chicken sales into a purchased cadillac. But different in the sense the Government is watching that trade and will not let you sell your chickens to that guy in Haiti even though he is offering a higher price. Unit of account: Bitcoin is too volatile, and not “commonly accepted” as a standard – although that may change as it evolves. just know that volatility undermines confidence in a currency (Zimbabwe, Reichmarks etc) Store of value: Bitcoin does not hold its value over time. Yes it is growing in value, but that is precisely what we mean. It is also NOT a convenient way to store wealth. Just ask the guy expatriating Yuan to Australia to convert it to USD and his Bitcoins drop 20% in 5 minutes. Stability is key. And Bitcoin has none of that.

FIAT is a horrible long term store of value. Bitcoin is a horrible short term store of value

Do a Sharpe vs Sortino ratio comparison on both BITCOIN and all FIAT to make our volatility point. We are sure the Sharpe ratio will show up as lower in both Bitcoin and FIAT than their Sortino ratios. And the Sortino ratios will show most volatility in Bitcoin is to the upside, while all FIAT will show volatility to the downside.

The USD: slowly sucking you dry.

Sharpe Ratio says “Low Volatility!!” ; Sortino Ratio Replies: Yea but it is all to the downside Post Bretton Woods

Bitcoin: All upside, unless of course you store your wealth in it today and are fine with it being +/- 20 % when you go to buy lunch with it.

We are not going to even show you a BTC chart because it will be obsolete by the time you read this. Suffice to say, until recently, it was alsmost all upside volatility if you mearued it in months. Now it is also showing some downside volatility. But overall, it is more than likely that BTCs Sortino ratio is awesome over its life. Lets put our savings in it. I’ll buy Christmas presents with it in 6 months. What could go wrong? Ok Fine. Here is a chart. It’s what you all came here for isn’t it? The shiny new thing?

CRYPTO CHARTS and Prices HERE



Both FIAT and Bitcoin are Fraudulent Money

Thus based on volatility analysis Bitcoin would be a new hedge fund with a short tremendously positive reason to invest. FIAT is a hedge fund that loses money every year. Yet we keep allocating our assets to it. Both are poor investments for different reasons. Neither is a store of value.

Assuming it does become stable over time, do you think a government will permit Bitcoin to be money? Any central banker who does not abuse his dictatorial privilege, whether rationalized b/c of some monetary dogma (Yellen) or being just plain self-interested (Any Leftist LATAM dictator survival), is not worth his salt as a CBer

It would be easier for China to print 1Trillion Yuan, buy Bitcoins with it, then sell those same coins. This is how easily it would be to destroy confidence in a new currency that is just a medium of transfer so far. Who cares if China loses money on the exit? And they have ways to make sure they do not lose money we are sure. Bitcoins are currently capped. FIAT is not.

To the extent that Bitcoin rallies it is probably a good proxy for demand to leave a country. But what do you do after you’ve gotten out of your Venezuelan Bolivars? You put them in the FIAT of the country you deem as having a more stable currency. To keep your wealth in Bitcoins would be like remaining in a doorway between universes. Sure you could spend them but you’d be hostage to the 100% volatility if you used it as a store of value instead of a transitional medium of exchange from one FIAT to another. Those who buy and hold Bitcoins are likely the speculative class inadvertantly betting on collapse of economies and wealth moving around. That is fine. But do not tell us it is money. At least not yet anyway. It is used practically as a pipeline to some other asset. And that is a medium of exchange.

We’d suggest you take your expatriated Venezuelan wealth and on the other end change it to gold. For when you look at it, No FIAT currency is a store of value. The volatility of FIAT may be low, but by no means does it hold purchasing power.

Gold on the other hand does. So if you are buying BTC as a substitute for Gold because it is enjoying the rally that you’d hoped Gold would get when the world figured out FIAT was fraud; then your premise is wrong. Money is a store of wealth with stable buying power over time. If BTC collapses with your wealth and you’ve bought on this premise, then good luck. Not only will you have confused a Nasdaq stock with a store of value, you will have no wealth left to actually buy something that protects your buying power.. you know GOLD.

So, Where the hell is blockchain product with the Gold front end? To be fair, if a good one even existed ( we haven’t done the work yet) do you think the financial powers and their lackey media shills would discuss it as a viable store of wealth and a liquid medium of exchange? Not likely.

Short of a trade indexed USD, Gold is the best way to hedge your buying power whether it be inflation or deflation you are scared of. Diatribe over.

Recco – Read

Yet more proof we have much to learn below. This is scary to us and a wake-up call to our own naivete on our hope for even the technicological ability to remove a human intermediary in Blockchain exists. It may not.



Blockchain: Almost Everything You Read Is Wrong

Blockchain needs no ‘Human Trust Intermediation’ – so long as you confine yourself to Bitcoin.- Steve Wilson

Introduction

by Soren K. Group

The article is worthy for reading whether you are a Blockchain wonk or not. It explains why Blockchain is NOT going to cure cancer. For us, as semi-wonks we agree. But the last part of the article was new info to us. We had labored under the assumption that Blockchain itself was a catalyst for a banking revolution for 2 reasons. 1- Ledger technology lowers clearing turn-around time and thus makes double transactions all but impossible. (Still true) 2- Its ledger tech obviates the human centralization needed for “trust” verification. (Not so much). Now we need to re-examine. And that is the reason for our headline. To examine what we’ve assumed in the context of this new white-paper:

First: Blockchain May Need Bitcoin- In the last part of the author’s article, he describes that Blockchain without Bitcoin as its front-end does NOT eliminate the need for “trustee” type oversight. We do not claim to know if this is true or not. But it does force us to examine everything we thought we knew about the Blockchain ledger mechanism and our thought that it alone removed the need for centralized “trust” in human form. We do know that corporations are now creating their own products using Blockchain. That fact tells us the Banks are looking to co-opt the tech for cost reduction for sure. But now we must add into our calculus that they might not be disintermediated by their own success at all when their branded products are implemented

Second: We Feel Bitcoin is Doomed in the U.S.- one of the two things that make Blockchain attractive to us is its ability to remove a need for human/ corporate centralized “trustees”. (The other quality is its removal of clearing risk and potential “double dipping” transactions). If Blockchain’s disitntermediation ability is intrinsically tied to using Bitcoin as its front end, then all may be lost in this “Banking revolution”.

For we “know” Bitcoin will not be allowed to prosper here. We feel strongly that once Bitcoin is seen as a threat to the US banking industry (and/or they do not have their own product up and running thereby ring-fencing their own client base) the paid for politicians will be ruthless in stopping it. Banks will reject money for Bitcoin transactions on the grounds of “know your client”. The Government will back this up. Lawmakers and Fed shills like Ken Rogoff will use “But the criminals are using it!” to ban its use. Trust JPM’s Blockchain product! etc etc.

If what Mr. Wilson says is true, and additionally there is no future chance of a front-end asset that uses Blockchain as its pipeline being completely non-dependent on centralized “trustee” oversight in design; then Blockchain is going to be a corporate tool for branding and lowering cost and increasing profit margins for them only. And Bitcoin will crash on the rocks of the U.S. if it attempts to supplant Banking’s most important franchises.

Author Steve Wilson for constellationr.com

Almost everything you read about the blockchain is wrong. No new technology since the Internet itself has excited so many pundits, but blockchain just doesn’t do what most people seem to think it does. We’re all used to hype, and we can forgive genuine enthusiasm for shiny new technologies, but many of the claims being made for blockchain are just beyond the pale. It’s not going to stamp out corruption in Africa; it’s not going to crowdsource policing of the financial system; it’s not going to give firefighters unlimited communication channels. So just what is it about blockchain?

The blockchain only does one thing (and it doesn’t even do that very well). It provides a way to verify the order in which entries are made to a ledger, without any centralized authority. In so doing, blockchain solves what security experts thought was an unsolvable problem – preventing the double spend of electronic cash without a central monetary authority. It’s an extraordinary solution, and it comes at an extraordinary price. A large proportion of the entire world’s computing resource has been put to work contributing to the consensus algorithm that continuously watches the state of the ledger. And it has to be so, in order to ward off brute force criminal attack.

How did an extravagant and very technical solution to a very specific problem capture the imagination of so many? Perhaps it’s been so long since the early noughties’ tech wreck that we’ve lost our herd immunity to the viral idea that technology can beget trust. Perhaps, as Arthur C. Clarke said, any sufficiently advanced technology looks like magic. Perhaps because the crypto currency Bitcoin really does have characteristics that could disrupt banking (and all the world hates the banks) blockchain by extension is taken to be universally disruptive. Or perhaps blockchain has simply (but simplistically) legitimized the utopian dream of decentralized computing.

Blockchain is antiauthoritarian and ruthlessly “trust-free”. The blockchain algorithm is rooted in politics; it was expressly designed to work without needing to trust any entity or coalition. Anyone at all can join the blockchain community and be part of the revolution.

The point of the blockchain is to track every single Bitcoin movement, detecting and rejecting double spends. Yet the blockchain APIs also allow other auxiliary data to be written into Bitcoin transactions, and thus tracked. So the suggested applications for blockchain extend far beyond payments, to the management of almost any asset imaginable, from land titles and intellectual property, to precious stones and medical records.

From a design perspective, the most troubling aspect of most non-payments proposals for the blockchain is the failure to explain why it’s better than a regular database. Blockchain does offer enormous redundancy and tamper resistance, thanks to a copy of the ledger staying up-to-date on thousands of computers all around the world, but why is that so much better than a digitally signed database with a good backup?

Remember what blockchain was specifically designed to do: resolve the order of entries in the ledger, in a peer-to-peer mode, without an administrator. When it comes to all-round security, blockchain falls short. It’s neither necessary nor sufficient for any enterprise security application I’ve yet seen. For instance, there is no native encryption for confidentiality; neither is there any access control for reading transactions, or writing new ones. The security qualities of confidentiality, authentication and, above all, authorization, all need to be layered on top of the basic architecture. ‘So what’ you might think; aren’t all security systems layered? Well yes, but the important missing layers undo some of the core assumptions blockchain is founded on, and that’s bad for the security architecture. In particular, as mentioned, blockchain needs massive scale, but access control, “permissioned” chains, and the hybrid private chains and side chains (put forward to meld the freedom of blockchain to the structures of business) all compromise the system’s integrity and fraud resistance.

And then there’s the slippery notion of trust. By “trust”, cryptographers mean “out of band” or manual mechanisms, over and above the pure math and software, that deliver a security promise. Blockchain needs none of that (Edit: Human Trustee mediation- Soren] – so long as you confine yourself to Bitcoin. Many carefree commentators like to say blockchain and Bitcoin are different things, yet the connection runs deeper than they know. Bitcoins are the only things that are actually “on” the blockchain. When people refer to putting land titles or diamonds “on the blockchain”, they’re using a short hand that belies blockchain’s limitations. To represent any physical thing in the ledger requires firstly a schema – a formal agreement about which symbols in the data structure correspond to what property in the real world – and secondly a process to bind the owner of that property to the special private key (known in the trade as a Bitcoin wallet) used to sign each ledger entry. Who does that binding? How exactly do diamond traders, land dealers, doctors and lawyers get their blockchain keys in the first place? How does the world know who’s who? These questions bring us back to the sorts of hierarchical authorities that blockchain was supposed to get rid of.

There is no utopia in blockchain. The truth is that when we fold real world management, permissions, authorities and trust, back on top of the blockchain, we undo the decentralization at the heart of the design. If we can’t get away from administrators then the idealistic peer-to-peer consensus algorithm of blockchain is academic, and simply too much to bear.

I’ve been studying blockchain for two years now. My latest in-depth report was recently published by Constellation Research.

Every year when it comes time for Americans to pay their federal income taxes, most don’t even bat an eye. That’s because almost nobody alive today remembers a time when federal income taxes didn’t exist. But believe it or not, Americans kept their entire paychecks prior to 1913 (the year the Federal Reserve was born), and former presidential candidate Ron Paul wants to see a return to this pre-1913 America.

A tried-and-true constitutionalist, Paul has been advocating for the abolishment of the Federal Reserve – and it’s enforcement arm, the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) – for decades. When he was running for president, Paul made a point of emphasizing that what America needs isn’t tax reform or even tax cuts, but tax elimination in the form of no more federal income taxes, period.

When asked at a January 16, 2012, debate in South Carolina what the federal income tax rate should be, none of the Republican candidates in the running besides Paul even hinted at abolishing it altogether. Newt Gingrich said 15 percent; Rick Perry said 20 percent; Rick Santorum said 28 percent, and Mitt Romney said 25 percent. But Paul, staying true to his principles, stated:

“We should have the lowest tax that we’ve ever had, and up until 1913, it was 0 percent. What’s so bad about that?”

Federal income taxes are a fraud

While they were originally enacted temporarily to help cover the costs of war, federal income taxes today have become a permanent fixture, despite strict constitutional limits on the federal government’s power. Even later on when the 16th amendment is said to have been ratified (there’s debate over whether or not this legitimately happened), the tax rate was almost negligible.

Folks making incomes of up to $20,000 per yer were taxed on one percent, however there were considerable exemptions from the tax that protected virtually all middle-class Americans from having to pay it. It was nothing like the tax system we have today, where most people pay a significant portion of their incomes to the government – “voluntarily,” of course.

Then there’s the convoluted IRS tax code, which is now more than four million words long. Americans are forced to spend roughly $6 billion annually just to comply with it, as understanding all of its tenets in their proper context basically requires a team of tax lawyers.

And no, the solution isn’t to create a “fair tax,” as some politicians are now suggesting. While doing so would eliminate the need for the IRS and greatly simplify the process, it would still allow the federal government to financially rape and pillage the citizens of the 50 states by forcing them to pay taxes that they shouldn’t have to pay.

“One thing is clear: The Founding Fathers never intended a nation where citizens would pay nearly half of everything they earn to the government,” says Paul. “[And] when I say cut taxes, I don’t mean fiddle with the code. I mean abolish the income tax and the I.R.S., and replace them with nothing.”

Paul’s no-nonsense approach to eliminating the federal income tax is one of the big reasons why he didn’t really stand a chance at becoming president. Along with his relentless condemnation of the private Federal Reserve, which is another corrupt entity that shouldn’t exist, Paul stood at odd with the globalist cabal that profits immensely from taxing the incomes of Americans.

There was a time when President Trump seemed to understand the need to do something about this mess. But so far, there’s no indication that he plans to take anything close to the approach that Ron Paul would have, had he been elected president.

California wants all its citizens to be disarmed so that no one can resist the tyranny that’s coming when the state goes bankrupt

In a letter to James Madison dated December 20, 1787, Thomas Jefferson wrote, “What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms.” This perfectly summarizes the true intent of the Second Amendment, while simultaneously explaining the real reason why modern day democrats oppose the individual right to bear arms so strongly. The fact of the matter is that the Second Amendment wasn’t included in the Bill of Rights so that future generations could legally go out hunting, nor was it written so that Americans could participate in firearm-related sports; it was intended to empower the people to defend themselves and their country against tyranny.

There is a reason why the true purpose of the Second Amendment is never mentioned by liberal democrats. It’s not at all a coincidence that they always talk about the right to bear arms in the context of hunting or sports, conveniently leaving out arguments like the one made by Thomas Jefferson in his letter to Madison. Put simply, they do not recognize anyone or anything that could be used to limit their accumulation of governmental power. To acknowledge that the Second Amendment is meant for defense against tyranny would be to acknowledge that the people have authority over the state, which runs contrary to the entire progressive ideology.

In California, a state known for its out of control bureaucracy, high taxes and excessive regulations, people are often denied access to firearms, and are therefore denied the ability to properly defend themselves from government tyranny should it one day become necessary. And given the current path that California is going down, government tyranny seems all but inevitable.

Back in March, conservative firebrand Ben Shapiro published a piece on his website, The Daily Wire, that sought to expose the growing tyranny in the golden state. The article talks about two members of the Center for Medical Progress, David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt, who were charged by the state of California on 15 felony counts for recording an undercover video of Planned Parenthood workers discussing the sale of aborted fetus body parts.

Even though California is a two-party consent state, meaning that both parties must be aware that a recording is taking place in a private setting, the undercover footage collected by the Center for Medical Progress came from a public restaurant. There was absolutely no reasonable expectation of privacy, which normally should have made the recordings completely legal. But remember, California is a state that is growing more and more tyrannical with each passing day, meaning the rule of law is routinely ignored.

But as any conservative American will tell you, tyranny comes in multiple different forms. Just days after President Trump announced his decision to officially withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement, California Governor Jerry Brown signed his own version of the climate deal with the People’s Republic of China, thus condemning the people of his state to years of burdensome environmental regulations on top of the already existing regulatory state. This too is an example of rising governmental tyranny, because the people are finding themselves less free to pursue their interests as more power is accumulated in the hands of politicians.

Any way you look at it, the fact of the matter is that the state of California is setting itself up for the perfect storm. As the government expands in size and in scope, people are simultaneously being disarmed. History tells us that this is a recipe for disaster, and if voters in California don’t wise up soon, then it’s only going to get worse.

(Natural News) A little over two million people reside in the state of New Mexico. As reported by Healthinsurance.org, there has been a mere “54,653 people enrolled in coverage through the New Mexico exchange during the 2017 open enrollment period” for health insurance. The number of insurers “offering individual market plans statewide” are limited to only four, but, the happy marketeers of the collapsing Obamacare program somehow maneuver language to make everything sound cheery and bright.

For example, they conclude that having only four insurance exchanges for two million people is not dismally inadequate, it’s actually described as more “robust than those in many other states.” And, if a New Mexico constituent is concerned about the impending 80 percent premium increases, well, there’s no need to worry your pretty little head about that. In fact, in the upside down world of Obamacare, that 80 percent increase is actually good news, because “New Mexico’s current premiums are well below the national average.” Well, that may be true, but a New Mexico Obamacare premium, which is $366 per month — before the subsidy kicks in — is still going up as much as 80 percent, isn’t it? Those other 34 states using “federally facilitated exchanges” provide policies with an average monthly premium of $475 before the subsidy. Aren’t most of those going up too? Of course.

ZeroHedge.com suggests that we look a little deeper to get the true trajectory of Obamacare price increases in New Mexico. Between 2013 and 2017, the Obamacare premiums had already increased 100 percent for New Mexico residents. Adding the impending 80 percent increase in 2018 “would imply a 250 percent increase in just five years.” These rising prices continue to bring hardship to small businesses, families and the overall economy. The tentacles run deep and it’s been a long, tough process to overturn, although the intrepid President Trump remains hopeful in his comments reported by USnews.com:

“But I think we’re going to get it. We don’t have too much of a choice because the alternative is the dead carcass of Obamacare.”

That hope could be short lived, even with a dead Obamacare carcass looming in the backdrop. Some Senate Republicans remain opposed to the latest revision of the new Senate health bill. Senator Susan Collins, R-Maine, isn’t happy about Medicaid cuts and removing the Planned Parenthood subsidy. Senator Rand Paul, R-Kentucky is another Republican who says he still can’t support the new plan. In the meantime, rising premiums are the rule in New Mexico, all in the midst of Washington trying to make sense of subsidies, exchanges, pre-existing conditions, Medicaid payouts and so much more.

The idea of the U.S. government running and mandating personal health insurance by giving subsidies to buy it, and then initiating income tax penalties if you refused, never set too well with freedom loving citizens, even though they were “promised” by then President Obama that if you liked your doctor and your plan you could simply keep them. Remember that?

And then, once the lobbyists of the death care industry, pharmaceutical and insurance industries paid billions to get the bill written and passed, there was that small problem about the roll out of the website. Hmmm. This was just the beginning of a bad system now ready to crash and burn.

Imagine how the nation’s health would improve if all those billions of dollars had been invested in organic food, water without fluoride, heavy metals or pesticides or one of the most powerful antioxidant substances in the world, Hawaiian Astaxanthin. But the sick care industry would much rather that you are injected with your yearly flu shot and endure whatever procedure they want to pay for on the failing Obamacare list. Let’s just say no, shall we?

Trump lawyer Sekulow asks the obvious: Why isn’t there a special counsel investigating President Obama over “Russia” allegations?

As the Republican-led Congress mysteriously continues to investigate their own president over still-unproven allegations he and his inner circle pulled off the election crime of the century by “colluding” with Russia to “steal the election” from Hillary Clinton, one of Donald J. Trump’s lawyers is asking a very pertinent question: How come former President Obama isn’t being investigated?

After all, attorney Jay Sekulow maintained, Obama was president during last year’s election cycle, and according to recent reports, he was well-aware that Russia was attempting to meddle in the American election (though he and his former intelligence community chiefs have all said no Russian tampering changed ANY election results).

During a recent appearance on Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom” program with host Shannon Bream, Sekulow singled out the former president, asking why a special counsel isn’t looking into his actions and those of his administration more thoroughly.

“Why do we have a special counsel dealing with the Russia hacking when they had that evidence and did nothing?” Sekulow said. “Why don’t we have a special counsel [former FBI Director Robert Mueller] reviewing why President Obama did nothing after he assured the American people — he gets intelligence briefings but assures the American people that Russia did not interfere with the election?”

As for his client, there is nothing there, Sekulow added. (RELATED: Why does the GOP-run Congress have time to investigate Trump, THEIR president, but no time to pass his agenda?)

“You know when the president said early on this was a witch hunt?” Sekulow said. “Every day that goes by, I’m not sure that’s fair to witch hunts to keep calling it that. It’s beyond that.”

Mediaite, which was reporting on the Sekulow interview, made sure to mention reports in Left-wing papers The Guardian and The Washington Post claiming that “millions of dollars were funneled to Sekulow’s family from a charity controlled by Sekulow.” But a closer read of both stories shows that they also included a statement by Sekulow’s spokesman, Gene Kapp, denying that there were any legal or moral improprieties — something Mediaite conveniently left out.

In any event, Sekulow’s main point remains valid: What did Barack Obama know, when did he know it, and more importantly, why didn’t he adequately respond?

Whether the Post realized it or not, the paper essentially threw the former president under the bus in a recent 8,000-plus word piece that contained scores of illegally leaked information that essentially claimed Obama was well-aware of Russian cyber activity aimed at disrupting the U.S. election, but chose to do as little as possible about it.

The evidence, which was presented to Obama by the CIA, was said to be so damning that “the Obama administration secretly debated dozens of options for deterring or punishing Russia, including cyberattacks on Russian infrastructure, the release of CIA-gathered material that might embarrass Putin and sanctions that officials said could ‘crater’ the Russian economy,” the Post said, adding: “But in the end, in late December, Obama approved a modest package combining measures that had been drawn up to punish Russia for other issues — expulsions of 35 diplomats and the closure of two Russian compounds — with economic sanctions so narrowly targeted that even those who helped design them describe their impact as largely symbolic.”

That report directly conflicts with what Obama himself has said publicly about Russia’s inability to “hack” into U.S. electronic voting systems, who noted that “no serious person out there” could believe U.S. voting systems could be hacked and changed because they’re too diverse and too dispersed. In addition, Obama’s cyber security expert, Michael Daniel, told Israel Army Radio this week that Russia did not “hack the election” in any way that changed votes.

The American press knows this.

The American Congress knows this.

Trump knows it, and so do his detractors.

But the question Sekulow asks remains relevant: Why isn’t the 44th president and his staff being hauled before House and Senate panels to answer questions about Russia’s 2016 election involvement?

Voter fraud investigation: Trump criticizes Left-wing states over failure to comply with voter commission’s information requests

“What are they trying to hide?”

That was the question President Donald J. Trump tweeted out Saturday morning in response to some far-Left states who are refusing to comply with voter registration information as part of an investigation by a special commission he established to look into nationwide voter fraud.

“Numerous states are refusing to give information to the very distinguished VOTER FRAUD PANEL,” Trump tweeted. “What are they trying to hide?”

Numerous states are refusing to give information to the very distinguished VOTER FRAUD PANEL. What are they trying to hide? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 1, 2017

As reported by Fox News, officials in California and New York have said they won’t respond to requests from the voter fraud commission that is headed up by Vice President Mike Pence. Trump established the commission in the wake of the 2016 election, in which he alleged that perhaps as many as five million people voted illegally, thereby giving his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, a popular vote majority.

Interestingly enough, Clinton’s entire majority came from one state — California — that is also now refusing to comply with the president’s efforts to ensure only those who have a legal right to vote do so.

Democrats have decried Trump’s effort as little more than an attempt to suppress voting rights, which is, of course, ludicrous, given that the initiative is aimed specifically at ensuring the integrity of balloting. But then again, given that Democrats have been behind efforts nationally to subvert or block voter ID laws at every turn, most people believe their party is primarily benefitting from illegal voters, no matter how limited or widespread the problem actually is.

But we won’t know until the president’s commission completes its work. And we won’t have a complete picture at all if Left-wing Democrat-run states refuse to cooperate.

Not all Democrats are opposed to the effort. On Friday Bill Gardner, New Hampshire’s Democratic secretary of state and a member of the vote fraud commission defended the information request. He added that a number of states may only comply partially, due to differing open records laws in states.

“If only half the states agree, we’ll have to talk about that. I think, whatever they do, we’ll work with that,” he said, noting further that the commission plans to discuss the information request survey at a July 19 meeting.

He also said he’s been getting calls from angry constituents who said they did not want the president to see their personal information, but noted: “This is not private, and a lot of people don’t know that.”

Opposition is also coming from some red states that voted for Trump; including Texas, where officials said because of state laws they could only partially comply with the commission’s information request. (RELATED: As Promised, Trump Empanels White House Commission To Examine Extent Of Voter Fraud)

Mississippi Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann, a Republican, said he has not yet received the request, but if/when he does, he will say, as quoted by Fox News: “They can go jump in the Gulf of Mexico, and Mississippi is a great state to launch from. … Mississippi residents should celebrate Independence Day and our state’s right to protect the privacy of our citizens by conducting our own electoral processes.”

Fox News reported further:

In a federal court case after a contentious U.S. Senate primary in Mississippi in 2014, a group called True the Vote sued Mississippi seeking similar information about voters. Hosemann fought that request and won.

And no state election commission is going to provide all of the requested information.

Still, there is at least anecdotal evidence to support Trump’s claim that voter fraud in the U.S. is a much bigger problem than many believe. Last month a study was published showing that as many as 5.7 million non-citizens may have illegally voted in the 2008 election.

“The White House has provided enormous evidence with respect to voter fraud, with respect to people being registered in more than one state,” White House policy adviser Stephen Miller told ABC’s “This Week” in March, amid calls for Trump to provide evidence for his claims.

DHS working to mitigate devastating car bomb attacks in the United States that have killed scores of people in Iraq and Afghanistan

One of the most deadly strategies used by anti-U.S. and coalition forces in both Iraq and Afghanistan is the VBIED — Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Device — or, as they are more commonly known, “car bombs.” One of the most deadly of these attacks in recent history occurred in July 2016, when a refrigerator truck filled with explosives was detonated near a crowded apartment block in Baghdad’s Karrada neighborhood, killing 323 people.

That attack was followed by one in Kabul, Afghanistan, in May of this year; a VBIED tanker truck blew through the embassy quarter of the city, killing more than 150 people. Despite blast protection, a number of embassies, including the French and German structures, were damaged.

And while these kinds of attacks seem to only occur in distant lands, U.S. officials are increasingly concerned that they could start happening in America.

In fact, it almost has. In May 2010, police discovered a crude car bomb consisting of propane tanks, gasoline and fireworks smoking in a Nissan Pathfinder parked in the heart of Times Square. The New York Times reported that the discovery prompted “the evacuation of thousands of tourists and theatergoers on a warm and busy night.”

The device was in the process of detonating when police found it. (RELATED: Former NYPD chief: “New normal” terror attacks in Europe are coming soon to a U.S. city near you — it’s time to arm yourself)

Today, the Department of Homeland Security’s Science and Technology Directorate’s Explosives Division has begun taking this threat seriously.

As reported on the Homeland Security website:

EXD’s Homemade Explosives (HME) program conducts Large–Scale VBIED testing to mitigate the threat posed by massive car bombs and to ensure such attacks do not occur in the U.S. This program is part of S&T’s Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency.

Recently, S&T EXD conducted a series of explosives tests with varying charge sizes to learn more about mitigating these threats, based on the size and composition of the explosive device.

Testing has been carried out at the U.S. Army’s Fort Polk, La., featuring experts from the U.S. Naval Surface Warfare Center’s Indian Head facility and the live-fire testing capability of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Engineering, Research, and Development Center in Vicksburg, Miss.

“Due to the wide variety of types of and materials used to make improvised explosives, we often must use simulations to model the behavior of large scale events. When current methods are no longer effective, we have to conduct controlled real-life events to discover new ways of combatting emerging trends in explosives,” program director Dave Hernandez said, the website reported.

Data from testing at Fort Polk provided researchers with the ability to understand the scope of damage different types of explosive materials can cause. Researchers noted that this kind of specific damage information was not available before the tests were staged.

“The information generated from this testing will aid the Department of Defense and law enforcement communities by revealing data on the impact of a large–scale VBIED, enabling better protection for vulnerable targets. As the HME threat is constantly changing, a continued effort in this area is required in order to provide timely information to those organizations conducting analysis and acquisitions,” Program Manager Elizabeth Obregon noted.

Obviously, we expect appropriate federal agencies and the Pentagon to ‘war game’ various terrorism scenarios, because that allows them to adopt the proper counter-strategies. But the fact that DHS and the Pentagon are researching this particular threat is telling in and of itself, for it means that someone, somewhere, believes this form of terrorism may be coming to American cities sooner rather than later.

Trump trolls CNN with tweet showing him “wrestling” and beating down the network, as the Left once again predictably freaks out

You have to hand it to President Donald J. Trump. When he is attacked, he hits back mercilessly, and once his prey is wounded, he moves in for the kill.

Figuratively speaking, of course. The only people who have really entertained the thought of “killing” has been the unhinged Left and its leaders in the Democratic Party, and it always involves some sort of assassination porn involving Trump.

The only people who have really entertained the thought of “killing” has been the unhinged Left and its leaders in the Democratic Party, and it always involves some sort of assassination porn involving Trump.

Well, the president upped his game against fake news network CNN on Sunday, tweeting out a doctored clip from his pro wrestling days, showing him pummeling an opponent whose face was covered with CNN‘s logo.

And he included in his tweet this hashtag: #FraudNewsCNN and #FNN, the latter standing for — what else? — Fraud News Network.

Trump has been at war, so to speak, with the Washington establishment media — or, more correctly, it has been at war with him, in collusion with the Deep State — since he beat two-time presidential loser Hillary Clinton last November.

And while Trump has been volleying with the media here and there, constantly trolling them with early morning tweets that have generally been mild rebukes, he now appears to have decided it’s time to take the gloves off.

Last week one of his White House spokespersons, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, warned the press that Trump had adopted a new combativeness towards what he correctly views is an unfairly hostile media.

When Trump gets “hit” by insulting attacks that have nothing to do with policy and everything to do with him personally, “he’s going to hit back,” she said. “He fights fire with fire,” she added, noting that he “has been attacked mercilessly” by all Washington establishment media outlets. (RELATED: Anatomy of CNN’s fake news scandal: They knew Russian conspiracy hit piece was fake all along, but ran the story anyway)

Indeed, she continued, the American people “knew what they were getting” when voters in a majority of states sent him to Washington: “A fighter.”

And now, apparently, he is a fighter who has taken off his gloves, so to speak.

It’s about time, frankly. Last week, CNN published yet another fake news story it was forced to retract, claiming a former Trump campaign associate was being investigated by the Senate for alleged improper contact with a Russian financial firm just days before Trump took office (to perpetuate the phony “Russian collusion” narrative nobody’s been able to show any proof of).

Also last week, Trump responded forcefully to yet another attack on his “manhood” by MSNBC “Morning Joe” co-host Mika Brzezinski, who made a comment about his “teensy hands.” That tweet, like the most recent CNN wrestling tweet, once again left unhinged Democrats and liberals apoplectic.

Fox News reported on CNN’s response to the President’s latest tweet:

CNN responded almost immediately to Trump’s tweet on Sunday by referring to a comment last week by White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

“The President in no way form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence. If anything, quite the contrary.” – @SHSanders45 6/29/17,” CNN’s public relations office tweeted.

The network later released the following full statement: “It is a sad day when the President of the United States encourages violence against reporters.”

Sure. But the Left — including the irrational, hate-filled hosts and their guests on the various news networks — can condone or consciously choose not to condemn anyone on the Left advocating the assassination of the president or otherwise bringing him harm.

CNN‘s assertion was then parroted, as usual, by Democrats: Rep. Ted Lieu of California called it “beyond disturbing.”

What Trump tweeted was a hilarious wrestling clip altered to fit the current flap with CNN. If the pansies at that network really saw that as “the president supporting violence against journalists,” then they are just as likely to also blame spoons for obesity and cars for speeding tickets.

What the president is doing now is simply trolling the media, which has no sense of humor, takes itself far more seriously than the average American, and cannot stand being treated the same way it treats him.

F-35 fighter jet project a total BUST… planes don’t work, nearly a trillion dollars flushed down a dark hole

The F-35 fighter jet project is the most expensive weapons system ever designed, but apparently no one is sure that it works or that it will meet expectations.

About 10 years behind schedule and as yet not living up to all of its design requirements, American taxpayers will have to cough up about $1.5 trillion to pay the tab before all is said and done. Approximately $100 billion-plus has already been spent on the program in sunk costs for planes that have a price tag of about $100 million each, apparently double what was originally promised.

President Trump has managed to convince Lockheed Martin to drop the unit cost by $7 million, but the project still appears to be an out-of-control boondoggle according to some military experts.

This week, the Marine Corps grounded all F-35s at its Yuma, Arizona air station because of software issues that affected the onboard autonomic logistics information system. Over the past six years, military officials have temporarily grounded F-35 operations 15 times for hypoxia-related incidents, the most recent at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, after pilots suffered dizzy spells and disorientation.

According to retired Air Force officer and finance professor Michael P. Hughes writing for The Conversation website, “Essentially, the Pentagon has declared the F-35 ‘too big to fail.'”

It gets worse. The F-35 fighter, which is scheduled for a 2070 phase out, is not very stealthy despite marketing hype to the contrary, the Daily Mail explained.

Will Trump sue the “horrible human beings” at fake news central CNN? Prez considers it

President Donald J. Trump lit into fake news network CNN during a speech at a fundraising dinner Wednesday night, even hinting at one point that he is considering suing the Atlanta-based media company, Breitbart News reported.

According to audio of Trump’s speech at a private Republican National Committee fundraiser at his own hotel in Washington, D.C., obtained by The Intercept, the president is heard calling top members of CNN’s staff “horrible human beings” while he verbally mulled a lawsuit over the network’s many fake news stories.

“Wouldn’t that be fun?” Trump said.

The president also addressed the failing network’s most recent troubles, most notably a recent retraction of a CNN.com story alleging nefarious ties between former campaign official and fundraiser Anthony Scaramucci and a Russian investment fund, in addition to recently released undercover videos showing a CNN producer and a top political contributor debunking the Russia “collusion” and “hacking” narratives.

“Boy, did CNN get killed over the last few days,” Trump says to loud applause.

Earlier this week James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas released a video showing CNN producer John Bonifield calling the Russia narratives “bulls**t.”

“I mean, it’s mostly bullsh*t right now,” Bonifield says. “Like, we don’t have any giant proof,” he is seen saying on video:

In addition, top political contributor and former Obama administration jobs czar Van Jones is also caught on undercover video dismissing the Russia-Trump allegations, calling it a “nothing burger.”

“The Russia thing is just a big nothing burger,” he says.

“Really?” the undercover media operative replies.

“Yep,” says Jones.

That is here:

As reported further by Breitbart News:

In his remarks Wednesday, Trump referred to the Van Jones tape and asked his audience if he should sue CNN, calling its staff — including President Jeff Zucker — “horrible human beings.”

“Van Jones — you see this guy?” Trump said, then mocked him for calling the over-hyped Russia controversy a “nothing burger.” (RELATED: Obama accidentally exposes Russia HOAX: “No serious person” believes the Russians could “rig America’s elections”)

“These are really dishonest people. Should I sue them? I mean, they’re phonies. Jeff Zucker, I hear he’s going to resign at some point pretty soon. I mean, these are horrible human beings.”

Wednesday’s comments regarding coming shake-ups at the troubled network were not the president’s first on the issue. Earlier in the week he tweeted about “big management changes” coming to CNN:

Fake News CNN is looking at big management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony Russian stories. Ratings way down! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 27, 2017

Trump then pivoted back to the possibility of suing the network, which he said has been destroyed by Zucker and other top management.

“It’s a shame what they’ve done to the name CNN. That, I can tell you,” Trump said. “But as far as I’m concerned, I love it. If anybody’s a lawyer in the house and thinks I have a good lawsuit — I feel like we do. Wouldn’t that be fun?”

Trump’s perhaps light-hearted, perhaps serious, threat follows a real lawsuit filed against The New York Times by former GOP vice presidential nominee and Alaska governor Sarah Palin last week. As reported by the National Sentinal:

“Today, Sarah Palin took a stand against The New York Times Company by filing a lawsuit which seeks to hold The Times accountable for stating that Governor Palin is part of a ‘sickeningly familiar pattern’ of politically motivated violence and that she incited the horrific 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords, a tragedy where the gunman seriously wounded numerous people and killed 6, including a federal judge and a 9-year-old girl,” Palin’s lawyers—Ken Turkel, Shane Vogt, and S. Preston Ricardo—said in a statement.

Filed in Manhattan federal court, the complaint further states that “at the time of publication, The Times knew and had published pieces acknowledging that there was no connection between Mrs. Palin and Loughner’s 2011 shooting.”

The lawyers are the same legal eagles used by former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan to successfully sue Gawker for defamation, to the tune of more than $100 million.

The Times made their discredited charge within days of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., and GOP aides being shot by a far-Left activist and supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.

Snap Inc. just crashed to its IPO price as tech bubble begins to unravel, shocking young, gullible investors who think wealth is generated by magic

It hasn’t even been four months since Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat, made its initial public offering (IPO), and there are already some serious financial troubles brewing for the social media giant. After seeing an initial climb to an all-time high of $27.09 on March 3, just one day after the company’s IPO, Snap’s stock value has since plunged by a whopping 37 percent.

Ever since its IPO, in fact, Snap has seen its stock value move progressively downward, and as a result its bank underwriters, including JPMorgan, have adopted a bearish outlook on the company. The biggest problem for Snapchat is that the company is having a difficult time keeping up with its competitors like Facebook and Instagram, both of which have adopted similar photo-sharing platforms that appear to be more popular among social media users.

Despite recently releasing a new feature known as the Spectacles camera, Snap hasn’t really seen any significant increases in its bottom line. This rough ride for Snap has generated a dim outlook for the company among investors, including executives and company insiders who might want to flee the questionable stock, but won’t be able to until their 150-day lockup period expires at the end of July.

Part of the problem for Snapchat is that it simply isn’t attracting enough new users to meet its company goals. Underwriter JPMorgan, which recently downgraded its price target for Snap by 10 percent from $20 to $18, estimates that only about eight million new users will join Snapchat in the second quarter of 2017. This is down from an earlier estimate of 10 million new users during the same period.

This means that Snap is now not expected to show any profit until 2020, despite its rollout of a new advertising service last year that seemed to be on the up and up. Most of this service’s growth, however, was centered around the Olympics and the U.S. election, both of which are one-time events that won’t happen again for another three-plus years – and there’s nothing this year in the pipeline to replace them.

Meanwhile, revenue estimates for the recently debuted Snapchat Spectacle product have been cut nearly in half from $119 million in 2017 to just $56 million. So Snapchat really doesn’t have anything left going for it in the foreseeable future that would drive back up its stock price to reassure investors.

Snap signs $100 million deal with Time Warner that boosts stock price by three percent

On the other hand, shares of Snap did bounce up slightly after the company’s recent announcement of a new agreement with Time Warner to produce an original television series based on the service. Reports indicate that the stock value for Snap increased by nearly three percent following the announcement of the $100 million deal.

This partnership with Time Warner is critical for Snap as it seeks to regain a strong footing in the tech market. It also follows the trend of other tech companies like Netflix, Amazon, and Apple that are all competing for their own original shows as well.

“Snap typically broadcasts one show a day in its app under a ‘Shows’ header,” reports Business Insider. “They are all five to 10 minutes and made in participation with networks like NBC, ABC, BBC, A&E, Discovery, Vice, and others. Shows have collectively drawn ‘audiences of over 8 million,” Snap C.E.O. Evan Spiegel said during the company’s latest earnings call.”

Snap is hoping to have two to three shows air in its app every single day by the end of 2017. It remains to be seen if this will generate the buzz needed to give Snap the critical boost it needs to stay afloat.

(Natural News) You don’t have to be a geologist to understand that an earthquake in the vicinity of a volcano could be a disaster waiting to happen, but what if there were nearly 900 quakes near a supervolcano?

That is the situation that is playing out right now in Yellowstone National Park, where 878 earthquakes have struck since June 12. Most of the quakes had a very low magnitude, but the strongest one, which was recorded on June 15, had a magnitude of 4.4. The park rests atop one of the most dangerous supervolcanoes on the planet, prompting fears that it could be about to blow. Any doubts about its active state can be dispelled by the sight of Old Faithful, shooting water up every few hours.

While earthquake swarms are not unusual in Yellowstone, the week of June 12 saw the highest number of quakes to be noted in a single week in five years. Although the risk of eruption remains low overall and the volcano alert level has not been raised from green, it is believed that if it does erupt, it could be 1,000 times as powerful as the one at Mount St. Helens in 1980.

This particular volcano has been dormant for more than 70,000 years, but that does not mean it won’t erupt again eventually. It’s impossible to predict when that might occur, but seismic activity can signal a potential eruption. Four years ago, researchers discovered that the underground magma chamber of the volcano was more than twice as big as previously believed, encompassing an area of land that measures 56 by 19 miles.

Huge ash cloud could devastate Western U.S.

Should the volcano erupt, the resultant ash, smoke and lava would most likely cause widespread devastation in this country and also have an effect on the rest of the world. It is believed that an eruption there would see molten lava hotter than 1,000 degrees, but the biggest concern is the ash. Scientists believe it could emit ash that extends over 500 miles, stretching from California all the way to Texas and Louisiana. It would likely leave as many as four inches of gray ash on the ground, destroying Midwestern crops.

It could also spew out gases like sulfur dioxide, creating acid rain and leading to global cooling by reflecting the sun from the Earth. While it might not wipe out human life entirely, it would certainly create a lot of damage across the western side of our nation.

Another concern in that part of the country is a gigantic well of molten carbon that was discovered under the park earlier this year. Spanning 700,000 square miles, this section of upper mantle is about the size of Mexico and creates specific seismic patterns as solid carbonates melt. If a significant amount of the gases in this deposit are suddenly released into our atmosphere, it could spur an environmental disaster akin to nuclear warfare.

As for the Yellowstone supervolcano, it has only had three major eruptions in the last 2 million years. Geologists say that other signs would also likely occur if the volcano was on the verge of blowing, such as big changes in the surface deformation, gas output, and the hydrothermal system.

Even though this latest round of earthquakes will likely – and hopefully – amount to nothing just like similar earthquake swarms in the past, the news serves as a reminder that it never hurts to prepare for events like this one. Waiting for more signs of impending doom, whether it’s a volcano or another type of threat, will place you in competition with other people for scarce resources, so the time to start stocking up and making a plan is now.

(Natural News) A recent study published in Environmental Science & Technology revealed that concentrations of airborne polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may persist in schools and may cause some students to breathe in the chemicals, which in turn may expose them to higher levels than when they inadvertently consume the chemicals through food. PCBs are toxic synthetic compounds that were banned in the U.S. nearly forty years ago. Before being banned, the chemicals were used in different industrial applications such as pints and building materials. Various industries were once known to dump PCB-containing waste into rivers and streams, which eventually resulted in massive environmental clean-ups.

While PCBs are no longer available in the U.S., the chemicals may still be seen in older buildings that once used them. Past studies have associated PCB exposure — through inhalation, ingestion, or skin contact — with adverse health effects such as cancers and developmental issues. Children are at an increased risk of these health woes. As part of the current study, a team of researchers at the University of Iowa examined the air quality both inside and outside of six schools, four of which are located within 1.5 miles of the Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal to determine the children’s PCB exposure.

The study revealed that PCB concentrations were higher inside all the schools than outside them, at about 194 nanograms per cubic meter. However, the concentration levels were below the current U.S. Environmental Protection Agency‘s recommended action level of 500 ng/m3. The research team also found that the sources of PCB exposure varied among schools, suggesting that historical contamination and new paint have something to do with these variations.

“This is the first time we’ve been able to pinpoint the source of PCBs inside schools. This study shows that the indoor air is contaminated, and that contamination is due to materials that remain in use in the school buildings. The results of our study are really quite chilling. To put it simply, any school that hasn’t been remodeled since the 1970s may have high levels of PCBs in the air, which children breathe day in and day out,” said researcher Professor Keri C. Hornbuckle.

Lead researcher Professor Peter S. Thorne stressed that the nation’s schools must provide students with a safe and healthy environment to facilitate growth and development. The health expert said schools should not contribute to increased exposure to persistent pollutants.

Previous studies link PCB exposure to cancer onset

A large number of studies have shown that PCB exposure may increase the risk of developing cancer. For instance, a 2012 study carried out by the Public Health Institute revealed that women who were exposed to three types of PCB during their reproductive years were three times as likely to develop breast cancer by age 50 than those who had significantly lower chemical exposure.

“To our knowledge, this is the first study to report on breast cancer associations in relation to measured PCB blood levels during critical periods of vulnerability for the breast. What is concerning is that important exposures happened decades before these women’s cancer actually developed. And women are still being impacted today. One must ask, what are the long-term effects of chemicals on the market today? And how can we do a better job of protecting ourselves?” lead author Barbara A. Cohn wrote in the PHI’s website.

Another study revealed that exposure to higher concentrations of mono-ortho polychlorinated biphenyls is associated with an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer.

The findings were published in Environmental Health Perspectives, the flagship journal of the National Institute Of Environmental Health Sciences.

(Natural News) It’s shocking — and depressing — that despite an estimated 842 million starving people in different parts of the world, we are wasting as much as 20 pounds of food each month. That’s according to Ruth Litchfield, professor of food science and human nutrition at Iowa State University.

“It’s a huge problem. When you think that 40 percent of the food produced in the U.S. goes to waste, that is just irresponsible,” Litchfield said. It’s very likely that the fresh produce you have inside your refrigerators are going to end up in the trash can instead of on your plate. The food science professor notes that even though people don’t initially intend to throw food in the trash, they do it more often than they realize.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, approximately 1.3 billion tonnes of food produced each year gets lost or wasted. That’s almost a third of the all the food produced in the world. This wastage is not cheap. In fact, food losses amount to about $680 billion in developed countries and $310 billion in developing nations.

Incidentally, fruits and vegetables, as well as roots and tubers are the top food items to get thrown. Based on global data, quantitative food losses per year are almost 30 percent for cereals, 40 to 50 percent for root crops, fruits and vegetables, 20 percent for oil seeds, meat and dairy, and 35 percent for fish.

Litchfield blames the food wastage to the pervasive mentality about food: that more is better. She said people need to stop thinking that it’s better to stock up on more food when grocery shopping or ordering large portions at restaurants. Based on a 2012 study on food waste, the top contributor to food waste is the home (44 percent) right after the food service industry (33 percent).

There are several ways to avoid this. As long as consumers are aware of the impact of their habits and take the relatively small steps to limit food waste, they should be able to save money. Litchfield recommends doing the following:

Find an alternate use for produce – Granted that you might not be able to consume everything before they wilt, you can try making other dishes where you can still use the ingredient, like as an additive to soups, etc.

– Granted that you might not be able to consume everything before they wilt, you can try making other dishes where you can still use the ingredient, like as an additive to soups, etc. Weekly meal planning – Planning your meal will ensure you don’t waste anything because everything is accounted for. You won’t have to get more than you need because you’ve already set a plan. It’s recommended to use frozen or canned items because they can last until the following week.

– Planning your meal will ensure you don’t waste anything because everything is accounted for. You won’t have to get more than you need because you’ve already set a plan. It’s recommended to use frozen or canned items because they can last until the following week. Understand “sell by” dates – Those “best before” labels are actually contributing to food waste because people unknowingly throw food items thinking that they’re already unsafe for consumption. The truth of the matter is the date doesn’t really have anything to do with the safety of the food, but the quality. The only product required by the government to have an expiration date is infant formula.

Try composting – By composting at home, you’re basically reducing the quantity of waste that’s thrown into landfills.

Know that throwing away food is synonymous to wasting natural resources. You’re also contributing to methane gas emission and climate change. What’s most heart-breaking is, you’re taking away food from people who really need it the most.

There are simple ways to avoid food wastage, according to Susan Arendt, professor of hospitality management at Iowa State: donate foods to shelters or soup kitchens, use leftover foods to other menu items, or working with farmers to use leftovers as livestock feed. But the real solution should be simple enough: get only what you can eat.

(Natural News) They had it coming. Beekeepers weren’t too surprised when studies came out and confirmed that neonic pesticides were killing worker and queen bees.

The study published in Journal Science found that 25 percent of bees that were exposed to high levels of neonic pesticides lose their lives. Study co-author Amro Zayed from the Toronto York University said: “We found higher worker mortality, deficits in learning and memory, differences in queen and reproductive biology. All of these have been found in other experiments by other researchers. So we’re validating all of these findings.”

It didn’t come as a surprise to beekeepers since neonic pesticides have already been in use for years now. Neonicotinoids belong to a new class of insecticides that are chemically related to nicotine. Neonicotinoid literally means “new nicotine-like insecticides” and it acts on certain kinds of receptors in the nerve synapse. A neonicotinoid is more likely to be lethal to invertebrates, like insects, rather than birds, mammals, and other organisms. It is popular because of its water solubility, which means it can be incorporated to soil and then absorbed by plants.

But using neonicotinoids may have serious repercussions to the ecosystem. An international study, as reported in CBC.ca, showed that one of the most common neonicotinoid pesticides is disrupting the reproductive health of wild bumblebees. The exposure to the chemical can affect the bees’ breeding cycle, and when that happens, it follows that there would be a decline in their numbers. Since bees are vital to farmers because they play a significant role in agriculture, losing wild bees would drastically affect the ecosystem.

The issue is very alarming. In fact, just last year, a survey conducted on behalf of the environmental group Friends of the Earth Canada suggested that about seven in 10 Canadians are very worried about the loss of the bee population. Nine out of 10 respondents expressed their belief that pesticides are the biggest threat to the survival of bees.

And the effects are showing. Over the last 10 years, beekeepers have been noticing a decline in the number of their colonies. They also observed one thing: the decline in bees was higher in colonies that live near corn or canola fields.

“We found that bees were exposed to neonicotinoids for most of the season, anywhere between three to four months on average. That was consistent across all of our study sites,” said Zayed. He recognized that while the level of pesticide exposure in all of their study sites was fairly low and not enough to kill a colony, it was very intense.

They also discovered that the pollen that they had gathered near the study sites didn’t come from corn but from other plants, plants that were not even present during the start of the growing season, during which time the pesticides were applied to the crops. “This indicates that neonicotinoids, which are water-soluble, spill over from agricultural fields into the surrounding environment, where are taken up by other plants that are very attractive to bees,” said Nadia Tsvetkov, a student at York University.

Because bees are vital to both plant and crop pollination, it is important to come up with ways to protect their species. Europe has called for a complete ban on neonicotinoids in 2013. Canada made the same move in 2015.

(Natural News) Residents of Wilmington, North Carolina want to know if the water they are drinking every day could possibly kill them.

Chemical conglomerate DuPont and its spinoff company Chemours’ manufacturing plants are located upstream from Wilmington – on a 2,100-acre property on the Cape Fear River in Fayeteville – where they produce GenX, a potentially cancer-causing chemical that is used to make Teflon.

A three-year study that was co-authored by North Carolina water utility Cape Fear Public Utility Authority calculated just how much GenX was present in Cape Fear’s waters. However, the study’s conclusions were never revealed to the public, even to Wilmington Mayor Bill Saffo, according to a report by CBS News‘ Jericka Duncan.

“We were alarmed. And we want to know how long that compound or that chemical had been dispersed into the Cape Fear River. And they told us since 1980. [This] needs to be looked at by Congress to make certain that we have safe drinking water in this country,” Mayor Saffo said.

DuPont had a history of manufacturing toxic chemicals. In 2005, DuPont paid the largest fine that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had received so far when it came to environmental violations – $16.5 million – for failing to report the dangerous effects to human health of a chemical called C8.

Just this February, DuPont and Chemours paid over $670 million to settle a class action lawsuit that was lodged against them due to the contamination of the water in the Ohio River Valley. (Related: DuPont sued multiple times as court-backed science panel finds chemical C8 used in Teflon is linked to cancer)

DuPont introduced GenX in 2009 to replace C8, which is used to make stain-resistant carpeting coatings and waterproof clothing, aside from Teflon. DuPont continued manufacturing GenX even though a report from The Intercept which was published in 2016 exposed GenX as a potential carcinogen as well as an agent that could potentially lead to reproductive issues.

Promises and commitments

Chemours said it would take necessary steps to get rid of GenX wastewater emissions from its Fayeteville site.

The chemical company said that based on a report that the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services released on Monday, June 12, there is very little presence of GenX in the waters of Cape River. It also claims that its Fayeteville plant had not impacted the state of the drinking water in the region. That being said, Chemours has said they are taking the necessary steps to avoid a repeat of the C8 situation.

However, a study that was published in Environmental Science & Technology Letters in 2016 revealed that the level of GenX in the drinking water of the Cape Fear Public Authority had an average of 631 parts per trillion (ppt). Study author Detley Knaffe said that the entire watershed – which provides drinking water for around 250,000 people – is very likely contaminated already.

A more recent report – done in 2017 – by a group of researchers in Sweden showed that GenX is even more harmful to human health than C8.

The EPA last year set the drinking water standard for C8 at 70 ppt in North Carolina. It has yet to do the same for the chemical GenX.

CNN retracts conspiracy hit piece after realizing it’s such FAKE NEWS that even CNN can’t stomach it

Earlier this year, President Trump took to Twitter and called the mainstream media “the enemy of the American people.” Needless to say, this statement was one hundred percent accurate, and perfectly summarized the political hostility that the majority of cable news networks have been participating in since the election. Among these networks is CNN, which is easily one of the most politically biased and hateful networks in existence. The majority of the so-called “journalists” that work for CNN aren’t journalists at all; rather, they are nothing more than political hacks that are hellbent on taking down the president of the United States.

In the most recent example of overwhelming liberal propaganda being pushed out across the airwaves by CNN, the left-leaning network published a story connecting Anthony Scaramucci, who served on Donald Trump’s transition team following the 2016 election, to a Russian investment fund. The story has since been retracted, and CNN was forced to apologize for ever publishing the blatantly false hit piece in the first place.

“On June 22, 2017, CNN.com published a story connecting Anthony Scaramucci with investigations into the Russian Direct Investment Fund,” said the statement released by the network. “That story did not meet CNN’s editorial standards and has been retracted. Links to the story have been disabled. CNN apologizes to Mr. Scaramucci.”

Given CNN’s track record of fake news and anti-Trump propaganda, it’s not much of a stretch to say that the only reason why the network apologized was because they got caught red handed. They knew that failing to retract the story would be a bad PR move, and so in the interest of saving their ratings (which were already poor to begin with), they decided to publicly apologize to Scaramucci and admit that they were in the wrong. Had there not been so much outrage and controversy surrounding the story, CNN likely would have allowed it to continue being spread across the Internet.

But the real issue here has to do with why CNN published this story in the first place. Regardless of the fact that they eventually apologized and retracted the hit piece, what was it that compelled them to publish such a blatantly inaccurate article to begin with? (RELATED: CNN credibility collapses under the weight of the most recent fake news scandal).

The answer, of course, is their deep, uncontrollable hatred for Donald Trump. All throughout the presidential election, congressional Democrats and the mainstream media saw Hillary Clinton as “the chosen one.” To them, there really wasn’t any competition because it was simply her turn to be president. When Donald Trump ended up emerging victorious, it not only threw the liberals into a tailspin, but it also allowed the American people to see the true colors of the progressive left. They are not “kind and compassionate;” they are vengeful and full of hate.

Most people probably remember the shameful and slanderous attack on the President that occurred earlier this year, when CNN essentially colluded with BuzzFeed to push a false 35-page dossier alleging, among other things, that Donald Trump has deep connections with Russian officials. Much like the recently retracted story from CNN, the dossier story was clearly nothing more than an attempt to dismantle the Trump administration and discredit the president of the United States.

President Trump was absolutely correct in saying that the mainstream media is the enemy of the American people. With networks like CNN and even others like MSNBC, CBS and NBC, the public is constantly being fed a never-ending stream of lies and misinformation, which, needless to say, is not healthy for any functioning society. The American people deserve the truth, and it has become blatantly obvious that with CNN, that is not going to happen anytime soon.

For America to survive, we must declare independence from Big Pharma’s failed medical monopoly

Although suddenly everyone is aware of the looming financial collapse of the State of Illinois, almost no one is aware of why it’s actually happening. And the lying mainstream media — purveyors of fake news — won’t dare tell you the real truth: Illinois is being bankrupted by Big Pharma and the failed “sick care” medical establishment.

With a current payables backlog of $15 billion it owes to contractors that include “sick care” providers, Illinois also owes $251 billion in future pension benefits that include health care coverage. That’s a quarter of a trillion dollars for a state that is so far beyond broke that even mainstream news organizations are calling its financial situation “catastrophic.”

On top of that, a recent court ruling demands the state now pay $586 million per month to catch up on all the unpaid Medicaid bills it owes doctors, hospitals, cancer clinics and drug companies. State comptroller Susana Mendoza says, “Friday’s ruling would cause her to likely have to cut payments to the state’s pension funds, state payroll or payments to local governments,” according to the Chicago Tribune. “As if the governor and legislators needed any more reason to compromise and settle on a comprehensive budget plan immediately, Friday’s ruling by the U.S. District Court takes the state’s finances from horrific to catastrophic,” said Mendoza.

Like all the other states, Illinois has flushed billions down the toilet to enrich Big Pharma’s failed “sick care” treatments

The real reason Illinois is going broke is because the health care system in America is technically a legal drug cartel … a profiteering monopoly that transfers economic wealth from the citizens to the pockets of drug companies.

A literal conspiracy across the FDA and state medical boards criminalizes natural medicine while pushing high-priced prescription drugs that cure nothing and only guarantee repeat business for the pharma drug cartels. The result is a massive, nationwide “wealth extraction” operation run by the drug companies, and Illinois is just the first of many states that will financially crumble under the burden of monopoly-priced medicine that fails to prevent disease in the first place.

Even as we’re watching Illinois implode under the financial burden of a failed health care system, almost no one is talking about the real source of the problem: The drug cartels and their monopoly over medicine. In the same way that Colombia was transformed into a “narco state” in the 1980s by the lucrative cocaine trade cocaine, today’s United States of America has collapsed into a “pharma state” where drug company interests dominate the politics.

To save America, we must declare independence from Big Pharma’s drug cartels

America spends almost one out of every four dollars of its GDP on “sick care” services. This is largely money that’s spent on a broken health care system dominated by Big Pharma’s toxic drugs that simply don’t work to prevent sickness and disease. This disastrous drug cartel serves only to transfer wealth from the population to the pockets of drug company shareholders and CEOs, and if America is to financially survive, it must reject this failed system of unaffordable, toxic medicine.

The FDA’s federally-enforced drug monopoly must end, and we as a nation must legalize natural medicine for everyone, including protecting doctors and health practitioners who wish to prescribe natural medicine to their patients (but will currently lose their medical licenses if they attempt such things).

The primary enforcer of the toxic pharmaceutical cartels that are bankrupting America — the FDA — must be gutted from top to bottom. The agency serves as nothing but a drug-pushing protection racket enforcer, targeting natural medicine manufacturers for destruction while colluding with drug companies to keep dangerous, costly prescription medications widely available even when they are killing hundreds of thousands of Americans each year. Thanks to the FDA, for example, prescription opioid deaths have now surpassed all gun-related deaths in America. The result is the acceleration toward bankruptcy at every level of our economy: Cities, states and even nations are facing imminent financial collapse because they’ve spent fortunes on monopoly-priced medications that have accomplished nothing other than enriching the Big Pharma drug cartel.

When a single state in America must now pay over half a billion dollars per month just to barely keep up with what it owes the medical system, you know something has gone terribly wrong and the system is unsustainable.

Big Pharma is a dangerous parasite on the U.S. economy and it will bankrupt everything if we don’t stop it. All the Republican talk about health care reform and “free market” solutions is just smoke and mirrors unless you address the pharma drug cartels and the FDA-enforced monopoly that criminalizes natural medicine, a safe, affordable and highly effective alternative to toxic prescription medications.

In fact, I’ll make a bold prediction here: Any state or nation that does not free itself from the economic death grip of the pharma drug cartels will eventually face financial collapse. Paying more and more money to a monopoly-protected corporate monstrosity that sells toxic chemicals to sick people is not merely unsustainable, it is stupid beyond belief. Yet this remains the default plan of both Republicans and Democrats in Washington, nearly all of whom are prostitutes for the pharmaceutical industry.

Listen to my podcast videos to learn more details about why the Big Pharma drug cartels are so dangerous to America:

STAND! – American Freedom Event announced for July 15th in Las Vegas, to free the political prisoners in the USA, jailed under the Obama regime

If there’s one thing that the Obama era taught us, it’s that defending liberty is no easy task. All throughout this country, there exists a movement to fundamentally transform that United States of America and destabilize our position on the global stage. What’s worse is that the progressives never stop. Even though Donald Trump defeated Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton last November, and even though Republicans currently control both chambers of Congress, tyranny and the principles of big government continue to plague our country, as seen in Hollywood, the mainstream media, and on nearly every college campus from coast to coast.

Ronald Reagan once said that “Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn’t pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same.” Reagan’s words are just as true today as they were decades ago – if we wish to remain a country that is free from tyranny and political oppression, we must take a stand.

On July 15, you can become part of American history by attending the “Stand” American freedom event at the Rainbow Gardens in Las Vegas, Nevada. The event will benefit those who have been placed behind bars for standing up for our God-given rights and our longstanding commitment to individual liberty. As patriots, it is our duty to let these freedom fighters know that we have their backs, and that even if our government makes them out to be political criminals, we the people will stand with them.

One such freedom fighter is none other than Ammon Bundy, the Oregon protester who was arrested last January for occupying the headquarters of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge as part of a larger battle over public land in the West. Authorities also arrested Ammon’s brother Ryan Bundy, Brian Cavalier, Shawna Cox, and Ryan Payne, who were all taken into custody during a traffic stop on U.S. Highway 395. (RELATED: Was the armed theft and cattle siege from the Bundy ranch really about fracking?)

Bundy and his group, which they refer to as Citizens for Constitutional Freedom, have fought hard against what they consider to be extreme federal land restrictions and argue that these government-controlled regions should be handed over to local authorities. Currently, the federal government has authority over nearly half of all land in the West.

Another one of these freedom fighters that the “Stand” event will benefit is journalist and conservative radio host Peter Santilli, who was arrested not long after he began live streaming reports of Ammon Bundy’s arrest on YouTube. Santilli’s colleagues initially wrote on a Facebook page associated with the conservative journalist that Santilli was arrested at a roadblock in Oregon. They later updated the report, stating: “Pete Santilli was arrested after pleading with the FBI to allow him to set up a convoy to save the women and children in the refuge,” referring to the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge that was being occupied by the Bundy family.

If you would like to stand up for these patriots and many others across the country who have made great sacrifices for the preservation of our liberty, consider attending #STAND ‘The Ultimate Event for American Freedom” on July 15 at 7 pm PST at Rainbow Gardens in Las Vegas. Speakers will include Roger Stone, Adam Kokesh and Sean Stone, with a special presentation from the Health Ranger, Mike Adams. Tickets can be purchased for just $12 on the group’s PayPal account page. VIP tickets are also available, which will give you the opportunity to shake hands with some of the event’s speakers and organizers.

Be a part of American history and stand up for America’s jailed freedom fighters by attending this special event in Las Vegas. Tickets will sell out fast, so be sure to purchase now while they’re available.

Writer for Bill Nye’s transgender-pushing Netflix show celebrates shooting deaths of “old ass conservative white men”

A standup comedian who also reportedly works on the writing staff of the Netflix series Bill Nye Saves the World apparently seems to think that it’s okay for some non-politically correct people to die in order to bring the gun control issue to the forefront.

In mid-June, Marcella Arguello tweeted that “if a few old ass conservative white men have to die in order to get the gun control issue discussed then I’m willing to take that risk.”

The now-deleted tweet (embedded below) apparently was a form of social commentary after the shooting of U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, who is only 52 years old.

On June 14, a Bernie Sanders supporter opened fire at an Alexandria, Va., baseball field, seriously wounding Scalise. Two brave Capitol police officers assigned to Scalise, a member of the House leadership team, neutralized the gunman, thereby preventing what could have been a mass casualty situation, given the large group of GOP lawmakers and staffers present for the baseball practice. Fortunately, after multiple surgeries, Scalise is on the road to recovery.

In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Natural News founder Mike Adams opined that the mainstream, or “fake stream,” media has elevated otherwise legitimate political disagreements (and the lack of legislative progress from both Republicans and Democrats in Congress is a cause for concern) to a whole new disturbing level.

It’s also clear that the shooter specifically targeted a Republican softball game, obviously driven to hatred and rage by the venomous narratives of the left-wing media and its Trump-hating propagandists

Sadly, the Trump-hating media and entertainment industry do not seem to have changed their ways since the attack, however.

Separately, if you follow the rhetoric of social justice warriors who preach inclusion and tolerance as part of their progressive movement, you’re aware that they tend to blame many of the shortcomings of our country on white privilege and white males in particular. Yet the left in America has traditionally been on the leading edge of civil rights, and under federal and state civil rights laws, discrimination on the basis of race, or gender, or age is illegal.

The TruthRevolt website summed up the message that seems to be conveyed in the Nye-staffer’s tweet.

For the left, white male conservatives are expendable if their deaths hasten a Progressive agenda, and the left is perfectly happy to admit it. Of course, white female conservatives too are expendable because the left doesn’t consider them feminists or even real women, just as black conservatives are not considered “really black.” So basically, all conservatives, but especially “old ass white” males, can die as long as a Progressive aim is furthered.

On another note, as widely reported (and maybe it was just about generating buzz), the season finale of Bill Nye Saves the World featured a cringe-worthy musical number that pushed transgenderism. The artist formerly known as the science guy is also all-in for global warming and genetically modified food, which gives saving the world a new meaning. Netflix has renewed the show for a second season. (RELATED: Read more about corporate propaganda at FakeScience.news.).

School freaks out after Conservative titles make the summer reading list

When it comes to politics, it’s fair to say that most millennials are completely lost. They blithely embrace politicians like Bernie Sanders who are burying them in debt, reject free market principles despite the fact that the capitalist system has lifted more people out of poverty than any other, and believe that gender is defined by how one feels on the inside rather than what’s between their legs. Even worse, most young people reject the United States Constitution and falsely believe that America’s founding consisted of nothing but racism and slavery.

The reason why they are so misinformed is twofold: One, their heads are constantly being filled with left wing propaganda inside the classroom, and two, they are never taught about the benefits of conservatism, small government and the free market. They are not receiving a full, well-rounded education, and they are perfectly fine with that.

At Spanish Fort High School in Alabama, a teacher by the name of Gene Ponder is now facing backlash for a summer reading list he gave to students in his Advanced Placement Government/Economics class. Ponder, who ran for lieutenant governor of Alabama back in 2010 as a republican, asked students to pick one book out of 31 on a list of mostly conservative books, including Liberty and Tyranny by Mark Levin and Liberalism is a Mental Disorder: Savage Solutions by Michael Savage. Other authors that made the reading list included Ronald Reagan, Thomas Sowell, Ron Paul, Ann Coulter, and other like-minded people.

Even though the majority of the reading list has a blatant conservative slant, some of the books were more liberal, such as SuperFreakonomics by Steven Levin and Stephen Dubner. But despite this, and despite the fact that students had the ability to choose which book they wanted to read, many people still were not happy.

Shannon Cauley, the President of the Baldwin County Board of Education, told Gulf Coast News Today that she first learned about the reading list through social media and then made the decision to notify the superintendent.

“As a courtesy, the school principal called to let me know that the list had been removed and assignment canceled,” Cauley said on Facebook. “He’ll be sending an email to all senior students/parents to notify them that there will be no summer reading assignments for this AP government class.”

Superintendent Eddie Tyler later confirmed, “The list has been removed by the teacher,” adding, “I expect all employees to follow our processes, procedures and policies” regarding receiving approval for reading lists before sending them out to students.

There is no denying the fact that the reading list included mostly books that were written from a conservative perspective. However, given the amount of liberal indoctrination that routinely goes on inside of the classroom, one could argue that this list is not only necessary, but also long overdue.

Teen unemployment rate hits a whopping 14%, we list two reasons why this might be so

Latest figures reflect conflicting views on the American economy. New, seasonally-adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) shows that while job opportunities in the U.S. have increased since the Trump administration, the rate of teen employment has dipped to a worrisome 14 percent. This may not seem so bad compared to 2009, where 27 percent of teens were without a job, but it does speak of an underlying and potentially dangerous trend in summer jobs or seasonal work.

In an analysis posted on Bloomberg.com, a recent CareerBuilder survey of 2,587 employers found that 41 percent of them were planning on hiring seasonal or contractual workers for the summer. This is a 29 percent increase from last year. Yet teen employment remained down. The discrepancy may, the Bloomberg article stated, lie in the fact that unemployment numbers spoke of those who were actively looking for a job. It did not take into account teenagers who were not seeking to be employed — and apparently, many American teens aren’t.

A quick look into teen employment over the last 30 years show a distinct pattern. When the economic recession hit in the early 1990s, financial analysts expected a massive dip in teen employment. However, as the American economy recovered, teen labor did not. In fact, the participation rate of 16- to 19-year-olds has steadily declined since the early 2000s.

Two theories have been proposed as to why this might be so.

Competition is fierce

Whether by choice or necessity, more older Americans are opting to stay in the workforce. According to an article on Telegraph.co.uk, one in five Americans aged 65 and older are still working — the highest rate since 1985. We can look at the sunny side of this and point to the longer life expectancy of people and employees feeling more engaged with their work, but analysts say that the reason most people choose to work longer is merely because they have to. In the same article, it was noted that a quarter of employees aged 55 and older do not have the necessary savings to retire properly; questioned participants reported having less than $10,000 in combined investments and savings. With such a small nest egg, nearly a third of workers in this age group said that they expect to work until they are at least 70, if they retire at all. Older workers also recognized that they may be replaced for a younger worker, making them less willing to give up their job — even for a season.

Another factor to take note of is the considerable impact low-skilled immigration has on the youth labor market. A 2012 study with the same title suggested that the increased competition offered by immigrants has caused the decline of teen employment. Take this from the employer’s point of view: Even if these adult immigrants are less educated and may have potential language difficulties, they can be paid less, work more hours, and could — in time — become a full-fledged employee given proper training. Unlike with American teens who expect quite a lot and can only work for a summer, the cost-expense benefit is not that appealing. The views offered in the study though have yet to be empirically validated so these assumptions should be taken with a grain of salt.

More students are choosing to study

Incidentally, one reason why teenagers are not working, or choosing to apply for a summer job, could be because they are deciding instead to study. Another Bureau of Labor Statistics analysis revealed that the cooling of the teen labor force participation can be linked to the increased school workload students have. School districts have lengthened both the school day and academic year in only just the last few decades. Students are using their summers not only to catch up on their school work but to enroll in enrichment courses and work on their college credits. BLS data showed that more than two in five 16- to 19-year-old were enrolled in school over the summer. This is four times as many as there were enrolled in 1985. It has been suggested that parents are also pushing their children to take more advanced placement (AP) classes to get a leg up in school and in potential employment when these teens are of actual working age.

Still, a recent National Bureau of Economic Research study concluded that this single-mindedness in education can prevent teenagers from benefiting from the social and emotional growth summer jobs can offer them. If anything, researchers of the study said that teens who work for a summer or two “[learn how] to better avoid or manage conflict.”

(Natural News) There is a reason that people have learned reading, writing and arithmetic in generally the same way over the years, and that’s because the tried-and-true traditional methods work. That’s why many people wondered what the real agenda of the Common Core national standards were when the Obama administration started pushing for it so relentlessly. This ridiculous set of educational standards has left many students and parents baffled and frustrated, and it’s believed to be a key reason that American kids are lagging behind other nations in academic performance. What would happen if we got rid of it entirely? If the results gained by one Florida school are any indication, we would likely all be much better off.

Mason Classical Academy, a charter school in Naples, Florida, prides itself on providing a classical education, which it believes brings about “superior educational results” – and leading the county in English Language Arts is proof they’re on the right track.

They have rejected the backward approach of Common Core, which sees kids memorize entire words in kindergarten before later being introduced to phonics once they are in elementary school. By that point, their brains are already used to whole words, which makes grasping the concept of phonics and applying it far more difficult than it needs to be.

What does the classical approach embraced by the Academy entail? According to their website, language-focused learning based on written and spoken words makes the brain work harder to convert words into concepts, while image-based approaches encourage passivity. The time-tested approach of phonics is very likely the reason you are able to read this article in the first place, and it’s hard to imagine why anyone would consider it inadequate.

Thanks to the classical approach of phonics, an impressive 90 percent of the third-grade students at Mason Classical Academy were proficient in English Language Arts, compared to just 58 percent in the county overall, most of whom rely on Common Core. In fact, the MCA third-graders were in Florida’s top two percent, while fifth graders from the academy ranked in the state’s top one percent.

These students look even better when you compare them to California, where the state average is just 43 percent proficiency among third graders. Even worse, six public schools in Baltimore do not have a single student who is proficient in either English Language Arts or math. It’s almost like students are being set up to fail.

Of course, not everyone is happy about this school’s success. Common Core proponents are panicking because these results expose the system for the fraud that it is. The school has been on the receiving end of criticism from everyone from the district’s superintendent to the local news outlet Naples Daily News, according to The Freedom Project.

Why is Common Core setting students up to fail?

Among the many criticisms of Common Core is the fact that it is so strongly focused on test results and teachers are so worried about losing their jobs if their students don’t perform that kids are forced into busywork, missing out on the valuable opportunity to develop social skills and boost their well-being through recess outdoors. It also stifles creativity and stresses children out, which can adversely affect their emotional and physical health.

One of its defining characteristics is the way it “dumbs down” many concepts and has students take too many steps to reach conclusions that are obvious to those of us who were schooled the traditional way.

For example, many people were outraged when a second-grade student’s homework went viral after a correct math answer was marked wrong by the teacher because it wasn’t “friendly.” When asked to solve 530-270, the student arrives at the right answer by subtracting the way most of us were taught in school. Although the student got the right answer, his teacher wanted him to solve it by adding 30 to both numbers so the problem would then be 560-300. There are countless other examples of homework just like this one that illustrate how Common Core is unnecessarily confusing and focused on all the wrong things.

(Natural News) Amazon looks set to take over Whole Foods, and while some people think the internet retail giant could use its technological prowess to improve the grocery store’s services, there is one group that is viewing the change with much less optimism: Whole Foods cashiers and other employees.

It is believed that Amazon wants to position the chain to compete with stores like Walmart and target middle- to lower-income consumers, and one of the big ways they could bring prices down is by minimizing labor.

Amazon made waves with its Amazon Go store last year, which removed cashiers from the equation entirely. Instead, technology monitored customers and recorded their purchases, charging them automatically as they left the store with carts full of food. While Amazon has said this approach isn’t planned for Whole Foods, the internet firm is known for operating at razor-thin margins, which means that they probably would not be opposed to handing a few employees their walking papers.

However, holding onto their jobs might not be the stroke of good luck it appears if the way Amazon treats its current employees is any indication. Workers have filed several lawsuits over their wages in the past few years, which are so low that distribution center employees in some of its locations live in homeless shelters. Amazon’s harsh work culture has been described by employees as a “soul-crushing experience,” where workers are urged to tear each other’s ideas apart in meetings and are berated via text at all hours for not answering late-night work-related emails.

According to an unflattering profile in the New York Times, the environment at Amazon is cut-throat and employees are encouraged to turn on one another. Some workers complained of being pushed out or evaluated unfairly following personal crises like miscarriages or illness instead of being allowed some time to recover. The workplace is so demanding that a popular saying there is “Amazon is where overachievers go to feel bad about themselves.”

Workers crying every day, subjected to extreme heat

A former book marketer for the firm, Bo Olson, told The Times that he saw nearly every person he worked with cry at their desk at least once, and that grown men crying as they left conference rooms was a common sight there. The company also came under fire when employees in a Pennsylvania warehouse were forced to work in temperatures that exceeded 100 degrees while ambulances waited outside to take them away as they fell; they only installed air conditioning after being outed for this practice by a local newspaper.

There are likely many more stories of the type of corporate environment Whole Foods workers might expect when Amazon takes the helm, but the extensive confidentiality agreements that even low-level workers must sign means many are understandably reluctant to come forward.

Who wins in Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods?

The fate of Whole Foods employees is just one concerning aspect of this deal. There’s also the fact that Amazon and Whole Foods both sell foods that are contaminated with heavy metals. Making matters worse, Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post. That publication’s fondness for supporting Monsanto makes it seem likely that Whole Foods could choose to abandon its promise to label the GMO status of all the food it sells by next year. This move does not seem like a positive one for workers or customers of Whole Foods. The only winner in this deal, it appears, is Amazon itself.

(Natural News) Even though it spends more per pupil than every other large school district in the country save for two, Baltimore City Public Schools is failing to teach students even the basics they need to get by in life. Reports indicate that at least six schools in the district failed this past year to produce even one single student who was proficient in either English or math.

An investigation by Project Baltimore found that five high schools and one middle school in the district should pretty much be shut down at this point because they’re serving no useful purpose whatsoever. Booker T. Washington Middle School, Frederick Douglass High School, Achievement Academy at Harbor City, New Era Academy, Excel Academy at Francis M. Wood High, and New Hope Academy all failed to pass even just one student that met the minimum requirements for exceptional proficiency in either of the two subjects.

Frederick Douglass High School had the worst results out of all six schools. With 185 students in total, a shocking 165 of them achieved a 1/5 on the proficiency scale, with 1 indicating that these students in no way met proficiency expectations. Nineteen students partially met expectations ranking at 2/5, but were still considered to be not proficient. Only one student scored a 3/5 for “approaching expectations,” though even this one was dubbed not proficient. Not a single student at Frederick Douglass achieved a 4/5 or a 5/5, which would have put them in the proficient category.

Amazingly enough, some of these non-proficient students are still on track to graduate. According to Freedom Project, this is because of “radically dumbed-down exams linked to Common Core,” a controversial curriculum approach that in many ways deforms traditional mathematics and corrupts children’s minds.

Baltimore school officials: It’s not our fault, even though we’re teaching kids common core and other educational quackery

What this investigation reveals is the pressing need for major reforms within the government school systems of our country. They spend gobs of taxpayer dollars – in this case, a whopping $16,000 per student, ranking in as the third highest spending district in the country – and yet they’re utterly failing to teach our children what they need to know to get by in life.

And yet, they routinely demand more money in spite of all this, including in Baltimore where district officials refuse to even admit that they should take any blame for the dismal success rate amongst its students. Speaking to the media, Baltimore City Schools Executive Director of Teaching and Learning, Janise Lane, for instance, expressed adamant opposition to the notion that the problem stems from anywhere other than the students themselves.

“I wouldn’t say the school district is at fault,” she stated.

Made up of mostly poor, minority children, Baltimore’s public schools are, indeed, affected by other problems besides just those that occur in the classroom. Many of the students who attend school there come from broken families without fathers, and are victims of what one news outlet describes as “dumbed-down indoctrination program[s] masquerading as ‘education.'” This includes learning things like “whole word” and “sight words” instead of traditional phonics.

“By turning these otherwise healthy children into functional illiterates with quackery first exposed more than 100 years ago, the government schools set the stage for a lifetime of failure, dependency, and deception,” writes Alex Newman for Freedom Project.

“Illiteracy prevents these children from going out and learning on their own – no reading of the Bible, the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, or anything else. And the results of that are predictable, too: violence, broken families, drugs, gangs, hatred, support for government dependence, and more.”

(Natural News) Former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg thinks that cannabis should be legalized across the United Kingdom. He contends that legalization will bring in $1 billion in annual tax revenue while depriving criminal gangs of a major revenue source. He also believes a standard, regulated product would prevent purchases of high THC skunk strains that are dominating the black market.

Prohibition of cannabis sativa around the world has resulted in mass incarceration, widespread paranoia between people and law enforcement, loss of privacy and property, unnecessary violence and death. Yet more people smoke the plant than ever before. The latest data estimates that two million people in England and Wales smoked cannabis in 2016. Prohibition of this plant has only helped finance criminal drug gangs while wasting valuable court system time and jail cells. Why are non-violent people being locked up over this? In the U.K., anyone caught in possession of cannabis could face up to five years in prison. Dealers can face 14 years in prison. All this racketeering could be put to an end with legalization. Isn’t it time to accept this plant as part of who we are and end all the human separation?

Prohibition has also encouraged growers to breed the cannabidiol (CBD) out of the plant, while maximizing the tetrehydrocannabinol (THC) content (the psychoactive part of the plant). This has led users to become dependent on the high, while missing out the benefits of the plant.

Opponents to legalization fear that legalization sends the wrong message about drug use. Mr. Clegg argues that legalization would help remove super strength “skunk” TCH strains from the streets. Making cannabis legal would improve public health, he contends. If cannabis was sold over the counter, then criminal gangs would no longer be able to profit from illegal sales, either.

Mr. Clegg asserts, “The opponents of regulation should ask themselves this: what other public health problem do we contract out entirely to organized criminals? Instead of looking for real solutions, they expect us to believe that the criminal law will prevail, despite no evidence that this approach has ever worked anywhere in the world.”

Mr. Clegg takes it a step further and proposes that the U.K. sell the cannabis in standardized, plain packaging. This would do two things. First, it would lessen demand and make getting high less enticing. Second, it would ensure that users aren’t getting a “skunk” strain, bred just for the high. Britain’s illegal drug market is now saturated with “skunk” cannabis strains. Figures estimate that skunk varieties make up 80 percent of the black market. The demand for and dependence on this highly modified form would dissipate if standardized cannabis extracts were made available over the counter. The standard wouldn’t contain tobacco, additives or other drugs. Legalization and proper regulation could clean up the underground cannabis market, helping rid high THC strains and synthetic forms that are tied to mental health issues. (Related: Read more news on health freedom at HealthFreedom.news.)

“Regulation would allow us to control the product, capping maximum strength and requiring that all varieties contain CBD,” says Mr. Clegg. “Labeling requirements would end the lottery where cannabis users have no idea what they are buying.” King’s College London experts said in 2015 that the most potent forms are responsible for new cases of psychotic mental illness. Legalization would end the guesswork of what people are really smoking and could help put an end to the “reefer madness.”

People everywhere should be free to enjoy their time and connect with nature how they deem fit. Cannabis possesses many healing virtues, and if legalized, could dramatically improve public health. (Related: Learn more about the healing virtues of this sacred plant at CannabisCures.News.)

(Natural News) For consciousness researcher Tom Campbell, our world is not as is appears to be. Rather than a concrete, objective environment, Campbell maintains that the world is actually a ‘virtual reality’ and a simulation – more along the lines of a video game. We often hear that things are ‘not the way they appear’ – right? Well, for many physicists the answer has just gotten much clearer.

Discover the scientific truth about the nature of consciousness, and its role in creating reality. On the next NaturalHealth365 Talk Hour, Jonathan Landsman and physicist Tom Campbell explore a complete theory of consciousness – and the purpose of life itself. If you’ve ever wondered “WHY are we here? What is reality?” – then, you’ll want to join us for this extraordinary program – and a journey of personal and scientific discovery.

All reality is based on consciousness

Campbell strives to address many of the unanswered questions existing in science today, and to explore our purpose and connection to a larger reality – what he calls the “Big Picture.”

According to Campbell, the physical universe is generated by an intelligent probability-based simulation – meaning it isn’t “matter-based.” In fact, Campbell maintains that there are multiple Virtual Reality frames within which we exist simultaneously. And this concept – which Campbell calls a paradigm shift – is gaining acceptance in the area of digital physics and quantum mechanics.

Although it echoes some of the ancient beliefs articulated by mystics, wise men and shamans, Campbell says his theory can be scientifically verified through his experiments.

Campbell’s new paradigm allows for paranormal experiences – including precognition, out of body experiences, time travel and near death experiences – to be perceived as normal. Because our consciousness is already outside the body, we don’t need to get out of the body – we need to get into our consciousness, Campbell notes.

Don’t miss the next NaturalHealth365 Talk Hour, to discover the true meaning of life and how our thoughts can alter our physical reality.

Cooperation, passion and love are needed for evolution

Quantum mechanical experiments suggest that we live in a computed reality – and our consciousness is the computer. “At some point,” says Campbell, “consciousness became self-aware.”

But, if our understanding remains fragmented by our limiting beliefs, our reality will be limited as well.

People want the world to be fact-based, and materialism to be the “right” theory of existence, Campbell acknowledges. But he says this state of mind may be temporary – that materialism is a “phase” that people are currently going through.

In reality, (no pun intended) the whole point of our existence, says Campbell, is love.

His belief is that reality is a training system – or “trainer” – the point of which is to help us to “grow up and turn into love. We are here to become love.”

If you’re looking for an entirely NEW (and healthier) perspective on life and your health – you’ll want to join us on the next NaturalHealth365 Talk Hour with physicist Tom Campbell.

This week’s guest: Tom Campbell, physicist and author

Discover the true power of the mind and how to dramatically improve the quality of your life – Sun. Jun. 4

Thomas Campbell, physicist, consciousness researcher, author and international lecturer, has been researching altered states of consciousness with Bob Monroe since the 1970s – when Campbell designed experiments at Monroe Laboratories.

He is the author of “My Big TOE,” a trilogy of books designed to reveal Campbell’s “Theory of Everything,” and bridge metaphysics and physics with scientific understanding. Known as the “TC physicist” in Bob Monroe’s second book, Campbell offers many of this experiments as a way of explaining the true nature of reality.

(Natural News) It’s sad, but with each passing year, America is becoming an increasingly godless country. According to the Pew Research Center, the number of U.S. adults who say that they believe in God has decreased from 92 percent to 89 percent since the year 2007. Furthermore, the number of Americans who say they are “absolutely certain” that God exists has dropped from 71 percent in 2007 down to 63 percent in 2014. While there are a number of possible explanations for this trend, perhaps the most obvious is the idea that Americans are beginning to replace God with science. The creation of the universe wasn’t the work of a higher power; it was the result of the big bang. God didn’t create humans; each and every one of us evolved from apes. This new, progressive way of thinking really only began a couple of decades ago.

What’s worse is that often times, people who do believe in God are criticized, mocked, and painted as societal outcasts. A recent study conducted by Northwestern University in Illinois found that people who suffer from brain injuries are more likely to become religious fundamentalists, suggesting that those who have a strong belief in God have something mentally wrong with them.

The researchers found that damage to the prefrontal cortex, which is the area of the brain that is responsible for functions like planning and perception, impaired peoples’ ability to evaluate and reflect upon their own religious beliefs in comparison to the beliefs of others.

In order to arrive at these results, researchers examined 119 people who had suffered brain injuries during the Vietnam War, as well as 30 others whose brains were fully intact and functioning properly. The participants were asked to respond to certain statements, such as “To lead the best, most meaningful life, one must belong to the one, true religion.” They found that veterans who had experienced injuries in the prefrontal cortex region of the brain had higher levels of religious fundamentalism than those whose brains were not damaged (RELATED: Read about the discovery of the God Module inside of the human brain).

Jordan Grafman, who co-authored the study, explained to the PsyPost, “Human beliefs, and in this case religious beliefs, are one of the cognitive and social knowledge stores that distinguish us from other species.” Dr. Grafman went on to say, “While religious and other beliefs can be studied selectively and independently from other cognitive and social processes, their dependence upon, and interaction with, other brain functions will be an important area of research in the coming decades.”

But while the big takeaway from this particular study seems to have been that there is supposedly a connection between brain injuries and religious fundamentalism, a separate study paints an entirely different picture.

A Pew Research study conducted late last year found that both Jews and Christians have more years of education than atheists, suggesting that the generally accepted idea that atheists are more intelligent than believers may not be entirely true. The study found that Jews receive an average of 13.4 years of formal education, Christians receive 9.3 years of education, and people who aren’t affiliated with a religion get an average of 8.8 years of education.

Furthermore, yet another study done by the Austin Institute for the Study of Family and Culture found that religious people tend to be much happier than those who do not practice any religion at all. 45 percent of those who attend religious services on a weekly basis describe themselves as “very happy,” compared to just 28 percent of people who never attend. On the flipside, the study found that those who never attend any religious services were twice as likely to describe themselves as “very unhappy” than those who attend services weekly.

(Natural News) Think the secret to inner peace lies in meditation? If you’re a man, think again. In a new study by researchers from Brown University, the team found that practicing mindfulness meditation does wonders for women while doing the opposite for men, reported the DailyMail.co.uk. Mindfulness meditation, wrote the researchers, is the practice of “intentionally and non-judgmentally directing one’s attention to the present moment, often by focusing on a particular salient sensation, such as one’s breath.”

Although touted as a way to treat depression and anxiety, the researchers noted that there have been no studies to investigate the effects of mindfulness meditation across genders. The researchers used this as the springboard for their study, which involved 77 Brown University undergraduates who took a 12-week course that focused on mindfulness training. The components of the course included papers, tests, presentations, weekly seminars, and three hour-long meditation sessions. The meditation sessions incorporated “approximately 30 min of a specific contemplative practice from Buddhist or Daoist traditions.”

During the study, each student engaged in an average of over 41 hours of meditation during class and outside of it. The students were also asked to fill out questionnaires at the beginning and at the end of the class.

By the end of the study, researchers were presented with surprising results. “Both women and men improved significantly in most measures,” the researchers wrote. The practical results were more varied, however. Researchers found a discrepancy between the groups: “Our results suggest that women benefited more from school-based mindfulness training than men.” (Related: Meditation linked to happiness and positive behavior).

The difference lay in how men and women usually react to negative emotions and situations. In the study, published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, the team indicated that women tend to “ruminate” and immerse themselves in “self-critical behavior”, which made the practice of mindful meditation better for the 36 female students. By contrast, men “’externalize’ by distracting themselves or engaging the environment”, meaning that mindful meditation was more stressful an experience for the 41 male students.

Doctor Willoughby B. Britton, one of the co-authors, went on to declare that mindfulness meditation was fitting for those who were already willing to confront or expose themselves to difficult or negative feelings. For those who were suddenly forced to expose themselves to those feelings, mindfulness meditation was “counterproductive”. The researchers concluded their study by stating, “Women benefit more by demonstrating decreased negative affect and improved mindfulness and self-compassion skills. Conversely, men did not show improvements in negative affect, nor did improvements in mindfulness and self-compassion translate to improved affect as it did in women.”

In a statement to the DailyMail.co.uk, Britton said: “While facing one’s difficulties and feeling one’s emotions may seem to be universally beneficial, it does not take into account that there may be different cultural expectations for men and women around emotionality.”

If further research can support their hypothesis, then the findings of this study may become vital to designers of mindfulness courses, as well as mindfulness researchers.

So if mindfulness meditation won’t work on men, what can? In their study, the researchers suggested more “active methods of mindfulness training”, citing yoga or Tai Chi as possible options since these were thought of as more suitable to the coping strategies typically used by men. The team also noted that previous research has shown the efficacy of physical activity on the stress reduction of men and women with greater masculinity ratings.

New research suggests that some children who have been diagnosed as falling on the autism spectrum may actually possess telepathic and psychic abilities that set their unusual behavior apart from that of others. These “savants,” as some experts are calling them, may or may not have the capacity to demonstrate these abilities in a visible way, but what’s going on inside their heads is believed to tell a much more interesting story about the unique “super” abilities that science increasingly suggests they quietly possess.

While it was formerly believed that autistic children who are unable to communicate the same way as other children are somehow lacking in cognition and verbal function, some of the latest science suggests that they simply have a different “skill set,” so to speak. Their brains are not only fully functional, in other words, but they may also have greater mental abilities than the average person, potentially including the ability to communicate without words.

Such research is often ridiculed by those in the mainstream as lacking credibility, but paraphysical evidence suggests that this psychic and telepathic phenomenon amongs autistic individuals is very real. Statistics out of the University of California, Irvine (UCI) published back in 1999, for instance, show that paraphysical phenomena are more verifiable than evidence showing that taking a daily dose of aspirin can help prevent a heart attack.

One of the areas where autistic “savants” shine rather brightly is in the math department. While the average person would require a calculator or computer to perform and advanced equation, for example, an autistic savant might be able to perform it in his or her head without assistance. This is just one example among many where autistic savants appear to excel in ways beyond everyday abilities.

“Some savants are able to perform extreme mathematical calculations in their head, similar to a calculator or computer, and others have remarkable artistic ability spanning across a variety of subjects,” Arjun Walia writes for Collective-Evolution.com. “The list of abilities seen in savants is long, and one ability that could one day be added to that list is telepathy.”

In many cases, autistic children are overachievers compared to ‘regular’ children

Dr. Diane Powell, M.D., a practicing neuropsychiatrist with an extensive resume of experience in this particular field, has been studying human consciousness for many decades, particularly in autistic persons and other individuals who possess special abilities. Dr. Powell has worked with non-verbal autistic children and says that strong evidence exists for their telepathic abilities.

In one particular test, the results of which Dr. Powell presented before an audience of experts several years back, an autistic child named Haley was presented with a series of mathematical equations. She was told to select various numbers and match them on a screen, for which she achieved a 100 percent hit rate.

What makes this experiment particularly intriguing is the fact that “regular” children in another test group achieved only a 90 percent hit rate, on average, demonstrating the unique ability of Haley, and presumably other non-verbal autistic children like her, to overachieve mentally when given the opportunity to do so.

Other experiments conducted over the years have shown that autistic children function beyond the normal binary systems that we can observe physically using traditional methods. Their thoughts, dreams, and methods of silent communication were studied as part of an experiment involving a “telepathic sender” and a “telepathic receiver,” revealing further the existence of a paranormal, non-physical world that modern science is only just beginning to tap and understand on a deeper level.

(Natural News) In June, 2014, as reported by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent group of 250 Catholic priests, collectively known as the International Association of Exorcists (IAE), was officially recognized by the Vatican as a “private juridical personality.” This decree meant that the IAE members – who at the time were residents from 30 nations – could continue to perform exorcisms, although not in the “name of the Catholic church.” Though not fully sanctioned by the Vatican, this recognition brought accountability to the IAE, as the Catholic church does have very precise rituals and rules concerning exorcism which, for the protection of all involved, must be perfectly adhered to.

One caveat to the process is that the demonic possession must be real, and “not some kind of emotional of psychiatric disturbance,” like a psychosis. That’s a question that Father Francisco Lopez Sedano, the “national coordinator emeritus of exorcism for the Archdiocese of Mexico” has faced many times.

This 80 year-old priest, as reported by the Catholic News Agency, has been exorcising demons for forty years. He’s seen individuals bark, scream, take the form of a snake wiggling on the ground, demonstrate supernatural strength, and exhibit disease symptoms that their physicians say don’t exist. These are not due to a psychiatric meltdown, according to Fr. Sedano, but activities and “injuries outside the control of clinical medicine.” In his four decades of practice, Fr. Sedano claims to have exorcised demonic forces 6000 times. He believes his work is a divine calling, and is Biblically demanded:

“The three mandates are to carry the word of God, heal the sick, and cast out demons.”

Fr. Sedano is not afraid of these encounters, and looks to Jesus, whose Hebrew name is Yahshua, as his model. For example, Yahshua commanded unclean spirits to come out of a lunatic bound with chains. He also had the authority to command a group of demons named Legion to leave a man and enter into a herd of swine. These are just two examples that Fr. Sedano takes to heart.

The devil, says Fr. Sedano, is a person who enters people “because they allow him too.” He states it is possible for these unseen forces to cause hate, distrust, desperation, or “anything negative.” A door to demonic possession can be opened, he warns, if one engages in witchcraft, speaking to the dead, astrology, magic, sorcery, any superstition practice and/or divination. (RELATED: See similar themed news at Prophecy.news)

According to Fellowshipoftheminds.com, as of July, 2016, there were 50 members of the IAE residing in the United States, and the need for their services is increasing. Board-certified psychiatrist Richard Gallagher, M.D., who is a professor of clinical psychiatry at New York Medical College, has done a few hundred consultations to help pastors, priests, and other clergy members try to “filter episodes of mental illness,” which Gallagher says is the cause of most cases from, “literally, the devil’s work.” He is convinced that there are cases in which he has seen up close evidence that there is “no other explanation” other than demonic possession. (Follow more news of the unexplained at Unexplained.news)

Whether it is the work of consultation with exorcists, or doing the actual work of a deliverer, both Fr. Sedano and Dr. Gallagher share an important motive in common. They do not want to mock or shame a person who may be suffering an unseen or misunderstood malady. Dr. Gallagher sums it up this way:

“For any person of science or faith, it should be impossible to turn one’s back on a tormented soul.”

Mainstream media now using the term “vaccine” to mean an injection of DNA-altering viruses that invade your cells and re-write your genetic code

If a doctor approached you with a needle containing a genetically-modified (GM) virus that he said would permanently lower your cholesterol levels and protect you against heart disease, what would you call that an injection? If you’re a normal person, you’d probably call it attempted assault. But if you’re TIME magazine, you’d erroneously call it a vaccine, of course.

As part of an ongoing and coordinated attack on cholesterol by the mainstream media and government health agencies, genetic butchers like Dr. Kiran Musunuru from Harvard University’s Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology are busy hatching new ways to reprogram the human genome to create “better” humans. And in the process, they’re disguising their schemes as “medicine” to trick people into accepting it as beneficial to their health.

As reported by TIME, Dr. Musunuru and his colleagues are trying really hard to capitalize on genetic engineering to accomplish what they believe will improve heart health for millions of people. Completely reinventing the definition of vaccine (just like scientists did back in 2012 by claiming to have invented an obesity “vaccine”), they’re pushing injections that they say have the potential to permanently inhibit circulating levels of cholesterol.

Ignoring the fact that cholesterol is a key substance that the body uses to produce hormones and regenerate brain cells, the researchers involved with the project clearly have a very low-level understanding of how the human body works. They were probably trained in medical school to think “cholesterol=bad,” and thus have spent their entire careers working on novel ways to eradicate it.

Now, they’ve successfully developed what they say is a solution. And with their mainstream media partners touting it as a vaccine – many members of the public are stuck in their own simplistic mindset of “vaccines=good” – the hope is that once it’s finally approved commercially, millions of people will line up to receive it without giving it a second thought.

“This approach in general will be a game changer,” claims Dr. Deepak Srivastava, director of cardiovascular disease and stem cell biology and regenerative medicine at the Gladstone Institutes.

Cholesterol isn’t bad, and genetically-modified viruses aren’t ‘vaccines’

Addressing the inherent flaws in the line of thinking that sees all cholesterol as evil is a topic for a whole separate article. But that’s the premise behind this new approach to lowering it with transgenic virus “vaccines” that change the normal way the body functions. It’s a typical approach in Western medicine that ignores any potential for unintended consequences that might lead to other problems for patients.

According to the study, which was published in the journal Circulation Research, mice that were given the injections saw more than half of their liver cells genetically edited within just a few days. Besides the virus itself, the vaccine also delivered a hefty dose of what TIME refers to as “DNA-disrupting machinery” that apparently allowed the virus to reach its intended target.

It’s like Frankenstein crossed with the Twilight Zone – but to doctors pretending to be God, it’s a miracle. Tinkering with the human genome is just “progress,” you see. There’s nothing sacred or off-limits when it comes to human tampering anymore, so long as it’s dubbed as medicine that provides benefits.

“The way I think about it, it’s about how to make the average person like that person who won the genetic lottery and is protected against heart disease,” Dr. Musunuru told the media, perfectly illustrating this point. Though his little concoction isn’t quite ready for the mainstream, he hopes it will be within the next few years.

“We want to extend the benefits the fortunate few have to the entire population. That would be the dream.

Washington Post writer says shooting Republican lawmakers is an act of “self-defense” … are all left-wing journalists insane?

As everybody knows by now, and despite claims to the contrary, the progressive movement is a movement based largely on hatred and bigotry towards people who don’t buy into the big government mindset. The latest example of this sort of left wing intolerance comes from Malcolm Harris, the Washington Post writer who recently took to social media to try to justify mass-shootings of congressional republicans following last week’s attack at a baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia.

“If the shooter has a serious health condition then is taking potshots at the GOP house leadership considered self-defense?” he tweeted. Just minutes later, he sent out another tweet that read, “Nope nope nope you can’t use ‘respect for human life’ to defend GOP house leadership. That’s just bad math.”

There are a number of things that come to mind upon hearing about a writer for the Washington Post that justifies shooting at republican members of congress. First, it’s shocking (and sadly, unsurprising) that the Washington Post would want to keep someone on their team who makes such sick and twisted public comments. As of the time that this article was written, the Washington Post has yet to take any action against Harris or condemn the remark in any way. If the people who run this fake news media outlet had even a shred of integrity whatsoever, they would fire Malcolm Harris immediately.

The second point is an obvious one — if there were ever a republican writer or commentator that publicly made a remark justifying a shooting that was directed towards democrat members of congress, the mainstream media would have a field day. But conveniently, because Malcolm Harris is a liberal writer for the Washington Post, not a word was said about him or his disturbing twitter rant on any of the left wing cable news channels.

Lastly — and this is something that most people who aren’t far left nutjobs will understand — is the fact that inciting violence against those with whom you disagree with politically is never acceptable. Regardless of whether or not you meant it as a joke, and regardless of your explanation, we as a society should never give a pass to those who embrace the use of violence against those on the opposite side of the political spectrum.

It’s truly unfortunate, but this is how many (certainly not all, but many) on the left have always been. But ever since Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton and became the 45th president of the United States, their true colors have been coming out more and more frequently. (Related: The defeated liberals are now calling for the murder of Trump supporters.)

In February, Breitbart News reported on research compiled by the social media analytics company Dataminr, which found that there have been over 12,000 tweets since Inauguration Day calling for the assassination of President Trump. “Can someone take one for the team and assassinate trump when he comes to the U.K.??” wrote one twitter user. “I hate to say this, but can someone just assassinate Trump already?” another said. Yet another person posted, “I hope Melania has a secret plan to assassinate Trump and Pence with the help of her Slovenian family.”

Then of course there was the Kathy Griffin controversy, when “comedian” Kathy Griffin published a photo of herself holding up a bloodied mask of President Trump, making it seem as though he had been decapitated. More recently, a man who looked conveniently similar to Donald Trump played the lead role in a production of Julius Caesar and was mercilessly stabbed to death during one of the scenes, shocking the audience in Central Park as well as millions of Americans across the country.

Put simply, when it comes to most congressional democrats and liberal journalists, civility is virtually nonexistent. And with President Trump in the White House for at least three and a half more years, it’s only going to get worse.

Insanely stupid leftists think it’s a crime for U.S. officials to talk to Russian officials… DIPLOMACY is now a crime?

Whether you like President Trump’s plan for the country or not, one thing you can’t say about this administration (unlike the previous administration) is that Trump and his team are operating in an unlawful or unconstitutional manner. There is nothing that the President has done or even proposed thus far that is an impeachable offense, which is unfortunate for the left because they so desperately want to get him out of office. However, as we’ve learned over the past few months, the fact that there isn’t anything unlawful or unconstitutional about the way President Trump is governing is no obstacle for the radical left. Congressional democrats and the mainstream media know that all they have to do is make Americans think President Trump is scandalous and corrupt, and then proceed with their calls for impeachment.

We saw this just days after Inauguration Day when Trump attempted to implement a temporary travel ban on countries that are known for terrorism. Even though our immigration laws make it abundantly clear that the president has the ability to determine who comes into the country and who does not, the left spun the entire story to make Trump look like the big bad villain. We were told that Trump is a racist and a bigot because “he is trying to ban Muslims from the country,” even though the travel ban would only affect 13 percent of the world’s Muslims. We were told that the travel ban was unconstitutional because it infringes on the First Amendment rights of immigrants, as if our Constitution was written for the entire world, Americans and foreigners alike. All of this despite the fact that President Trump’s proposed travel ban was entirely lawful and well within the confines of the Constitution.

This pattern of false outrage and manufactured scandals is perhaps most prevalent in the ongoing Russia narrative. According to virtually every left wing democrat in the United States, Donald Trump and members of his team colluded with the Russians throughout the 2016 presidential election, and had it not been for Vladimir Putin and his ilk, Hillary Clinton would be our 45th president. In order to perpetuate this narrative, the left have essentially convinced millions of Americans that any contact with any Russians whatsoever is scandalous and therefore must be investigated. Even though politicians and U.S. officials communicate with the Russians all the time (and have for decades), we’re told that when someone inside the Trump administration does it, they’re automatically corrupt.

The persistent political assault on Attorney General Jeff Sessions is a perfect example of how congressional democrats and the liberal media turn any contact with the Russians into some kind of a criminal offense. One of the most common talking points used by the left is that Jeff Sessions lied under oath when he said that he did not have any contact with the Russians regarding the 2016 presidential election.

During his hearing back in January, Jeff Sessions was asked the following question from Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy: “Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after election day?” Sessions responded, “No.”

A follow up question came from Minnesota Senator Al Franken, who referred to a recent CNN report alleging that the Trump campaign was communicating with the Russians throughout the election. “If it’s true, it’s obviously extremely serious,” Franken said of the report. “And if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?”

“I’m not aware of any of those activities,” Sessions replied. “I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians.”

It was later revealed that Jeff Sessions did in fact communicate with the Russians, which is extremely common for members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. A spokeswoman for Jeff Sessions also noted that in 2016, Sessions was in contact with over 25 ambassadors, including ambassadors to Britain, Korea, Japan, Poland, India, China, Canada, Australia and Germany.

So did Jeff Sessions really lie under oath? Of course not. The fact of the matter is that when Sessions was answering those questions from Senator Leahy and Senator Franken, he was answering in the context of the Trump campaign. Under oath, Sessions said that he had never communicated with the Russians about the 2016 presidential election, which is the absolute truth.

This is how the liberals have conducted and covered the entire Russia probe thus far — they have made it seem as though any contact between any member of the Trump team and the Russians is scandalous, which of course, is nuts. Is diplomacy now a crime?

(Natural News) Nothing says friendship like pizza, or does it? A recent study of college students at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that a staggering 98 percent were willing to give up their friends’ email addresses for a slice of pizza — not even a whole pizza, just one piece. Clearly, kids these days don’t have their priorities straight.

The research, led by the National Bureau of Economic Research, surveyed 3,108 MIT attendees. In their research, half of the group was offered a slice of pizza to betray their friends’ privacy and cough up their email addresses. The overwhelming majority couldn’t pass up a slice of the good stuff. But what is even more surprising is how many students were willing to give up their friends’ email addresses with no incentive at all. The researchers found that even without a tasty treat, a shocking 94 percent of MIT students were still willing to share their friends’ emails. In the non-incentivized group, just six percent of students presented phony email addresses to protect their friends, compared to two percent in the pizza group.

However, it is worth noting that not giving up the email addresses was actually not an option for the survey. Kids were essentially given two options: Give up the real emails, or make up fake ones.

Do Americans prefer pizza or privacy?

These findings lie in stark contrast to the commonly held belief that Americans value their privacy. Pew Research data has shown that roughly three-quarters of United States citizens say that it is “very important” to have control over who can obtain information about them. And, six out of ten people also claim that “they would never be comfortable sharing their email contacts.” And yet, there’s that 98 percent of college students who’d give up their friends’ emails just for some pizza. Even though people say they value their privacy, it seems as if younger generations are slowly losing sight of what “privacy” really means. In the ever-growing digital world, the concept of a “private life” is clearly diminishing.

As Pew Research states, ” If the traditional American view of privacy is the ‘right to be left alone,’ the 21st-century refinement of that idea is the right to control their identity and information. They understand that modern life won’t allow them to be ‘left alone’ and untracked, but they do want to have a say in how their personal information is used.”

Privacy disappearing in the digital age

Across all fronts, true privacy is becoming an increasingly rare thing. From social media to data collection to hackers, and everything in between, it’s clear that people are losing track of what “privacy” actually entails. Furthermore, in today’s digital world, where it often seems that every detail of your life is up for grabs, it’s becoming increasingly easy to become a victim of a cyber crime. Many Americans seem to struggle with understanding that their digital life is not in fact a private life, and that there are serious risks that come with this new cyber world that’s been created.

For example, the passwords “123456” and “password” are still the top passwords for email addresses cracked by hackers. It’s 2017, not 1997; no one should still be using those two choices as passwords for important accounts like email or bank accounts anymore. And yet, they still are fairly common.

Privacy is something that was once revered, but now seems to be rather misunderstood. In the digital age, if you do not take precautions to secure your information, you cannot just assume it’s safe. You never know when someone with a slice of pizza is going to come around.

(Natural News) Blackhawks star Marian Hossa may have just played his final NHL game and might sit out the upcoming 2017-2018 season, as the athlete is allegedly suffering from a severe allergic reaction stemming from his hockey equipment.

Team doctor Michael Terry described Hossa’s ailment as a progressive skin disorder, and noted the declining efficacy of the medications the athlete is currently taking. According to recent reports, the drugs Hossa is taking to counter the allergic reaction are so potent that physicians actually called for routine blood testing every few weeks to ensure that no major side effects take place.

“I would say usually it’s much more itchy than painful. Think of this as large parts of the body with a poison ivy reaction. Scratching can cause open sores. For a lot of people, the open sores and pain are more tolerable than the chronic itching. It’s not the fabric itself but the things it’s treated with. Every exposure makes it progressively worse,” said Warren Piette, the dermatology division chairman at Stroger Hospital.

“If it’s unclear what he’s allergic to do, it would be hard to avoid something you don’t know to avoid. It perpetuates itself because the skin never heals with playing hockey every day…We see people with allergic reactions to shin guards, shoes, ice skates. In cases I’ve seen, we’ve put in a protective layer (between the skin and equipment)…Sometimes taking a break from the equipment and letting the skin heal is best. If you can completely avoid it, it should get better,” said dermatologist Amy Derick.

Hossa, 38, came into the league during the 1997-1998 season, and has scored 525 goals and 609 assists. The future Hall of Famer joined the Blackhawks in 2009.

Skin disorder is all too familiar among athletes

Hossa’s current skin condition was not the first time that the disease manifested in athletes. In fact, former Blackhawks and Minnesota North Stars defenseman Tom Reid had a bout with a skin disease, known only as “the gunk”, in the 1970s. According to Reid, the skin condition started as a quarter-sized spot on his left arm, which rapidly progressed and eventually spread to his torso from the waist to the upper chest area.

Reid noted that the condition took away a layer of skin in the affected area, as the skin shed and stuck to fabric. A combination of sweat and friction exacerbated the condition. Reid tried various treatments, but the skin condition eventually forced him to retire from the rink after 11 years. According to Reid, at least 40 players were also forced to retire because of the skin disorder. (Related: The right vitamins may naturally improve skin condition)

Former Red Wings goalie Gilles Gilbert also reported a progressive skin disease that led to his forced retirement in the early 1980s.

Kellyanne Conway: Mika Brzezinski’s claim is “rich” whiny hypocrisy considering her constant trashing of Trump’s female supporters

After a week in which CNN has been completely outed as fake news propaganda mill and a pair of MSNBC hosts as blatant hypocrites, presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway said in an exclusive interview with The Daily Caller she and Donald J. Trump are not serving “the one percenters” but are there for Americans who are really suffering.

In dissecting the constant hate from the discredited, dishonest “mainstream” media, Conway blasted CNN for being crippled by Trump Derangement Syndrome, which is pervasive throughout the network’s office culture.

The Daily Caller noted further:

Conway spoke with The Daily Caller after James O’Keefe and Project Veritas released a video showing a producer for CNN’s Chris Cuomo saying that Conway “looks like she was hit with a shovel” and calling her an “awful woman.”

“On this guy from CNN, it’s part of a culture where it’s accepted if not applauded to ridicule the President of the United States and his senior staff. And I’m sure people at CNN are hoping that the long holiday weekend, and as many of them have described to me that the ‘lowly junior status’ of this fellow, is supposed to fade into the Independence Day fireworks,” she said. (RELATED: Trump’s Mika tweet over the top? What about ALL her media attacks on the president?)

“It is symptomatic of a culture whether it’s the screaming lower third (of the TV screen) or the constant merciless attacks on the president and his senior staff,” she continues in the exclusive with The Daily Caller. “In many ways he (CNN producer Jimmy Carr) was just joining in on the fun. I’m waiting, waiting, waiting for someone there to stand up and express their outrage at a high-ranking woman at the White House being talked about in such ways.”

In the undercover video, Carr also calls American voters “stupid as s**t,” a possible reference the fact that more voters in a majority of states chose Trump instead of Hillary Clinton, a wholly corrupt product and figure of the establishment swamp Trump and his administration seek to vanquish.

For her part, Conway also had some words for “Morning Joe” co-host Mika Brzezinski, whom she implied was being hypocritical in her criticism of some recent Trump tweets describing her as “low I.Q.” and “bleeding from a facelift” when she and Scarborough attempted to see him at his Mar-A-Lago resort New Year’s Eve. [On Friday, primary host Joe Scarborough admitted that his bride-to-be “did have a little skin under her chin tweaked, but this was hardly a state secret,” The Daily Caller reported.]

Conway noted that Brzezinski has routinely been critical of women who supported Trump and continues to do so.

The media covered Trump’s tweets as just the latest example of his so-called ‘pattern of sexist comments.’ Conway, however, dismissed those allegations, then said that the “Morning Joe” co-host herself has a history of singling out Trump-supporting women.

In fact, Conway brought it up that Brzezinski has said she no longer wanted the Trump adviser on the morning program because she was nothing more than “politics porn.”

“When Mika said what she has said about me, I have not responded. All those things she’s said about me — ‘politics porn,’ ‘liar,’ ‘nothing honest about Kellyanne Conway’ — I haven’t responded to that, I haven’t shown the texts, I’ve sort of just sucked it up, swallowed it, dealt with the crying kids about it,” she said, adding: “This whole idea that she’s some victim of sexism is really rich just for any woman who works here.”

She then noted that she and the president — and his entire team — are not there to talk about media-generated hysteria surrounding Trump’s tweets regarding Brzezinski and Scarborough because that’s “a one-percenters conversation too.”

“Let’s be frank here, it’s a one-percenter’s conversation,” she told The Daily Caller. “I’m here for those people who need help, the women have no jobs, no healthcare, struggling with opioid addiction, whose kids have been murdered by illegal aliens who hadn’t been deported, had felony convictions — I’m here for all them, as is the president.”

CNN’s Van Jones is a crisis actor! He faked mental anguish over the Russian collusion story that he knew was fake

If you’re old enough (or if you listen to Classic Rock stations), you may recall Don Henley’s smash 1980s hit, “Dirty Laundry,” which is an extremely critical look at the “mainstream” media. And as the song’s lyrics make plain, Henley nails it:

Dirty little secrets

Dirty little lies

We got our dirty little fingers in everybody’s pie

We love to cut you down to size

We love dirty laundry…

Kick ‘em when they’re up…

Kick ‘em when they’re down…

We can do “The Innuendo”

We can dance and sing

When it’s said and done we haven’t told you a thing

We all know that crap is king

Give us dirty laundry!

And remember, this song was written in the 1980s; not much has changed at all, has it?

CNN is becoming a case study in how disgustingly dishonest the media really is: How it lies, smears and purposefully distorts in order to undermine and destroy the reputations of people — mostly politicians — they don’t like or agree with.

In the vast majority of cases, the mainstream media’s most-attacked political figures are Republicans. And these days in particular, the most attacked Republican figure is President Donald J. Trump.

For its part, CNN has decided that the best way to both bolster ratings and feed red meat to its deranged viewing base is to continue pushing the fake narrative that Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin got together and launched a sneaky, diabolical plan to “hack” the election and “steal” it from Hillary Clinton.

And to accomplish that, it has essentially employed what can only be described as “crisis actors” — like former Obama administration official and Democrat operative Van Jones.

In a recent undercover media sting perpetrated by James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas, Jones can be seen and heard discounting the “Russia” story. Asked about it by the undercover journalist, Jones replies:

“The Russia thing is just a big nothing burger,” he says.

“Really?” the undercover media operative replies.

“Yep,” says Jones.

But Jones has been one of the CNN “political experts” pushing the narrative, as the Project Veritas video notes:

And what about that time when he spent election night, upon the realization that Trump was going to be president, pontificating about explaining to his kids how a “bully” and a “bigot” could become president, describing that as his “biggest fear”?

It’s just this kind of nonsensical — and dishonest — representation of events that Jones really ought to explain.

As Zero Hedge notes:

Perhaps it’s time to think about how you can explain to your children why you exploited your position and fame to provoke mass hysteria among a divided American electorate, over a story you knew to be false…hysteria which very well could have contributed to a mass shooting that nearly claimed the life of Steven Scalise.

Indeed.

Kick ‘em when they’re up…

Kick ‘em when they’re down…

Meantime, Jones has continued to denigrate the president over Russia. In May, Jones said on the network that Trump’s response to the FBI’s “Russia” investigation is turning him into “President Snowflake.”

“When he ran, he was this tough guy. This guy is going to get things done. He’s a great negotiator. He’s Trumpzilla. He was going to make Washington bow down. He was going to drain the swamp. Now, he’s President Snowflake.’ Okay?” he said.

“Everything he’s said is, ‘Oh, they’re mean to me,’ and ‘they don’t like me,’ and ‘I just don’t understand it and it’s not fair!’”

Before, he referred to Trump’s win as a “white lash,” again insinuating that a bunch of racists elected him.

We can do “The Innuendo”

We can dance and sing

When it’s said and done we haven’t told you a thing

We all know that “crap is king,” Van.

Remember when the Left said McCarthy’s concern over Russians was “paranoia?” Now, Democrats are leading the new McCarthyism

Let’s be honest — the democratic party is broken, and in more ways than one. Ever since Donald Trump’s upset victory over Hillary Clinton last November, the left has been growing more and more hostile towards conservatives, which is ironic coming from the party that supposedly stands for tolerance and compassion. Of course, most recently the liberals have been peddling the false narrative that Donald Trump and his team colluded with the Russians throughout the presidential election, an allegation that still has no evidence to back it up whatsoever — but they don’t care. Night and day, liberal networks like CNN and MSNBC are focused on “the Russia scandal,” with hosts like Don Lemon and Joe Scarborough bringing on an endless amount of talking heads to help them advance their narrative.

One could argue that they are experiencing a mix of paranoia and pure hatred towards the president of the United States. However, less than one hundred years ago, the progressives were criticizing republicans for doing essentially the same exact thing that these progressives are doing today.

As most older Americans probably remember, many people in the late 1940s and the early 1950s were extremely fearful of the spread of communism both in our country and abroad. One of the most prominent symbols of this mid-century “Red Scare” was a man named Joseph McCarthy, a republican senator from the state of Wisconsin.

In February of 1950, McCarthy gave a speech at the Ohio County Women’s Republican Club in Wheeling, West Virginia. While waving a piece of paper in the air, the Wisconsin senator declared that he had a full list of 205 communists that were “working and shaping policy” within the State Department. Does this sound like anything a leftist like Chuck Schumer or Nancy Pelosi would do today regarding the Trump-Russia scandal? Yes, it absolutely does.

At the time, progressive Americans detested people like Senator McCarthy who were constantly on the lookout for communists, which shouldn’t come as much of a surprise considering the fact the communist really isn’t that far off from modern day liberalism. They routinely derided those on the right side of the political spectrum, and yet they are doing the same exact things today as the McCarthy republicans did nearly seven decades ago. In this way, the McCarthy era is almost repeating itself, only this time, instead of those on the right relentlessly linking democrats to communism, those on the left are relentlessly linking republicans (and more specifically, Donald Trump) to the Russians.

There is a difference, however. Throughout the 50’s and the years that followed, the rise of communism really was a significant threat to both the United States and the world. In fact, there is an argument to be made that Senator McCarthy was right to be so concerned about the establishment of an authoritarian regime in America, considering the fact that today’s democratic party has essentially become just that. On the contrary, the liberal narrative that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians throughout the presidential election lacks any evidence whatsoever, and really has become nothing more than an endless stream of left wing propaganda.

This left wing propaganda was on full display over the past few days as the fake news network CNN published and then retracted a blatantly false hit piece on Donald Trump, accusing him of being indirectly connected to a Russian investment fund. Without a doubt, the liberal media and virtually the entire democrat party is now engaged in a massive witch hunt against the President and his administration, not so much because they care about collusion with Vladimir Putin (Hillary Clinton sold 20 percent of the United States’ uranium production to the Russians and the liberals were absolutely silent) but because they are entirely committed to removing Donald Trump from the Oval Office.

Trump’s Mika tweet over the top? What about ALL her media attacks on the president?

If you’ve paid any attention at all to cable news or online political coverage you know that the latest media “outrage” at President Donald J. Trump is over a series of tweets earlier this week in which it is claimed that he “attacked” MSNBC morning show co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski.

What was particularly galling to the “dish-it-out-but-can’t-take-it” establishment media was Trump’s targeting of Brzezinski, in which he commented on her intellect and past physical appearance.

“I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don’t watch anymore),” Trump tweeted. “Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe [Scarborough,] came to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year’s Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no!”

As reported by Business Insider, Trump’s tweet came after Dan Scavino, Trump’s social media director, tweeted: “#DumbAsARockMika and lover #JealousJoe are lost, confused & saddened since @POTUS @realDonaldTrump stopped returning their calls! Unhinged.”

What in the world? Has Trump lost his mind, for real? Where’d this all come from?

That’s easy: The tweets by Trump and Scavino came in direct response to things Brzezinski and, to a lesser extent, Scarborough, had said earlier on their program, “Morning Joe.”

[The couple is engaged to be married, by the way, so no conflict of interest there. And here’s a fun fact: Trump even offered to officiate it, an offer which Miki declined].

As Business Insider noted:

The segment took aim at a fake Time magazine cover featuring Trump that hangs at several of Trump’s golf clubs and properties, according to The Washington Post.

“Nothing makes a man feel better than making a fake cover of a magazine about himself lying every day and destroying the country,” Brzezinski said.

Brzezinski also said Trump was covering his hands on the fake Time cover “because they’re teensy.”

The ‘small hands’ remark has been used by Trump haters to make insinuations about the size of his, shall we say, manhood.

And in that vein, Brzezinski followed up Trump’s tweets with another small hands reference — a tweet featuring a picture of a box of Cheerios with the words, “Made For Little Hands.”

For some years, Trump had a good relationship with the MSNBC co-hosts. They were all friendly before the billionaire businessman made the decision to run for president. Initially, the pair supported his candidacy, but — likely due to pressure from the Trump-haters who run the network — they turned on him and have heavily mocked and criticized him since.

Of Trump’s tweets, a spokesman for MSNBC told Business Insider that “it’s a sad day for America when the president spends his time bullying, lying, and spewing petty personal attacks instead of doing his job.”

Well, it’s also been a sad several months for MSNBC and the rest of the “mainstream” media, all of whom are still so angry that Trump beat their beloved Hillary Clinton that they have become overcome with Trump Derangement Syndrome. (RELATED: Top CNN political contributor now admitting the Trump-Russia narrative is a big hoax: Network credibility collapse continues)

That is especially true of Scarborough and Brezinski, who — according to this Rolling Stone interview and timeline — said they considered voting for Trump at one time, but decided that “the last straw” came over his “Muslim ban” [which is a crock, considering that Trump has never intended to “ban Muslims,” just people who happen to live in a half-dozen terrorist hotbeds… he doesn’t want the U.S. to end up being perpetually attacked like Europe].

The fact is, simply, this: The disgustingly dishonest, discredited establishment media has never encountered a ‘foe’ like Trump. He doesn’t quit, he doesn’t retreat, and he fights back — which is precisely why tens of millions of Americans voted for him.

Is Trump ‘over the top?’ Probably, but that’s his personality. He built his brand partially on that personality.

It’s just ludicrous to now hear people in the media complain about it, when they have known all along that’s who he is.

(Natural News) Meandering through the latest mainstream media headlines these days, one is hard-pressed to find even a semblance of objective truth on virtually any topic. It’s all anti-Trump, pro-G.M.O., and pro-vaccine propaganda, it seems, including at the left-leaning news publication Mother Jones where such positions are regularly brow-beaten into readers at an excruciating pace.

While claiming to be a “progressive” magazine centered around “investigative reporting on topics including politics, the environment, human rights, and culture,” “MoJo” (as Mother Jones is often referred to in short) hardly embodies this mission in its day-to-day news cycle. Over the past several years, Mother Jones has debased itself into little more than a brainwashing mouthpiece for corporate propaganda.

Concerning genetically-modified organisms and biotechnology, for instance, Mother Jones has adopted the industry position that the world somehow needs transgenic crops and fake food to overcome the impending doom of “climate change.” In a piece that would make even the most stoic Monsanto executive blush, Mother Jones declared that “G.M.O.s won’t harm your health,” insisting that chemically-poisoned mutant crops are of little or no concern to the general public.

Much like now-pro-G.M.O. shill Bill Nye, there was once a time when Mother Jones openly voiced healthy skepticism about G.M.O.s. But now, the magazine functions almost like an arm of Monsanto’s marketing department, shamelessly spreading fake science under the guise of “independent journalism.”

Vaccines, Never Trump, Planned Parenthood: Is there any special interest to which Mother Jones won’t pander?

It isn’t just in the area of biotechnology where Mother Jones has gone astray. The magazine routinely shills for the vaccine industry as well, publishing propaganda articles about “vaccine deniers” putting children’s lives at risk. Even as far back as 2008, Mother Jones was actively shilling for parents to listen to government authorities and accept vaccines without question – because of “science,” of course.

“Vaccine resisters are motivated by a range of convictions,” Mother Jones writer Arthur Allen declared with patronizing condescension, adding as a definition his own opinion the straw man sentiments that “immunization isn’t ‘natural’ (the wellness set), it’s suspect because it’s government mandated (Christian home-schoolers), and so on.”

Mother Jones allowed Allen to publish crap like this while completely ignoring the real reasons why many parents object to vaccines – one of the most obvious to anyone who’s researched them being the fact that the package inserts themselves warn of potentially serious side effects like autism, as well as death.

Then there’s President Donald Trump, who Mother Jones wants its readers to hate. In a piece published just days ago, Mother Jones writer Kevin Drum made the declaration that the U.S. president “has no foreign policy,” referring to a message he “tweeted” about China’s involvement with addressing the North Korea situation.

Drum claims to know exactly what the President was saying in this particular tweet, rejecting any possibility of subtext or irony that may have gone right over his head, using this to mock Pres. Trump and make him appear stupid to readers. The objective, of course, is to convince as many Mother Jones readers as possible that Pres. Trump isn’t worthy of respect, and that everyone should hate him because the mainstream media tells them to.

“Trump has been suckered by China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia,” Drum writes, fully convinced of his intellectual superiority on the matter. “He has pissed off Mexico, Canada, Germany, France, Britain, Australia, and most of our other traditional allies,” continues this verbal diarrhea in typical mainstream media form.

Mother Jones has even shilled for Planned Parenthood, defending the abortion group’s illegal practice of harvesting and selling murdered baby body parts to the highest bidder.

(Natural News) One of the popular objections to the GOP proposals to reform health insurance markets is that the Affordable Care Act (aka “ObamaCare”) saved thousands of lives per year, and hence that tinkering with ObamaCare will literally kill lots of people. For example, Hillary Clinton tweeted out:

“Forget death panels. If Republicans pass this bill, they’re the death party.”

(Article by Robert P. Murphy republished from Mises.org

Now to be sure, even if the claim were true, it still wouldn’t follow that coercive redistribution of wealth was morally justified. However, as happens so often in political controversies, libertarians don’t have to choose between property rights and preventing widespread suffering. Believe it or not, the data suggest that if anything, ObamaCare actually caused more Americans to die.

None of what I write in this piece should be construed as an endorsement of the GOP bills. But the claim that they would “kill lots of people” is not valid.

Oren Cass’s Amazing Takedown

The researcher who alerted me to these awkward facts was the Manhattan Institute’s Oren Cass. Cass makes three important points in his recent study:

#1. The various estimates of the alleged lives saved under ObamaCare were not based on actual mortality data. Rather, these pro-ObamaCare studies relied on previous episodes (such as the implementation of “RomneyCare” in Massachusetts) where the expansion of insurance coverage went hand-in-hand with improved health outcomes. Then, taking this correlation as a “fact,” the pro-ObamaCare researchers multiplied by the expansion of insurance under ObamaCare and came up with an estimate of how many Americans’ lives were saved.

Yet as Cass points out, this procedure is flawed. What the literature actually shows is that expansion of privatehealth insurance coverage contributes to improved health outcomes. But under ObamaCare, the amount of private coverage went down relative to what we would have expected in the absence of the legislation. What really drove the increase in insurance coverage under ObamaCare was the expansion of Medicaid. And here, it is much less obvious that this is a boon for health outcomes, as the now infamous Oregon experiment shows.

Looking at the Aggregate Data

#2. Now that we’ve undercut the foundations of the pro-ObamaCare figures, we can turn to the actual mortality data from the U.S. After all, as Cass says, if ObamaCare really has been avoiding tens of thousands of deaths per year, we should see that in the data.

And yet, we see the opposite. Although the ACA passed in 2010, the full expansion of insurance coverage didn’t kick in until 2014. So the relevant metric is to see what happened to (age-adjusted) mortality rates before and after 2014. Lo and behold:

U.S. Age-Adjusted Mortality Rates per 100,000 (Annual, 2002–2015)

Source: CDC WONDER Database

As the figure shows, if we control for the aging of the population, the mortality rate tends to fall over time. However, for whatever reason, after falling in 2014, the mortality jumped back up in 2015, erasing all the gains since 2013.

To see that this isn’t some artifact of this data set, we can cross-reference this information with life expectancy. Some readers may have been aware that researchers were alarmed in late 2016 when the latest figures showed U.S. life expectancy falling “for the first time in decades.”

Looking at the State-Level Data

#3. But now we come to the third and most devastating component of the Cass study. He is intellectually honest and concedes that the uptick in mortality in 2015 could be a fluke, or it could be a genuine problem due to something other than ObamaCare. For example, there is a festering opioid epidemic in many parts of the US, so perhaps it was just bad luck (for Obama’s legacy) that this public health crisis happened to hit right when his signature legislature fully kicked in.

Yet Cass points out that we still have a pretty good control group to assess the specific impact of the Affordable Care Act’s boost to coverage. Specifically, only 31 states (plus DC) expanded Medicaid under the ACA, while the other 19 states rejected the offer. So if it’s true that the ACA really did “save lives” relative to what otherwise would have happened, but that the absolute mortality rate in the US went up because of some external problem (like the opioid crisis), then we should still expect see mortality rates jumping more in the “red” states that rejected Medicaid expansion.

And yet, as Cass points out in his study, we see the exact opposite. Namely, the states that took advantage of ObamaCare’s Medicaid expansion saw a worse impact on their mortality rates than the states that rejected the expansion.

Conclusion

Although I personally do not yet have a theory on the specific mechanism that may be responsible, I amconfident in saying that the actual data do not support the breathless claims that rolling back ObamaCare will literally kill many thousands of Americans. Fans of the Austrian school should not be shocked, though, to discover that having the federal government get more heavily involved in the health sector has apparently made things worse.

(Natural News) Just like Eve who was lured into taking a bite out of the forbidden apple in the Garden of Eden, many people today are enamored with the idea of chomping down on anything that tech giant Apple throws their way. This includes so-called “next level” technologies like the one the Apple is currently working on and soon to unveil, known as “augmented reality.” A.R. will reportedly allow users to basically live in a fake world filled with superimposed images of things that don’t actually exist.

At the recent 2017 Worldwide Developers Conference (W.W.D.C.), Apple C.E.O. Tim Cook was brimming with excitement over the prospect of coaxing even more unsuspecting victims into his company’s latest technological snare. Speaking about A.R., Cook told the media that he is “so excited about it” that he literally wants to “yell out and scream.”

Whether gleefully naive or even demonic, Cook’s guttural response to A.R.’s release is particularly bizarre, especially when considering that it serves no real purpose other than to erase yet another element of humanity from the social sphere. By drawing more people into a fake reality projected through virtual simulations – similar to the Google Glass concept – society will become even more glued to their phones and other similar technologies at the expense of interacting with others.

“The first step in making it a mainstream kind of experience is to put it in the operating system,” Cook stated, admitting that A.R. could end up becoming a Pandora’s Box of unintended consequences for society. “We’re building it into iOS 11, opening it to developers – and unleashing the creativity of millions of people. Even we can’t predict what’s going to come out.” (Related: To keep up with the latest developments in virtual reality technology, be sure to visit and bookmark VirtualReality.news.)

Oh, and Tim Cook doesn’t really like President Trump, by the way

For some reason during an interview that was supposed to center around A.R., Cook was asked by Bloomberg about his experiences working with President Trump. Perhaps expectedly, Cook was all to keen on commenting about the many things he and the president disagree on, including issues like illegal immigration and climate change.

“There are clearly areas where we’re not nearly on the same page,” Cook explained, adding that he was “very disappointed” when President Trump decided to pull the United States out of the deceptive and illegitimate Paris Climate Accord. Unwilling to even consider the reasons why the president shut down the deal, Cook emphasized his misguided opinion that “America is more important than blood politics,” whatever that is supposed to mean.

As the interview circled back around to the topic at hand, Cook added a little more about the eventual release of A.R., which isn’t quite ready for the mainstream. Even so, Cook stated that “it’s time to put the seat belt on and go,” insisting that people are already having A.R. experiences every time they eat a meal, for instance.

Apple hopes to release it’s first A.R. glasses later in the year, with plans to have them sync up to people’s iPhones and Apple Watch devices. The goal is to convince the public that it’s completely normal to walk around with futuristic-looking goggles on their faces that recreate the world around them into a Pokemon Go-type virtual reality simulation. The prospect of creating a fake world for humans to live in is “really cool,” according to Cook, though he insists that it will somehow encourage rather than replace human contact. His rationale is that rather than fully embody a virtual reality, augmented reality technology will simply enhance what’s already there.

(Natural News) A recently uncovered report by the Institute of Biophysics in Moscow revealed that Russia has covered up a disastrous nuclear weapons test, one that was reportedly four times worse than Chernobyl, that occurred in the 1950s. The covered-up report was found in the archive of the Institute of Radiation Medicine and Ecology (IRME) in Semey, Kazakhstan. Semey was formerly called Semipalatinsk.

According to NewScientist.com, a faulty Soviet nuclear test that was carried out in August 1956 at Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan caused the burning of the city of Ust-Kamenogorsk. As a result, more than 600 people were hospitalized due to radiation sickness, while at least 100,000 people, while also falling victim to radiation’s harmful effects, were lucky to not have been hospitalized. The report also found that a scientific expedition was sent out to Semipalatinsk following the explosion, which noted a widespread radioactive contamination of soil and food and radiation sickness across the Kazakh Steppe, an open grassland area in the north. The expedition team then monitored the effects of the explosion while nuclear tests continued. However, the catastrophic event has been kept a secret for many years.

Despite having suffered a disastrous fallout in the area, Semipalatinsk continued to be the site of nuclear bomb tests. As per the report, more nuclear bombs were tested at Semipalatinsk than anywhere else in the world during the 1950s and early 1960s. Since the break up of the Soviet Union, western media practitioners have covered stories about the apparent effects of a series of nuclear tests on the residents living near the area.

The aftermath of the faulty nuclear bomb test

A month after the fallout, in September 1956, clouds continued to engulf Ust-Kamenogorsk and radiation dose rates remained at 1.6 millirems per hour in the area, which was a hundred times the radiation rate that was considered safe by the International Commission on Radiological Protection.

Radioactive substances also continued to contaminate Znamenka, a village near Ust-Kamenogorsk, for five years. Incidentally, radiation fallout was more intense in the area than in Ust-Kamenogorsk. Military medical officers who visited Znamenka after the nuclear test noted that three people suffered from acute radiation sickness.

The scientific expeditions resulted in the establishment of a Moscow-controlled specialty clinic, which monitored the persistent radiation and its subsequent effects on human health. For a long time, the facility was named Anti-Brucellosis Dispensary No. 4 in an effort to cover up the clinic’s real activity, which remained top secret until 1991.

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the dispensary became IRME. However, the institute’s current chief scientist, Boris Gusev, noted that many reports on the catastrophic event were either taken to Moscow or destroyed prior to the organizational change. The total number of people who died due to the explosion still eludes scientists today. According to the institute’s director, Kazbek Apsalikov, much of Semipalatinsk is now safe to live in; however, some areas may not become completely livable again.

Trump State Dept. has launched probe into Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified emails … and she STILL has security clearance to access sensitive data

At a political rally in Iowa Wednesday night, President Donald J. Trump’s speech to supporters was interrupted with chants of “Lock her up!” — a reference to vanquished Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s criminal mishandling of classified emails and other data during her stint as President Obama’s secretary of state.

Trump said he certainly understood the sentiment, which may have been in reference to recent testimony by fired FBI Director James Comey, who told the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier this month that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch ordered him to refer to the bureau’s criminal email investigation of Clinton as a “matter.”

In addition, the president, during his campaign, himself made pledges to investigate Clinton’s email scandal, which involved her improper use of a private, unsecured server.

That process may now be underway, though not formally by the White House.

Fox News reported this week that the State Department has launched a new formal inquiry into Clinton’s email scandal, a probe that includes some of her top aides. But more worrisome — and confusing — to critics is that Clinton still retains her top secret security clearance and still has access to sensitive government information.

The report noted further:

The department’s investigation aims to determine whether Clinton and her closest aides violated government protocols by using her private server to receive, hold and transmit classified and top-secret government documents. The department declined to say when its inquiry began, but it follows the conclusion of the FBI’s probe into the matter, which did not result in any actions being taken against Clinton or any of her aides.

If investigators for the nation’s diplomatic service find sufficient evidence of wrongdoing, Clinton and the aides involved in the probe — which was confirmed to Fox News by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa — could lose their clearances and, thus, their access to sensitive information.

That’s precisely what should have already happened, argue critics.

Among them is Chris Farrell of the conservative government legal watchdog organization Judicial Watch, which has filed several lawsuits related to Clinton’s email scandal. He told Fox News that Clinton and her “circle of national security criminals” should not now have any access whatsoever to any sensitive, classified data.

“Their conduct has cost them that privileged position of special trust and confidence,” he said, nothing that any other government employee would have been arrested and charged with violations of law under 18 U.S. Code Sec. 792(f), which is “Mishandling National Defense Information.” If found guilty, the accused would then be subject to a long prison sentence and very large fines, he added.

“This flagrant double standard for the gang that exposed Top Secret Codeword material to the Russians, Chinese and others is both offensive and deeply corrosive to the intelligence community,” Farrell noted. “There is no better evidence that when it comes to Hillary Clinton and her côtèrie — laws are for the little people.” (RELATED: Report: Email in Clinton probe led Obama AG Lynch to promise protection against prosecution of Clinton)

In a July 5, 2016, statement to the media, Comey detailed a litany of national security violations Clinton had committed, but then failed to recommend she be prosecuted. During his recent Senate testimony he said he didn’t recommend indictment because he didn’t believe Lynch’s Justice Department would follow through.

In addition to the new State Department inquiry into Clinton’s email, Grassley said his committee launched its own probe in March, citing Comey’s July 5 statement that the FBI found that Clinton and her staffers were “extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.”

Grassley also has noted that he believes there is “evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information…”

During their initial probe, FBI investigators discovered seven Clinton email chains on her computer classified at the “Top Secret/Special Access Program” level — at the very top of the most sensitive information. Another 2,000 emails discovered were not classified at the time but were later classified.

They also found an additional 22 emails that were deemed too damaging to national security to even be released.

(Natural News) Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey published a video on Facebook last week urging civilians to make sure they can properly defend themselves in the event that war breaks out. The five-minute long clip, which has quickly gone viral not only on Facebook but all across the Internet, was posted in response to the deadly workplace shooting that occurred just two days prior in nearby Orlando.

When Sherriff Ivey says “war,” he doesn’t mean a massive battle fought with ballistic missiles and nuclear bombs, but rather a war against mass shootings and deranged lunatics who are out to destroy human life. “What’s next is to fully understand that this is war, and you better be prepared to wage war to protect you, your family, and those around you if attacked,” he argued.

Sherriff Ivey went on to emphasize the fact that shooters feed off of fear, and in many ways depend on people running and hiding as opposed to standing tall and fighting back. “What they don’t count on is being attacked themselves, having to become defensive to save their own lives,” the Sherriff said. (RELATED: GUNS SAVE LIVES: Rampaging knife murderer in Minnesota mall was stopped by… guess what? A man with a concealed gun)

In the video, which currently has nearly 20,000 views, Sherriff Ivey urges citizens to train in self-defense and for those who have concealed carry permits to carry a gun on them at all times. “No matter who you are or what your position is on guns, there’s no denying the fact that the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun or a knife is an armed and well-prepared citizen or law enforcement officer,” Ivey said.

To many people, what Sherriff Ivey says in his video is just common sense. It seems as though the news media is reporting on a mass shooting every other month nowadays, and what’s worse is that there’s no way average citizens can ever see them coming. Sadly, what starts out as a normal day in the office could turn into a day of shooting and violence in the blink of an eye. Therefore, it only makes sense to do as Sherriff Ivey says — to arm up and to prepare for war.

But incredibly, some leftists and gun control advocates are attacking Sherriff Ivey’s video, calling it, among other things, “controversial.” He is also being accused of being a “fear monger” and riling up vigilantes. Indeed, most politicians in Washington DC and even some in the police force believe that arming up and preparing for war, as Sherriff Ivey says, is not the answer to gun violence. Rather, they naively think that more restrictions on firearms will make our neighborhoods and cities safer.

Leonard Papania, the police chief in Gulfport, Mississippi, is one example of a police officer who doesn’t believe citizens should be given easier access to firearms. In a piece published last year in the New York Times, authors Campbell Robertson and Timothy Williams quoted Papania as saying, “We are a gun society and we recognize that, but we should be writing gun laws that maker us safer. Do you want every incident on your street to escalate to acts of gun violence?”

With all due respect, the scenario that Police Chief Papania described last year for the New York Times is simply not accurate. The most common argument that gun control advocates use is that if we have more guns on the streets, then the United States will turn into the wild west with violent shootouts happening on every other block.

Unfortunately for the left, these arguments are nothing more than fictional scenarios stolen from 1960s western films. The fact of the matter is that when more people are allowed to carry firearms, society is generally safer. On the contrary, when strict gun laws are implemented, there are less “good guys” with guns out on the streets and more of a chance that a mass shooter will be successful.

The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution makes it clear – the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed upon.

Are we nearing civil war?

President Trump may be chief of state, head of government and commander in chief, but his administration is shot through with disloyalists plotting to bring him down.

(Article by Patrick J. Buchanan republished from LewRockwell.com)

We are approaching something of a civil war where the capital city seeks the overthrow of the sovereign and its own restoration.

Thus far, it is a nonviolent struggle, though street clashes between pro- and anti-Trump forces are increasingly marked by fistfights and brawls. Police are having difficulty keeping people apart. A few have been arrested carrying concealed weapons.

That the objective of this city is to bring Trump down via a deep state-media coup is no secret. Few deny it.

Last week, fired Director of the FBI James Comey, a successor to J. Edgar Hoover, admitted under oath that he used a cutout to leak to The New York Times an Oval Office conversation with the president.

Goal: have the Times story trigger the appointment of a special prosecutor to bring down the president.

Comey wanted a special prosecutor to target Trump, despite his knowledge, from his own FBI investigation, that Trump was innocent of the pervasive charge that he colluded with the Kremlin in the hacking of the DNC.

Comey’s deceit was designed to enlist the police powers of the state to bring down his president. And it worked. For the special counsel named, with broad powers to pursue Trump, is Comey’s friend and predecessor at the FBI, Robert Mueller.

As Newt Gingrich said Sunday: “Look at who Mueller’s starting to hire. … (T)hese are people that … look to me like they’re … setting up to go after Trump … including people, by the way, who have been reprimanded for hiding from the defense information into major cases. …

“This is going to be a witch hunt.”

Another example. According to Daily Kos, Trump planned a swift lifting of sanctions on Russia after inauguration and a summit meeting with Vladimir Putin to prevent a second Cold War.

The State Department was tasked with working out the details.

Instead, says Daniel Fried, the coordinator for sanctions policy, he received “panicky” calls of “Please, my God, can you stop this?”

Operatives at State, disloyal to the president and hostile to the Russia policy on which he had been elected, collaborated with elements in Congress to sabotage any detente. They succeeded.

“It would have been a win-win for Moscow,” said Tom Malinowski of State, who boasted last week of his role in blocking a rapprochement with Russia. State employees sabotaged one of the principal policies for which Americans had voted, and they substituted their own.

Not in memory have there been so many leaks to injure a president from within his own government, and not just political leaks, but leaks of confidential, classified and secret documents. The leaks are coming out of the supposedly secure investigative and intelligence agencies of the U.S. government.

The media, the beneficiaries of these leaks, are giving cover to those breaking the law. The real criminal “collusion” in Washington is between Big Media and the deep state, colluding to destroy a president they detest and to sink the policies they oppose.

Yet another example is the unfolding “unmasking” scandal.

While all the evidence is not yet in, it appears an abnormal number of conversations between Trump associates and Russians were intercepted by U.S. intelligence agencies.

On orders higher up, the conversations were transcribed, and, contrary to law, the names of Trump associates unmasked.

Then those transcripts, with names revealed, were spread to all 16 agencies of the intel community at the direction of Susan Rice, and with the possible knowledge of Barack Obama, assuring some would be leaked after Trump became president.

The leak of Gen. Michael Flynn’s conversation with the Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, after Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for the hacking of the DNC, may have been a product of the unmasking operation. The media hit on Flynn cost him the National Security Council post.

Trump has had many accomplishments since his election. Yet his enemies in the media and their deep state allies have often made a purgatory of his presidency.

What he and his White House need to understand is that this is not going to end, that this is a fight to the finish, that his enemies will not relent until they see him impeached or resigning in disgrace.

To prevail, Trump will have to campaign across this country and wage guerrilla war in this capital, using the legal and political weapons at his disposal to ferret out the enemies within his own government.

Not only is this battle essential, if Trump hopes to realize his agenda, it is winnable. For the people sense that the Beltway elites are cynically engaged in preserving their own privileges, positions and power.

If the president cannot rewrite Obamacare or achieve tax reform, he should not go around the country in 2018 wailing about Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer. They are not the real adversaries. They are but interchangeable parts.

He should campaign against the real enemies of America First by promising to purge the deep state and flog its media collaborators.

Time to burn down the Bastille.

Special Counsel to investigate “Russian collusion” is an orchestrated witch hunt run by the deep state to overthrow America

The longer newly appointed independent counsel and former FBI Director Robert Mueller is around, the more some in Congress, along with tens of millions of Americans who support President Donald J. Trump, are becoming suspicious of his appointment and his motives.

Case in point: GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert, himself a lawyer, a former state district and chief judge from Texas, who now believes that, given recent developments, the appointment of Mueller and the way it came about is nothing but a setup to help dump the president.

If he’s right, that means the Deep State — or, the Swamp, as Trump calls it — will have successfully overthrown the duly-elected head of the U.S. government.

As reported by Breitbart News, Gohmert appeared Tuesday on the Fox News morning program, “Fox & Friends,” in which he argued that since the country now knows there was no collusion between Team Trump and “the Russians” during the 2016 election cycle, there is no longer any need for Mueller, as there is nothing left for him to investigate.

“[W]e now know there is no collusion between the administration and Russia — so we can drop the Independent Counsel, the Special Counsel — there is no further need,” he said. Rather, he said, the focus of any investigation should be on the Justice Department, given that’s where the order for the special counsel originated (with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein) and where former FBI Director James Comey’s nefarious behavior during the last election took place.

“And we now know the collusion between Comey and Mueller,” Gohmert argued. “He ran things by Mueller before he testified. He also ran things by other people in the Justice Department when he did the memo. There is so much collusion — real collusion in the Justice Department.” (RELATED: Fair to the president? Special counsel Mueller hiring DEM donors to Obama, Hillary)

Comey did indeed meet with Mueller, about a week before the former testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, dropping a few bombshells. Also, CNN reported, oddly, that prior to Comey’s testimony, Mueller traveled to FBI headquarters to be briefed on the contents of some memos the recently fired FBI director wrote, allegedly to document conversations he had with Trump (but he didn’t keep memos during his tenure with the Obama administration).

There is also this: Comey and Mueller are not just professional colleagues, they are long-time personal friends — and that alone is a major conflict of interest in an investigation that is supposed to be “independent.” After all, if it comes down to trusting Comey or Trump, who do you think Mueller will choose?

“Bob Mueller and Jim Comey are best of friends and have been for over two decades,” said former Asst. FBI Director James Kallstrom, also the former FBI head of the New York office. “How do you appoint a special counsel who is a longtime friend? That is a massive conflict of interest.”

And even if they weren’t close friends, Kallstrom told Breitbart News this week, having one former FBI director investigate the actions of another seems like a problem as well.

But they are. How close? Garrett Graff, who wrote a book about Mueller, wrote in Politico last month that the pair remained close, with Comey considering Mueller his “mentor.”

Four years earlier, Graff also noted in a separate article for the Washingtonian that both men had a mentor as well — former Obama Attorney General Eric Holder, who also served in Bill Clinton’s Justice Department.

There’s more. Lifezette reported Tuesday that Mueller is filling his ranks with Left-wing lawyers who have financially supported Obama and Hillary Clinton. One, “Jeannie Rhee, also worked as a lawyer for the Clinton Foundation and helped persuade a federal judge to block a conservative activist’s attempts to force Bill and Hillary Clinton to answer questions under oath about operations of the family-run charity,” the site noted.

Says Gohmert: “[Mueller] needs to recuse himself from this matter. We don’t need a special counsel. That was a ruse, once again, by the dishonest Comey,” who told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he purposefully leaked one of his Trump memos specifically to help trigger the appointment of a special counsel.

He’s not alone. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., smells a rat, too. He tweeted out earlier this week his suspicions:

Republicans are delusional if they think the special counsel is going to be fair. Look who he is hiring.check fec reports. Time to rethink. — Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) June 12, 2017

This whole thing is looking suspiciously like a set-up. Before it gets out of hand, Trump may need to fire Mueller too, which he is constitutionally able to do.

(Natural News) Although suddenly everyone is aware of the looming financial collapse of the State of Illinois, almost no one is aware of why it’s actually happening. And the lying mainstream media — purveyors of fake news — won’t dare tell you the real truth: Illinois is being bankrupted by Big Pharma and the failed “sick care” medical establishment.

With a current payables backlog of $15 billion it owes to contractors that include “sick care” providers, Illinois also owes $251 billion in future pension benefits that include health care coverage. That’s a quarter of a trillion dollars for a state that is so far beyond broke that even mainstream news organizations are calling its financial situation “catastrophic.”

On top of that, a recent court ruling demands the state now pay $586 million per month to catch up on all the unpaid Medicaid bills it owes doctors, hospitals, cancer clinics and drug companies. State comptroller Susana Mendoza says, “Friday’s ruling would cause her to likely have to cut payments to the state’s pension funds, state payroll or payments to local governments,” according to the Chicago Tribune. “As if the governor and legislators needed any more reason to compromise and settle on a comprehensive budget plan immediately, Friday’s ruling by the U.S. District Court takes the state’s finances from horrific to catastrophic,” said Mendoza.

Like all the other states, Illinois has flushed billions down the toilet to enrich Big Pharma’s failed “sick care” treatments

The real reason Illinois is going broke is because the health care system in America is technically a legal drug cartel … a profiteering monopoly that transfers economic wealth from the citizens to the pockets of drug companies.

A literal conspiracy across the FDA and state medical boards criminalizes natural medicine while pushing high-priced prescription drugs that cure nothing and only guarantee repeat business for the pharma drug cartels. The result is a massive, nationwide “wealth extraction” operation run by the drug companies, and Illinois is just the first of many states that will financially crumble under the burden of monopoly-priced medicine that fails to prevent disease in the first place.

Even as we’re watching Illinois implode under the financial burden of a failed health care system, almost no one is talking about the real source of the problem: The drug cartels and their monopoly over medicine. In the same way that Colombia was transformed into a “narco state” in the 1980s by the lucrative cocaine trade cocaine, today’s United States of America has collapsed into a “pharma state” where drug company interests dominate the politics.

To save America, we must declare independence from Big Pharma’s drug cartels

America spends almost one out of every four dollars of its GDP on “sick care” services. This is largely money that’s spent on a broken health care system dominated by Big Pharma’s toxic drugs that simply don’t work to prevent sickness and disease. This disastrous drug cartel serves only to transfer wealth from the population to the pockets of drug company shareholders and CEOs, and if America is to financially survive, it must reject this failed system of unaffordable, toxic medicine.

The FDA’s federally-enforced drug monopoly must end, and we as a nation must legalize natural medicine for everyone, including protecting doctors and health practitioners who wish to prescribe natural medicine to their patients (but will currently lose their medical licenses if they attempt such things).

The primary enforcer of the toxic pharmaceutical cartels that are bankrupting America — the FDA — must be gutted from top to bottom. The agency serves as nothing but a drug-pushing protection racket enforcer, targeting natural medicine manufacturers for destruction while colluding with drug companies to keep dangerous, costly prescription medications widely available even when they are killing hundreds of thousands of Americans each year. Thanks to the FDA, for example, prescription opioid deaths have now surpassed all gun-related deaths in America. The result is the acceleration toward bankruptcy at every level of our economy: Cities, states and even nations are facing imminent financial collapse because they’ve spent fortunes on monopoly-priced medications that have accomplished nothing other than enriching the Big Pharma drug cartel.

When a single state in America must now pay over half a billion dollars per month just to barely keep up with what it owes the medical system, you know something has gone terribly wrong and the system is unsustainable.

Big Pharma is a dangerous parasite on the U.S. economy and it will bankrupt everything if we don’t stop it. All the Republican talk about health care reform and “free market” solutions is just smoke and mirrors unless you address the pharma drug cartels and the FDA-enforced monopoly that criminalizes natural medicine, a safe, affordable and highly effective alternative to toxic prescription medications.

In fact, I’ll make a bold prediction here: Any state or nation that does not free itself from the economic death grip of the pharma drug cartels will eventually face financial collapse. Paying more and more money to a monopoly-protected corporate monstrosity that sells toxic chemicals to sick people is not merely unsustainable, it is stupid beyond belief. Yet this remains the default plan of both Republicans and Democrats in Washington, nearly all of whom are prostitutes for the pharmaceutical industry.

Listen to my podcast videos to learn more details about why the Big Pharma drug cartels are so dangerous to America:

(Natural News) CNN, once the leader in cable news, is now the leader in crybully journalism. After fabricating fake news to smear Donald Trump — and getting caught — CNN is now crying and whining that it’s the victim in all this.

I call it “crybully journalism,” and it’s the same style of putrid, passive-aggressive journalism you find on parade at MSNBC, NBC, the Washington Post and the New York Times. Across the board, all these media outlets smear, defame and demean President Trump, Sarah Palin, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh and every conservative in sight. Then, the minute somebody punches back, they cry “victim.” (See more examples of left-wing crybully psychology at Crybullies.news.)

What they really want, you see, is a president who will just sit there and be abused, smeared and slandered by the media without responding in any way whatsoever. This, the media says, is known as being “presidential.” When Obama, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Harry Reid and Mike & Joe deliberately lie, demean, insult and slander prominent Republicans, that’s all okay with the left-wing media, but the minute somebody gives these sociopathic Democrats a dose of their own medicine, they cry foul.

But Trump isn’t going to be the insane left-wing media’s punching back. Trump is re-defining “presidential” to mean, finally, refusing to be the media’s whipping boy. That’s why everyone in America who isn’t a brainwashed, indoctrinated Rachel Maddow groupie is loving every minute of Donald Trump fighting back against the corrupt, dishonest, abusive and wildly FAKE “mainstream” media.

That’s why, when Trump tweeted out this hilarious video of him body slamming CNN to the ground, much of the country cheered with laughter:

Four podcasts that expose the fakery and treason of CNN

I’ve posted four podcasts that expose the outright fakery, anti-Americanism and treason of CNN, a tabloid fake news network staffed by treasonous traitors who despise America, democracy and the voters. You can hear all these (and more) at the Health Ranger Report podcast site.

First, here’s my take on how CNN has become the leader in “crybully journalism.”

Here’s how James O’Keefe and Project Veritas are spearheading what I call “the collapse of bulls##t” and the exposing of CNN’s totally fake news:

In this podcast, I reveal how President Trump can instantly de-fund CNN and collapse the lying “mainstream” media:

And finally, here’s why believing CNN may literally get you killed. Not only is watching CNN one of the most stupid things you can do to yourself, it’s also dangerous to your survival:

The internet is full of advice on eating ethically and sustainably, and how to be more responsible as a food shopper. After all, we are all accountable for the state of the planet, its people, and all living creatures on it. But can making ethical and earth-friendly food choices really be a realistic way of life for the average family? There’s no denying that the free range and organic route is a much healthier lifestyle option – but is it affordable? Can someone on low-middle income really afford to choose grass fed beef over grain fed? Or can they confidently select organic fruit and veg over regular vegetables without blowing their weekly budget?

There are many ways we can eat more ethically and sustainably as responsible citizens of this earth, but it’s about finding the most cost-effective ways to do so that matter for most. Otherwise, the dream of creating a better, fairer world is an ideology that only the rich can really indulge. So what are the ways to keep organic, free range and fair trade as obtainable as possible? Here are some tips on shopping responsibly on a budget.

Buy Fruit & Veg in Season

Getting in season fruits and vegetables is a great way of saving money on groceries. But lower prices aren’t the only thing that will tempt you into sticking with this golden rule. Seasonal veggies will taste much better at the right time of year. And letting green grocer availability guide you will ensure that you have a colourful, well-rounded and varied diet throughout the seasons.

Freeze, Preserve & Pickle

Another rule of eating sustainably is to reduce food waste. Leftover vegetables and fruits should never be discarded. Some freezer friendly fresh foods can be stored away for future recipes, whilst others are best for jams, preserves or pickles. And don’t forget the sauces – from homemade salsa and pasta sauces to vegetable gravy, there are so many creative ways to make your food last longer.

Use the Whole Animal

When it comes to meat, choosing grass fed and pasture fed is the most ethical option for the animal. It’s also better for the British landscape, and pasture-reared meats such as beef are found to contain less fat and have more nutrients such as omega-3, calcium, magnesium, and potassium. But good meat comes at a price. To make your money go further, ask for more cost friendly cuts and don’t let parts of the animal go to waste. Some butchers will give away pork rinds (can be made into pork scratchings), suet (can be rendered into cooking fat) and bones (can be used in soups and stocks) for free.

Stick to Homemade

One of the cheapest ways to eat well is to stick with homemade and home baked. Buying organic readymade foods (such as ready meals, sauces and baked goods) can be pricey so if you can source the ingredients yourself, give it a go. A breakmaker can make baking easy and accessible, whilst organic sauce recipes are readily available online.

Try Home Grown

It’s often the little things that really add up at the supermarket. So having a home grown herb garden or vegetable patch will help to keep your fridge stocked up for those impromptu recipes. If you’re worried about initial cost outlay or time, try a herb garden first as these are relatively easy to maintain and are not expensive to keep.

When it comes to weight loss, you are oftentimes your own worst enemy. Indeed, many people on this journey miss their goals by unknowingly sabotaging their own efforts, either by eating or exercising wrong. Unfortunately, when they don’t see the results they want on the scale, they often abandon the endeavor altogether.

Want to avoid the same fate? Be sure to avoid these common mistakes.

Too much, too soon

A lot of people make the mistake of drastically changing their diets from the word “go.” Oftentimes, this means quitting things like carbs and sugar cold-turkey, as well as aggressively cutting down the amount of calories they consume. Furthermore, they also tend to be overzealous with their workouts, spending hours each day in the gym.

While such enthusiasm is certainly admirable, the kind of rigor you put yourself under is most likely unsustainable. The more you deprive yourself, the higher the probability that you will “relapse” and binge eat at the first temptation. Remember, weight loss is a marathon, not a sprint. You need to find a system that will be sustainable for you in the long run.

This is why you should start slow. Begin by reducing your consumption of so-called guilty foods until you phase them out completely. Or, replace favorites such as coffee with healthier alternatives that contain fat-loss enhancing ingredients.

Going overboard on cheat days

Finally managed to run an hour straight? Great job on your endurance training! While such an achievement is definitely worth celebrating, try not to do so with food. Indeed, many people reward themselves way too much during their “cheat” days.

A reward every so often is more than fine, but the only danger with having cheat days is that it’s so easy to go overboard. A slice of cake quickly turns into two, and before you know it you’ve obliterated the calorie deficit you’ve worked all week to create.

A better mindset is to have cheat meals where you get to enjoy one treat and one treat only for that day. It’s more sustainable to have one to two cheat meals within the week, instead of waiting to have a smorgasbord. Limiting cheats to one meal also makes it easier to keep track of your calorie consumption.

Not knowing your calorie intake

You work out regularly, but you still can’t lose the excess pounds? If this sounds like you, you better take a closer look at your calorie intake—you may be eating way more calories that you initially thought.

In fact, let’s do a little experiment: How many calories do you think are in a tablespoon of vegetable oil? If you’re like most people, you’d probably answer about 50 calories. The real answer: 120 calories!

As you can see, many dieters are often unaware of how many calories they’re actually eating, which is why they often overeat unwittingly. A good rule of thumb is to always look at a product’s nutrition label before consuming it. Or, if you’re cooking your own meals, look up a recipe’s calorie content online to get a general sense of its energy value.

You don’t eat enough

Yes, creating a calorie deficit is the goal of all weight loss programs, and it is most often achieved by eating a little less than you’re used to. However, some people go overboard with their dieting and consume only the bare minimum of 1200 calories to hasten the weight loss.

Yes, you may be able to drastically reduce your weight using this strategy, but you’ll no doubt be miserable the entire time. What’s more, it’s only effective up to a certain degree. Depriving your body of too much calories will cause it to enter starvation mode. Here, your metabolism slows to a crawl. When this happens, your body clamps downs on your metabolic rate, so while you may be dieting and eating as healthily as possible, you still won’t drop the pounds.

To ensure safe and effective weight loss, make sure to eat about 500 calories less than your recommended energy intake. Doing so over the course of a week will cause you to lose 3,500 calories in total—the same amount of calories as one pound of fat.

Not drinking enough water

Hydration is vital to your overall well-being, and it can even help improve your athletic performance during workouts. However, not getting enough water can also make you more likely to snack—and gain weight. This is because the body often confuses thirst signals for hunger. That’s why you get cravings even if you’d just had a full meal. The next time that you feel your tummy growling, reach for a glass of water instead of a bag of chips. Not only will water help you feel fuller, it will also assist many bodily functions including nutrient absorption and facilitating energy expenditure.

You’re only doing cardio

Cardio is an excellent form of exercise if you wish to lose weight. All it requires is a good pair of running shoes and good old-fashioned will power. That being said, don’t rely on it as your sole form of physical activity—when you’re down to your last 5-10 pounds, cardio might not be able to help you anymore.

If you really want to get that fit body you desire, considering combining cardio with some weight training. Lifting weights increases your body’s muscle mass, and muscles happen to be very metabolically active, meaning they require more calories to sustain. In effect, the more muscles you have, the faster your metabolism.

Now, there will be ladies out there who shun weightlifting because they think it’ll make them look like a bodybuilder. This couldn’t farther from the truth! The increased muscle mass will only replace the fat you lost, giving your body a tighter and firmer look.

The most crucial part of any weight loss program is getting started. But if you’re not careful, it’s very easy to lose your way. Hopefully, the tips and tricks above will keep you on the right track until you finally meet your ultimate goal.

For so long, we’ve been conditioned to think our genes are rigid and unchangeable; and they alone define our health and longevity. We expect chronic disease to be treated like the common cold. Take a pill and go back to work.

You can’t fix obesity or diabetes with a pill; some pills (like statin drugs) actually raise your risk of developing diabetes or having a heart attack, and if you consume the typical American diet that consists of over one hundred pounds of refined white sugar and corn syrup per year—you are actually enabling diabetes. And for diabetics who have been conditioned to think diet sodas and artificial sugar will keep your blood sugar stable—think again. Sugar substitutes are toxic chemicals that kill your nerves. Literally—it excites them to death.

We have been deliberately conditioned to look to someone outside ourselves for answers—when all we really need to do is look within. In ancient times, we had our tribe, our family, and our community. We passed our inherited knowledge from generation to generation, and everything that brought us joy, that healed us, that made us wiser and stronger—is encoded within our DNA. We must simply remember.

If you’re old enough to remember the incredibly popular “Marlboro Man” television advertisement campaign (1955-1999), you remember those smokin’ hot cowboys—that showed us that filtered cigarettes weren’t just for martini sipping housewives. When the ads first appeared in 1955, sales were $5 billion. Two years later, they were $20 billion. If you remember, those scientific studies on safety of smoking, conducted by none other than the same Phillip Morris tobacco company who sold the cigarettes—“PROVED” that smoking didn’t cause lung cancer. Of course, the studies were scientific– those trusted nighttime news anchors that reported the results wouldn’t lie to us. And then five of the cowboy ad “hunks” died of cancer and smoking related lung diseases. There were six total. Cigarettes became known as the “Cowboy Killers.” And maybe—just maybe the science was a little skewed—since the tobacco company had a huge stake in the outcome. And then we learned that even second hand smoke was bad for us. Remember coming home from a restaurant and your clothes and hair smelled like an ashtray?

But we learned our lesson didn’t we? We no longer blindly believe pseudo science, paid for and conducted by tobacco companies to sell us cancer-causing cigarettes; or pharmaceutical companies to sell us cancer drugs that give us cancer; or foods laden with pesticides that poison our gut. We learned right? And after all, we now have legit TV doctors to explain the latest research so we can trust the validity of new drugs and food safety.

We. Learned. Right?

The study of immunology is relatively new. Just a couple decades ago—no one understood the importance of the gut micro biome in the prevention of chronic disease. You could say the greatest predictor of true immune system health is the state of the gut. Trust it! The antibodies in your immune system contain the memory of all the diseases that your ancestors overcame. Everything you need to know is already inside you—made possible by the evolution of cellular DNA memory and your mother’s breast milk.

What thousands of epigenetic studies have taught us, is that merely possessing a specific gene, does not guarantee the expression of it. Telomeres are DNA pieces at the end of chromosomes that act as protective end caps. Every time a cell divides, the chromosome end cap gets shorter. Once a chromosome gets too short, it dies. This process has been associated with rapid aging and death. We now have the science to show that people who consistently maintain high levels of physical activity have significantly longer telomeres than those with a sedentary lifestyle. High physical activity gives you a biological aging advantage of nine years over those who are sedentary! (Study listed below)

Lifestyle choices can engage our cells to perform at their peak. All of us can consciously choose to engage in behaviors that enable our genes to heal us, not harm us.

In the words of Deepak Chopra and Rudi Tanzi:

“You will always have the genes you were born with, but genes are dynamic, responding to everything we think, say, and do. Suddenly they’ve become our strongest allies for personal transformation. When you make lifestyle choices that optimize how your genes behave, you can reach for a state of health and fulfillment undreamed of even a decade ago. The impact on prevention, immunity, diet, aging, and chronic disorders is unparalleled.” (From the book, Super Genes, link below—highly recommend)

Anti-aging Tips You’ll Need To Know If You Want To Live To Be 100

Do you know any centenarians so you can ask them their anti-aging tips? (And no, that’s not a mythical creature.) I bet you don’t.

It’s a human who has blown out 100 candles on their birthday cake. They’ve seen over 100 summers within their lifetime. They’ve probably voted in more elections, seen more political upheavals, and lived through more economic roller-coasters than we could ever fathom. Because they’re one hundred years old.

More than likely, you’ve never met one before. Because centenarians are very rare in modern America.

The percentage of Americans who reach their one hundred milestones is only 0.02% of the population. That’s about 55,000 people. So if it’s so rare, what can you do to make it into the centenarian club? And do you really want to make the club if you’re going to be mentally ill, or even physically ill?

I know for my own personal goals, living to be one hundred did not even make my top ten list. To live to be 80, and still be sharp minded, physically fit, and die peacefully in my sleep would be a win in my books.

But maybe I’m just an underachiever. Maybe I should reach for the stars in my quest to break the record books as the oldest living American. And to be honest, I do love a challenge.

So it’s settled! I’m going to try to live to be one hundred.

Therefore, with the idea in mind that you want to live to be one hundred, too–because why else would you be reading this blog post?

I will detail the three steps in a series of blog posts detailing the steps necessary to fulfill our dreams. (I may throw in a bonus at the end if I feel you’ve been good enough to earn it.) This post will detail Tip #1.

Anti-Aging Tip #1: Eat High-Quality Food

Most of you reading this would think, well, duh! Of course, you would need high-quality nutrition in order to reach 100 years of age. If you aren’t sure about this fact, please read more blog posts on Natural News. They will help you get up to speed.

Since you desire to reach 100, you eat organic whenever possible, right? (If you don’t, you really should. It not only tastes better but doesn’t have carcinogenic weed killer sprayed on it.)

Not only do you eat organic, but I would imagine GMOs are not even given access to your pie hole, right? As much as possible, you eat good food, and your grocery bill proves it. Eating healthy is expensive.

But what if I was to tell you that there’s a people group, called the Hunzas, who grow only what they eat, totally organic, 100% non-GMO, and they generally live to be an extremely healthy and active 130 years old.

Yep, you read that right. That was not a typo. One hundred and thirty years old.

That was not a typo. One hundred and thirty years old.

One.Hundred.And.Thirty.Years.Old.

How do they live to be 130?!

So if they eat non-GMO, organic food, like us health food nuts here in America, why aren’t we living to be 130? It’s the soil in which they grow their food. It’s black gold.

Evidently, their longevity secret is the rich soil in which they grow their food. Maybe not rich using the same standards as “The Beverly Hillbillies”. You know the song. (It goes like this: “Well, let me tell you a story ’bout a man named Jed. The poor mountaineer barely kept his family fed. And then one day he was shooting at some food, and up through the ground came bubbling crude. Oil that is. Black gold. Texas ‘T'”).

You know the TV jingle. (If you not sure what jingle I mean, it goes like this: “Well, let me tell you a story ’bout a man named Jed. The poor mountaineer barely kept his family fed. And then one day he was shooting at some food, and up through the ground came bubbling crude. Oil that is. Black gold. Texas ‘T'”).

No, the Hunzas had a different kind of “rich” soil.

Living like a Hunza

The Hunzas live at the base of the Himalayas and for most of the centuries of their existence have been completely isolated from outside civilization. In the 1930’s, their community became a scientific anomaly, as the men were fathering children into their late 90’s and early 100’s. They lived, on average, to be 120-130 years old, and didn’t suffer debilitating diseases such as cancer, diabetes, dementia, or Alzheimer’s. In fact, they didn’t even have words in their language to translate the diseases from English to their native tongue.

In fact, they didn’t even have the words in their language to translate these diseases from English to their native tongue.

To the researchers who studied them, they were astonished at how youthful the fifty-year-olds looked, and at how active the centenarians were.

When the Hunzas finally depart this blue planet and head for their final resting place, they almost always pass away in their sleep.

Peacefully. Without any sign of disease.

So why do they eat organic and non-GMO and are rewarded with such great results? It’s got to be their genes, right? Wrong.

“Civilization” encroaches upon Utopia

In the late 1970’s some genius (sarcasm here) decided the Hunzas needed a road to connect their incredibly remote Utopia with the rest of the world. Soon after construction was complete, a new type of construction began. The building of modern commerce began, and all the trappings it entails.

Almost instantaneously, upon the introduction of commercially farmed foods, along with processed foods laden with white sugar, white flour, and preservatives, the Hunzas began to suffer from the diseases so common in the modern world.

Gone were the days of fathering children at 107 years of age. Dementia, prostate cancer, and erectile dysfunction due to diabetes and circulation problems began to ravage the men. Women experienced hormonal issues and PMS, uterine cancer, and miscarriages at rates never seen before. I am sure their language scrambled to add the new words needed to describe their new-found ailments.

Anti-aging Tip #2: Garden Like A Hunza

At this point in our story, I should mention how they farmed. The practices used for centuries before they were “civilized” by the modern conveniences the road brought to their community.

In the valley where they lived, nestled between the mountains of the Himalayas, they plowed the land and planted seeds harvested from last season’s crop. Of course, the seeds were of an heirloom variety. And, of course, they used only natural fertilizers.

Every home had its own garden, as there were no grocery stores, and they would have died of starvation if they wouldn’t have grown their own food.

Every home had its own compost pile. All scraps, whether it was the leftovers from their meals, leaves and grass from their land, or manure from themselves and their animals, it was composted daily.

Nothing was wasted, and the land was continually replenished. Their food was highly nutritious, organic, non-GMO, and harvested from healthy farmland.

Our food, regardless of the labels in the grocery store, is lacking. And until we find a nice garden spot on our own “piece of dirt” to raise our own food in the same manner as the Hunzas, we’re going to continue to suffer from our modern day illnesses.

So grab your implements, fledgling farmers! And go make yourself a garden!

And check back soon to find the next two blog posts in our series of “How To Live Like A Hunza”.

Castor oil is often overlooked for its benefits for the skin and hair because of its extremely thick and sticky consistency. However, if you’re looking for a cheap, natural remedy for several common skin and hair complaints, then castor oil is definitely worth your time.

Castor oil for regrowing and thickening hair, eyelashes and eyebrows

I first stumbled on castor oil as a remedy for regrowing thin eyebrows. I had over-plucked my brows back in the nineties when it was the hip thing to have pencil thin brows, and they never did quite recover. It became necessary for me to pencil in the “bald” spots and I missed the natural look of real hair where these spots were missing.

I read about castor oil as a remedy for thinning brows and hair, and thought I’d try it. I bought a hexane free, organic and cold pressed castor oil and started applying it to my eyebrows every night after washing my face. After about three months, I noticed my brows were noticeably thicker (and they seemed to be growing in darker as well), and attributed it to the nightly application of castor oil.

I’m not the only one that this has worked for. So, why would castor oil help you regrow hair – both on your head and the other two important places, the eyebrows and the eyelashes.

Castor oil is high in ricinoleic acid. This acid is a very effective natural anti-bacterial and anti-fungal agent. This can help keep any fungus or bacteria from inhibiting hair growth. Since the oil is also very thick, it may help to prevent hair loss simply by helping to coat the hair and protect it from falling out.

Castor oil is also high in omega 9 fatty acids, which are nourishing to both the hair and the follicle, as well as the surrounding skin. Castor oil has a unique ability to be deeply penetrating, and this helps it to deliver its nourishment deeply into the pores and the follicles that produce hair.

It also has a high gloss, so it lends a lush glossiness and shine to the hair. A little goes a long way, and it is best to only add a tiny bit to the very ends of your hair instead of putting it up near the scalp if you’re just looking for a natural hair smoother.

Simply put about two drops on your hands and rub, then smooth through the ends. If you use too much, there is a fine line between subtle shine and a heavy greasiness so go very light until you figure out the amount that works right for your hair type.

If you’re looking to regrow the hair on your head, you can use castor oil as a scalp treatment. However it can be tricky to get on the scalp without thinning it out with a lighter oil. You can add some melted coconut oil, apricot kernel oil or another lighter oil to help get it spreadable enough.

If you’re simply looking to help thicken hair that is thinning at the edges of your hairline, you can use pure castor oil, with a light hand of course. Another use is to apply the oil to eyelashes to help thicken and strengthen them, as well as to help prevent thinning and shedding.

Castor oil for scar tissue reduction and shiny, smooth lips

Many attest to the wonders castor oil offers for keloid types of scars and other scars that involve a lot of hardened scar tissue. This is presumably due to its ability for deep penetration through multiple skin layers.

Because castor oil softens the skin so much, the thought is that this softening helps to break down deep scar tissue so it may be smoothed out. In addition, castor oil has shown promise as a white blood cell stimulating agent. Studies have also shown that castor bean oil helps reduce the inflammatory response in subcutaneous tissue. This may be why it seems to speed wound healing, and may also contribute to its ability to reduce scarring more quickly.

Castor oil is also excellent for the lips. Our lips needs constant protection against the elements. Although our lips regenerate and recover quickly, they also dry out and begin to peel when they are dehydrated.

Castor oil not only smooths the lips with fatty acids, but it also helps protect them due to its naturally thick and immovable nature. In other words, it doesn’t budge without being wiped off. It also imparts a natural shine to the lips, which makes it ideal for both improving the appearance and health of the lips.

Danna Norek is the founder of AuraSensory.com, which offers a line of natural body, skin and hair care products. The Herb Mint Citrus lip balm uses castor oil as one of the primary ingredients to add shine, moisture and protection to the lips (all naturally flavored). Line also includes a Natural Shine Enhancing Shampoo (sulfate free), Deep Hydration Conditioner, natural deodorant and a popular MSM and Vitamin C Face Cream.

If you are looking for an easy trick to improve your life and overall health, than look no further. Drinking lemon water first thing in the morning is a pretty simple routine to get into and will have tremendous effects on your overall health.

Since I started this simple and surprisingly healthy habit a few years ago, I definitely noticed the difference. Not only does the refreshing taste wake me up in the morning, it helps to kick start digestion and finalizes my body’s natural detoxification processes… And lemons are packed with vitamin C, B, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, enzymes, antioxidants, and fibers.

According to the Ayurvedic philosophy, choices you make regarding your daily routine either build up resistance to diseases or tear it down.

So what are you waiting for to jump start your day with this incredible easy morning routine. Its benefits are endless and I listed the 15 most important ones for you in this article.

1. Improves Digestion

Lemon juice has a similar structure to your stomach’s juices and helps to loosen and flush out toxins from the digestive tract. Lemon juice can help ease indigestion, heartburn, and bloating. It also helps to move your bowels in the morning, hydrates your colon, stimulate bile production, and infuses water in your stool.

2. Boost Immune System.

Lemon juice is rich in vitamin C, which helps strengthen the immunes system and fights cold and flu. But not only vitamin C is important for a good working immune system, iron is another important nutrient, and lemons improve the ability to absorb more iron from the food you eat.

3. Hydrates Your Body

It is important to stay hydrated. Especially during the summer months. Plain water is best, but many people find this boring and are not drinking enough of it. That’s where lemon comes into play to make things more interesting. So feel free to not only start your day with lemon water, but drink as many glasses as you wish during the day to stay hydrated.

4. Boost Energy

Lemon water gives you an instant boost of energy and improves your mood right at the start of your day.

5. Promote Healthy And Rejuvenated Skin

Lemons are a rich sources of antioxidants that prevent free radical damage. These free radicals are responsible for pre-mature aging of your skin. Vitamin C helps to maintain your skin’s elasticity to prevent the formation of wrinkles and decrease blemishes.

6. Reduce Inflammation

Lemons have the ability to remove uric acid from your joints. Uric acid built-ups are one of the major causes of inflammation.

7. Weight Loss Aid

Although lemon water on its own is no weight loss miracle, it can definitely help you to achieve faster and long term results. Lemons assist in fighting hunger cravings, boost metabolism, and give you a stuffed feeling, making it less likely to snack in between meals.

8. Alkalize Your Body

Although lemons have a sour taste, they are one of the most alkalizing food sources on Earth. Too much acids can cause inflammation, obesity, and major diseases like cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer’s. Click here to learn more about the importance of alkalizing your body.

9. Cleansing Properties

Lemons help your entire body to flush out more toxins to prevent built-ups and damage to your cells, tissues, and organs. It stimulates your liver to produce more enzymes and work more efficiently. Lemon juice works as a diuretic to keep your urinary tract toxin-free and can also change the pH levels which discourage bacterial growth. This is very helpful for people who often suffer from UTI (urinary tract infection). And like mentioned before, lemons loosen and flush out waste from your digestive tract and cleanse your colon.

10.Antibacterial and Antiviral Properties

Lemons have antibacterial and antiviral properties. They help fight the flu, cold, and soothe a sore throat. Although people who drink their daily lemon water every day are less likely to get these in the first place.

11.Reduce Mucus And Phlegm

Lemon water helps to reduce mucus and phlegm formation. People who drink cow’s milk are often more sensitive for mucus production. So starting your day with lemon water can definitely help to lessen mucus if you’re not ready to go dairy-free.

12.Freshen Breath

Lemons freshen your breath and fight mouth bacteria. Although lemons are great for your overall oral health, avoid drinking or using it undiluted. The citric acid can erode tooth enamel, so don’t brush your teeth with it, but have a glass of lemon water instead.

13.Boost Brain Power

The high levels of potassium and magnesium show beneficial effects on our brain and nerve health. Lemon water can give you the boost you need to fight depression and stress. It creates mental clarity and more focus, making it a great drink for students or people with busy and stressful jobs.

14.Anti-cancer

Lemon’s antioxidants not only protect your skin from ageing, but also reduce the risk of several types of cancer. They are great in neutralizing acids as well. Cancer loves to grow in an acidic environment. Alkalizing your body may stop cancer cells to grow and may reduce the risk of getting cancer in the first place.

15.Get Of Caffeine

Many people are able to get off caffeine by replacing their morning coffee by lukewarm lemon water. It gives a similar energy boost to wake your body and boost energy as one cup of coffee would.

How To Make Lemon Water

Making lemon water is super simple. It takes less than 5 minutes of your precious morning time. Just squeeze half a lemon in lukewarm water. If you weigh more than 150 pounds, use a whole lemon.

Why use lukewarm (or room temperature) instead of cold or hot water to make this healing morning drink? Well, hot or cold water takes more energy to process, so your first glass in the morning should be lukewarm or at room temperature to slowly wake your body and kick start digestion.

If you love the taste feel free to add more lemon water to your diet during the rest of the day, cold or hot. It adds up to your daily water need, is less boring than plain water, and adds tons of benefits for body and mind.

Our kidneys are super important for our health. They filter our blood, produce hormones, absorb minerals, produce urine, eliminate toxins, and neutralize acids. So as one of the most important organs in your body, your kidneys deserve some love.

Damage or steady decline of your kidneys can often go unnoticed for years as your kidneys can still do their job with as little as 20% of their capacity. Therefore kidney diseases are often referred to as “The Silent Diseases”. That’s why it is so important to take care of them before it is too late.

Here’s a list of 10 common habits that put a lot of pressure on your kidneys and can cause serious damage over time.

1. Not Drinking Enough Water

Your kidney’s most important function is to filter blood and eliminate toxins and waste materials. When you don’t drink enough plain water during the day toxins and waste material start to accumulate and can cause severe damage to your body.

2. Too Much Salt In Your Diet

Your body needs sodium or salt to work properly. Most people however consume too much salt which may raise blood pressure and put a lot of stress on the kidneys. As a good rule of thumb, no more than 5 grams of salt should be eaten on a daily basis.

3. Frequently Delaying The Call Of Nature

Many of us ignore the urge to go because they are too busy or want to avoid public bathrooms. Retaining urine on a regular basis increases urine pressure and can lead to kidney failure, kidney stones, and incontinence. So listen to your body when nature calls.

4. Kick The Sugar Habit

Scientific studies show that people who consume 2 or more sugary drinks a day are more likely to have protein in their urine. Having protein in your urine is an early sign your kidneys are not doing their job as they should.

5. Vitamin And Mineral Deficiencies

Eating a clean, whole food diet full of fresh vegetables and fruits is important for your overall health and a good kidney function. Many deficiencies can increase the risk of kidney stones or kidney failure. Vitamin B6 and magnesium, for instance, are super important to reduce the risk of kidney stones.

An estimated 70 to 80 percent of Americans isn’t getting enough magnesium, so there may be a good chance that you are one of them. Click here to learn more about magnesium deficiencies.

6. Too Much Animal Protein

Over consumption of protein, especially red meat, increases the metabolic load on your kidneys. So more protein in your diet means your kidneys have to work harder and this can lead to kidney damage or dysfunction over time.

7. Sleep Deprivation

We have all heard how important it is to get a good night’s rest. Chronic sleep deprivation is linked to many diseases and kidney diseases are also on the list. During the night your body repairs damaged kidney tissue, so give your body the time to heal and repair itself.

8. Coffee Habit

Just as salt, caffeine can raise blood pressure and put extra stress on your kidneys. Over time excessive consumption of coffee can cause damage to your kidneys.

9. Painkiller Abuse

Way too many people take painkillers for their small aches and pains, while there are many all-natural, safe remedies available. Excessive use or painkiller abuse can lead to severe damage of liver and kidneys.

10. Alcohol Consumption

Although there is nothing wrong with enjoying a glass of wine or having a beer once in a while, most of us don’t stop after just one drink. Alcohol is actually a legal toxin that puts a lot of stress on our kidneys and liver.

To stay healthy and avoid kidney issues it is important to eat lots of fresh, whole foods and if you keep the above information in mind and avoid these common habits as much as possible, your kidneys will not be under constant stress and your body will thank you for that.

In America, almost one in three adults are living with high blood pressure, that’s why the topic of dietary recommendations for high blood pressure is becoming more and more popular these days. What causes high blood pressure? Normally not consuming enough vegetables and fruits can result in a high sodium intake and low potassium intake, which can contribute to developing high blood pressure. So with high blood pressure, you are recommended to have a diet low in sodium and fat, avoid these foods:

Pickles

Pickles are super low in calories and fat, and are also high in vitamin K, which helps your blood clot after the injury, that’s great. But they are loaded with sodium, one medium pickle provides more than 570mg of sodium, that’s more than 1/3 of the daily recommended needs. So if you’re with high blood pressure, limit your pickle intake.

Sauerkraut

Sauerkraut is with several health benefits, including providing vitamin C and K, iron and a good amount of fiber, and it also boosts your immune system, but you should limit the amount you eat, or choose low-sodium brands, as a half cup of it has more than 460 mg of sodium, 19% of your recommended daily intake.

Bacon

Bacon is not only delicious, it’s also like other pork products, contains B-vitamins (vitamin B1, B2, B3, B6, B12), vitamin D as well as the minerals zinc, iron and magnesium, which are all essential for a positive health body. But why most people feel afraid to eat it? As it’s super high in sodium, three slices contain around 270 mg of sodium and 4.5 grams of fat, so it’s wise to try turkey bacon for lower sodium intake instead of the salty&fatty pork bacon.

Whole Milk

When you’re trying to build muscle, whole milk is your best choice, it provides more fat than you need, a one cup serving of whole milk contains 8 grams of fat. While if you are living with high blood pressure, try using 2% milk, or even better-skim milk, as the saturated fats whole milk contains are bad for you and may lead to heart disease.

Donuts

People like donuts, for its sweet taste, but they are not good for your health. A single donut can provide more than 300 calories and 12 grams of fat, as they’re fried, means you’re getting lots of saturated and trans fat, which can increase your risk of heart disease.

Ramen Noodles

Ramen noodles are popular among college students all over the world, as they’re inexpensive and so convenient. However, it’s not a healthy choice as they’re lack of nutrients and with lots of unhealthy components. One package of ramen provides 14 grams of fat, including 6 grams of saturated fat, and 1731 grams of sodium, more than 70% of the recommended daily needs! In fact, the flavor packet contains most of the sodium, so to reduce sodium intake, it’s better to not add the flavor packet.

Alcohol

Drinking too much alcohol may raise your blood pressure to unhealthy levels, and alcohol can damage the walls of blood vessels. For people with high blood pressure, avoid alcohol totally or drink in moderation. Moderate drinking is generally considered to be:

One drink for men age more than 65 per day

Two drinks for men younger than age 65 per day

One drink for women of any age per day

A drink is 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof distilled spirits.

If you have high blood pressure, limit eating these above foods and focusing on low-sodium foods can help. Some good choices are: potassium-rich bananas, salt-free seasonings, potassium-packed white potatoes, fresh fish, nutrient-packed lima beans, iron-rich spinach, omega-3 fatty acids-rich flaxseed.

Did you know that we are exposed to 82,000 different toxins, chemically-based products and processed foods in our environment weekly?

Detoxification is the body’s natural, ongoing process of eliminating harmful toxins from the body so that it can function at its best. Toxins are man-made chemicals found in the air, water, food, household cleaners and cosmetic products as well as waste products produced by normal cellular activity.

When toxins enter the body through the skin, nasal passage or mouth, the body prevents “pollution” by surrounding the toxins with fat and water and stores them in different areas of the body. This can put a strain on our body’s own detox system (the liver, intestines, kidneys, lungs, skin, blood and lymphatic systems). These systems can become burdened as they try to safely excrete toxins.

Our bodies were not meant to work this hard to maintain optimal functioning. By adding a detox program to your wellness regimen, you can help pull these toxins, along with the excess fat and water, out of the body and improve your health quickly.

The Lymphatic System: Forgotten Hero

The lymphatic system is the most forgotten and least understood system in the body. It is critical to the detoxification process. The lymph travels parallel with the blood system and is responsible for the removal of wastes from every cell in the body, in addition to regulating the immune system. The lymph is thus a very important system to support optimal health.

Keep Your Body’s Drains Clean

The lymphatic system is like the garbage system of the body. Proper functioning of the lymphatic system is essential in order to properly eliminate wastes. Our lymphatic system can become and remain congested and stagnant for many years. Thus, we often live in an environment of toxins that weakens our immunity. Proper lymph drainage will eliminate these toxins and assist the body to function optimally.

Digestion: Where It All Begins

The body’s ability to detox starts in digestive system, in the villae of the small intestine. The “lacteals” in the villae are part of the lymphatic system and they pull nutrients and fat-soluble toxins off the intestinal wall. If the gut is constipated or there is excessive reactive mucus bogging down the villi, the lymph and its white blood cells may not provide immunity or detoxification.

The highest concentration of lymph is found lining the outside of the gut wall and is called the Gut Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT). The skin of the intestinal tract is constantly being exposed to toxins and undesirable microbes that could present a problem. So, the body has an immunity army waiting in the GALT just across the wall of the gut.

Dr. Vodder’s Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD)

Lymph vessels are also found under our skin throughout the body. These vessels support circulation, drainage of waste and immunity. When the lymph flow slows, the skin will appear dull and toxins will build up.

Since the lymph moves against gravity, it is common for the lymph and veins to congest, yielding an unsightly appearance in the feet, legs, thighs, hips, belly and arms.

Dr Vodder’s Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD) is a gentle rhythmical technique that gently works on the lymphatic vessels to enhance the flow of lymph throughout the body’s tissues.

MLD also helps to support the healthy function of the immune system and the autonomic nervous system, thereby reducing stress. The therapy cleanses the connective tissue of wastes, thus decongesting and reducing edema, pain and swelling.

Benefits of Manual Lymph Drainage Therapy

• Faster recovery and less scarring from surgery and other types of trauma by making lymph flow faster and stimulating the formation of new connections between lymph vessels

• Clears congestive conditions such as chronic sinusitis, bronchitis, acne, and headaches

• Strengthens the immune system

• Relieves heaviness tightness and swelling in those suffering from lymphedema.

• Increases overall relaxation by decreasing stress

• Relieves retention of fluids during pregnancy and menstrual cycle

• Decreases local edemas and hematomas from orthopedic surgery, cosmetic surgery scars, and burn scars; leading to a decreased in healing time and increase in client mobility

• People who suffer from insomnia, stress, fibromyalgia, and autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, lupus, and rheumatism benefit greatly from MLD

Earlier this summer a mom in Cincinnati made an astonishing discovery. Her son accidentally left his Walmart’s Great Value Ice Cream Sandwich outside while playing in 80° F (about 27°C).

After more than 12 hours she found the ice cream her son had left untouched and it wasn’t melted. The woman couldn’t believe what she was seeing and repeated the experiment. And to her astonishment the other ice cream didn’t melt either.

A video of the everlasting, unmeltable ice cream went viral on internet (click here to see the video). An embarrassed Walmart spokesman came up with the theory that the ice cream sandwich didn’t melt due to its high cream content. But is a high cream content the real ingredient that makes this ice cream unmeltable?

The answer is NO, according to a professor Sean O’Keefe. It is actually the other way around. More cream or fat makes ice cream melt faster! Non-fat or non-cream ice cream takes longer to melt due to its higher water content.

What Makes It Unmeltable?

Walmart’s great value ice cream sandwich contains corn syrup, guar gum, carob bean gum, cellulose gum, carrageenan, artificial flavors, MSG, and much more additives and preservatives that aren’t even considered food. The high amounts of all sorts of gums in this type of ice cream is probably the reason why it doesn’t melt.

Gums are complex carbs that were originally derived from plants to be used as thickeners or gel-forming agents. These days however most gums are synthetically made in the lab.

Gums and other chemically altered substance are not found in high quality or homemade ice creams, but this one bursts with it. Real ice cream, or the one you make at home, actually contains very few ingredients. Milk, cream, sugar, vanilla, chocolate or fresh fruits are basically it.

Artificial food ingredients have been linked to a wide range of health issues, including cancer, Alzheimer’s, allergies, and cardiovascular issues.

And did you know that to be called an ice cream, the product must only contain 10% milk and the rest can be anything else. So as always make sure to read your labels, avoid processed food and try and make your own and safe ice creams at home so that you absolutely know what’s in them.

This Walmart ice cream issue is actually not the only story out there. Have you ever seen the picture passing by from the eternal Mc Donald hamburger that lasts forever without getting moldy (it is spoilage free since 1996)? They found that the meat patty is loaded with salt (sodium) which is a preservative and the hamburger bun doesn’t even come close to real, natural bread.

So I can’t stress enough how important it is to read food labels and opt for whole, fresh, organic foods as much as possible.

With winter on our doorstep, many of us end up with a nasty cold or cough. While most people run to the store for over-the-counter meds packed with artificial dyes and chemicals, I prefer to go all-natural and avoid the harmful side effects of commercially available cough syrups.

You would be surprised of how many natural remedies are in your pantry right now. Pineapple juice is one of these wonderful healing ingredients to soothe a persistent cough or sore throat.

In 2010 Indian researchers tested the effectiveness of natural substances such as pineapple juice to treat tuberculosis (find the study here). They found that a mixture of pineapple juice with raw honey, pepper and salt work extremely well to dissolve mucus and soothe a persistent cough. Patients recovered up to 5 times quicker with this all natural pineapple remedy compared to OTC cough syrup.

Benefits Of Pineapple Juice

Pineapple thanks its many health benefits to a powerful enzyme called bromelain which acts as an antioxidant to reduce inflammation and swelling of the sinuses. It eliminates bacteria and fights infections.

Only 1 cup of pure pineapple juice contains 50% of your daily recommendation of vitamin C, another powerful antioxidant to strengthen your immune system and soothe a sore throat or cough.

Next to bromalain and vitamin C, pineapple is also a good source of vitamin A, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B-6, folate, pantothenic acid, magnesium, manganese and potassium, which are all essential nutrients to keep your body healthy.

Powerful All-natural Cough Suppressant Recipe

If you have a juicer it is best to make your own juice, or opt for unprocessed natural pineapple juice instead. Most commercially available brands contain too much sugar and added flavors and are low in the actual real fruit.

1 cup pineapple juice

¼ cup fresh lemon juice

1 piece of ginger (about 3 inches)

1 tablespoon raw honey

Pinch of salt

½ teaspoon cayenne pepper

Blend or juice all ingredients. Take ¼ cup of this remedy up to 3 times a day and your cough or sore throat will be gone in no time.

Note: to improve digestion and effectiveness add a pinch of turmeric as well.

What? That can’t be right, you are likely thinking.

It is.

The methanol in aspartame affects the dopamine system of the brain causing addiction. Methanol, or wood alcohol, is classified as a severe metabolic poison.

Aspartame is a dipeptide molecule produced by joining phenylalanine and aspartic acid. Aspartame itself does not occur naturally but is a manufactured substance. When aspartame is consumed, it is completely broken down by the enzymes in the digestive system into the two amino acids and a type of alcohol called methanol.

Methanol is a schedule II Narcotic.

What that means:

Schedule II substances have high abuse potential and severe psychological and/or physical dependence liability. Examples of schedule II substances include narcotics, amphetamines, and barbiturates. Prescriptions for schedule II substances can never be ordered with refills and must be filled within 7 days of the date originally written.

Yet you can buy diet soda and are encouraged to drink it because it has been marketed as a health product.

According to independent doctors and researchers, aspartame can cause a range of symptoms including but not limited to:

Headaches

Memory Loss

Vision Loss

Depression

Seizures

Coma

Cancer

Worse, it cam mimic symptoms of diseases like MS, Lupus, ADD, Diabetes, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.

It can be dangerous to take with medications, has reactive properties when combined with MSG (mono sodium glutamate) which is found in tons of packaged foods, and will induce cravings for carbohydrates which often leads to weight gain.

So much for the myths of diet and or healthy!

*Best Advice: Never touch a food with aspartame in it again.

*Alternate Advice: If you don’t feel ready to give up diet drinks or foods but are having any of these symptoms try a 60-day aspartame free test and see how much your health improves.

Our intake of polyunsaturated vegetable oils has tripled in the last 50 years, about the same time Americans started getting fatter and sicker. It turns out that vegetable oils like canola, safflower, soy, and sunflower are not the health foods we’ve been led to believe.

What’s Wrong with “Vegetable” Oils

These vegetable oils (which are really seed oils) are unstable and, when heated, turn into trans fats. Trans fats have been shown to cause brain atrophy as well as heart disease, cancer, obesity, and diabetes. Trans fats are also found in processed foods that say “hydrogenated” or “partially hydrogenated” on the label.

They are so detrimental to overall health that they have been banned in some areas and even some countries (Iceland, Sweden, Austria). Last year, they were banned in New York City and in November the FDA announced that they are considering banning trans fats in the form of hydrogenated oils.

They are a main source of unhealthy omega-6 fatty acids which contribute to chronic inflammation. If you have allergies or anything that ends in “itis” (i.e., arthritis, dermatitis, colitis), you have inflammation. Chronic inflammation is a contributor to seven of the top ten causes of death: heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and nephritis.

Currently we consume an average of 9% of our calories from these oils. Omega-6 toxicity begins at 4% intake. So most of us need to cut back their intake by at least 60% to be in the healthy range of 2-3%.

The Truth About Canola Oil

Many consumers believe canola oil is healthy because it is monounsaturated like olive oil, but few people realize exactly what they are consuming. There is no “canola plant”. Canola stands for “Canadian oil low acid” and comes from a genetically engineered form of rapeseed subsidized by the Canadian government. The name change was a PR move due to the bad connotation of the word rapeseed.

A major way canola differs from olive oil is that it’s not cold-pressed. It’s typically extracted with high heat, pressure, and chemical solvents which lead to the formation of trans fats. This ubiquitous oil is one you should definitely avoid.

Still not convinced? Here’s a quick look at how canola oil is manufactured. You’ll see the process is anything but “natural”.

Avoiding unhealthy vegetable oils is harder than it sounds. Look at the labels on processed or prepared foods, condiments, baked goods, and snack items. You’ll find these fats lurk in almost everything, even many foods from the health food store.

While avoiding unhealthy oils will be tough, I think you’ll like what I’m going to tell you next. There are three healthy fats you should stock in your kitchen – extra virgin olive oil, coconut oil, and, of all things, butter!

Olive Oil – Buyer Beware

Olive oil has been used medicinally for over 5,000 years. Its health benefits are legendary. Olive oil is a major component of the Mediterranean diet and is believed to be a factor why people in that part of the world are some of the healthiest and long-lived.

Olive oil has been found to boost the immune system, increase bone density, prevent cancer, strokes, and heart disease, lower blood pressure, and reduce your risk of diabetes. There’s evidence that olive oil can improve memory and increase overall cognitive function.

There is a caveat about using olive oil, however. Much of the store-bought extra virgin olive oil is fake! Cheap and unhealthy soy or canola oils are colored with industrial chlorophyll and flavored with artificial flavorings.

Fake olive oil is a huge business around the world – in the Europe, Australia, the US, and even China.

Olive oil is great to use “as is” but should not be heated. It burns at a very low temperature producing trans fats.

Coconut – the Healthy Oil with a Bad Reputation

Coconut oil is a very healthy fat that has an undeserved bad reputation. While it does contain saturated fat, that’s actually not a bad thing. This makes it extremely stable for cooking.

Coconut oil contains 50% lauric acid. This fatty acid is antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal. It lowers risk of heart disease by increasing good cholesterol and boosts the immune system. Lauric acid naturally occurs in human breast milk, but coconut is the only way to get it in your diet.

Coconut oil contains medium chain fats which can supply energy directly to the brain with no insulin spike. It’s this property that makes it a potential treatment for Alzheimer’s and other neurological disorders.

Butter is Better

Butter, like coconut oil, has gotten a bad rap but is actually a healthy fat. So trade in your faux butter spread for the real thing.

Butter contains all of the fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins D, E and K), and is a particularly good source of vitamin A. It’s rich in trace minerals and, if you buy grass-fed butter, is a good source of healthy omega-3 fatty acids.

But the real key to butter’s health benefits lies in its high butyrate content. Butyrate is a fatty acid that offers several health benefits. It’s very healing to the digestive tract. It reduces chronic inflammation. It counters neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.

Butter can actually help you lose weight by improving insulin sensitivity and stabilizing blood sugar levels. Eating butter with carbohydrates (on bread or potatoes, for example) lowers the glycemic index preventing blood sugar spikes and keeping you full longer.

When butter comes from cows that graze on grass, it contains high levels of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), a compound that protects against cancer, reduces inflammation, and makes it easier to burn fat and retain muscle mass.

It should be no surprise that the healthiest butter comes from the healthiest cows. Don’t expect ordinary grocery store butter to provide the same benefits as butter from grass-fed cows.

Your “New & Improved” Shopping List

Now that you know better, don’t be one of those people who gets 9% of calories from unhealthy vegetable oils! Here are four steps to take to transition from unhealthy to healthy oils.

Put extra virgin olive oil and organic coconut oil on your shopping list today! Do your homework and make sure your olive oil is the “real deal”. Then switch from whatever cooking oils you are using to these healthy oils.

Avoid any processed foods that say “hydrogenated” on the label.

Get rid of any fake fats like margarine and replace with butter. Be sure to get grass-fed butter to get the full health benefits.

Start reading labels on things like frozen potatoes, waffles, snacks, baked goods, prepared foods, and condiments. You’ll be dismayed by how many so-called “healthy” foods contain canola, soy, safflower, and sunflower oils. While you probably won’t be able to completely eliminate them from your diet, awareness if the first step towards minimizing them from your diet.

A YouTuber, My Pale Skin, decided to remove her makeup and posted pictures of herself on social media. She then created a powerful video documenting the reactions. This is unquestionably one to take a few moments to watch and then share.

Just goes to show that people are too judgemental and cruel. I personally rarely wear makeup anymore, but I understand the stigma that goes along with both flaws and going to great lengths to cover them up. Lately, my favorite phrase for all of this going on right now — from this to gay marriage and the Confederate flag — is “glass houses”, which some have misinterpreted as personal attacks. It is not. It only means that NONE of us are perfect. We ALL have flaws, and the sooner we stop judging one another, the better off the world will be.

The leading cause of cancer is the food we eat. A long time ago we consumed a diet of mainly alkaline food, but that has changed, and rate of cancer has increased. The majority doctors don’t inform you on the correct food to eat to stay free of cancer and what to eat to cause the body to remove it naturally.

The Foods we eat in today’s time contain both acid and alkalinizing forming elements. A diet of mainly acid-forming food can contribute to cancer. Unfortunately, that is a common diet here in the western culture. American’s diet today is mostly acidic. If you are fighting cancer, you need to balance the body’s pH level because cancer will thrive in an acidic environment whereas an alkaline environment will remove cancer.

We see more people with cancer today more than ever before, and it’s because the typical western diet is far too high in acid-producing foods such as animal products which include dairy products.

The foods we used to eat like freshly grown fruit and vegetables were much better for us, so the best solution is to make some dietary changes. The alkaline-acid ratio is measured on the pH scale which ranges from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral. The lower end of the scale which is from 0 to 7 is acidic, and anything between 7 to 14 is alkaline.

The easiest way to find out what foods are either alkaline or acidic is to research which foods are alkaline or acidic more so than others, also test your alkaline level often. While a diagnosis of cancer may have other contributing factors, the food we eat now is the main cause.

Many years ago before we had supermarkets we were eating a healthier diet, now because of processed foods and the popularity of fast food outlets our diets have changed. A diet of food from an acidic range is causing many health problems now, and cancer is just one of them. For instance, many of our foods are refined, and most of our bread and other baked foods are made from refined white flour.

Some other examples of acid forming foods are; pasta, cheese, ice cream and butter, jams and jellies, alcohol and soft drinks. All acid forming foods are not necessarily bad; it’s just our diet is out of balance, and if you are dealing with any serious health problem it’s essential to look carefully at what you are eating.

Some of the alkaline foods are fresh fruit and nearly all freshly grown vegetables. Also consuming, nuts, seeds, grains and legumes are all alkaline foods. It’s important to remember that the changes you make to a more alkaline diet have many health benefits including removing cancer naturally.

While cancer has some other contributing factors, the most important cause is what we eat, because our health is directly related to our dietary choices. Our diet has changed over the last 40 to 70 years, and most of what we eat now is available in supermarkets and supermarkets have an overwhelming influence on what we now buy.

Much of what’s available in supermarkets is processed, and because of it, this food is low in nutritional value, and that is without question the reason why there is so much cancer now. It makes a lot of sense if you are dealing with cancer that the first and the most important change you make is with your diet and that you select from a more alkaline range. Also, make sure it’s fresh and if all possible that it is organic.

The adhesives used on fruit and vegetable stickers are regulated by the FDA. They are labeled as “indirect food-contact substances.”

What chemicals the glue can be made from are listed in the Code of Federal Regulations part 175.125. The same rules apply to adhesives for both organic and conventional produce.

For any food-contact substance to be approved, the FDA considers its composition, the amount a consumer might eat, short and long-term health effects, and any other safety factors. The FDA then sets a threshold at a lower level than what one would be expect to have any adverse effect from. They still advise washing fruits and vegetables before eating them.

Why is that do you suppose?

Ever wondered what IS actually in that glue?

Fruits and vegetables have a skin, much like humans do. It is porous and absorbs things that are sprayed onto it or adhered to it.

Think of nicotine and birth control patches. You stick them to your arm and it absorbs systemically… These stickers may very well be doing the same thing to our produce…. So what exactly are they sticking to our food?

In turn, after a little research, it seems what they are really doing is sticking it to all of us.



Check this out: This is the list of approved adhesive/glue ingredients that can be used on produce here in the USA.

Trisodium – Corrosive when ingested.

Turpentine – Completely toxic when ingested.

Urea-formaldehyde resins – Rapid absorption, extremely toxic

Styrene Maleic anhydride – Non-surgical method of male sterilization

Petroleum – Highly toxic when ingested

Synthetic paraffin – Toxic when ingested

Xylene – In higher levels Xylene can cause progressive inhibition of nervous system function, culminating in coma, respiratory depression and ultimately death from cerebral anoxia. There is danger also of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia.

Zinc ammonium chloride – It is a Class 9 hazardous material according to the U.S. DOT. Used in galvanizing steel.

Zinc dibenzyl dithiocarbamate – This is a rubber accelerator which may cause skin and respiratory issues.

Zinc dibutyldithiocarbamate – This is a fire accelerant. Combustible and toxic.

Zinc diethyldithiocarbamate – toxic rubber accelerator and contact allergen.

Zinc formaldehyde sulfoxylate – Highly toxic. Do not handle without special equipment.

Zinc orthophosphate – Slightly toxic. May cause skin irritation.

Zinc resinate – The toxological properties of this substance have not been fully investigated. May cause skin and eye issues.

Zinc sulfide – Toxicity only develops after chronic exposure.

Zineb – fungicidal powder on vegetables and fruit. Can interfere with metabolism.

Ziram – Also used to control fungal infections on food. Ziram exposure has been linked to an increase in the chance of the development of Parkinson’s Disease.

*Some chemicals have been excluded from the list as they were either found to be labeled as safe or I was unable to find evidence either direction.

The FDA has set these at “approved levels” – But how can anything that toxic be safe at any level? And do you really trust the FDA? A little bit of poison cumulatively over time adds up. None of these items are things I personally care to ingest.

The best way to wash your fruits and vegetables:

Step 1. Soak in Vinegar and water for 10 minutes.

Step 2. Make your own non-toxic Goo-Gone.

It works on vegetables, fruits and other stuff!

Ingredients:

Coconut oil

Baking Soda

Mix 1 part baking soda and 1 part coconut oil, rub a little on the sticky spot, and let it sit for a minute or so. Then scrub the spot with a scouring pad or brush and rinse it off.

Will some of the toxins remain? I am unable to find any information conclusively one-way or the other. Please join me in writing to the FDA in protest. These chemicals are not safe, nor should they be anywhere near our food.

Influenza (flu) season is here. The media and CDC have been heavily pushing the influenza vaccine for over a month already. However, research has shown that this year’s flu shot is extremely toxic, ineffective and unsafe! Did you know that the 2013-2014 influenza vaccines contain dangerous levels of mercury? The vaccine contains 25,000 times more mercury than the safety limit for drinking water! Did you know that infant and pediatric flu deaths were on the decline until 2003 when the pediatric influenza vaccine was introduced? After that, the pediatric death rate skyrocketed! Before you choose to vaccinate yourself and your children, get the facts about the influenza vaccine.

I have recently written several articles on the problems and dangers of the flu shot. Read here about why the flu shot is more dangerous than the flu. You can also read here about how the media-reported flu deaths have been hyped up in order to scare people into the flu shot. Healthcare decisions, in general, can be complicated. The vaccine decision is even more complicated due to the vast amount of conflicting information. Before you make these decisions, I urge to move past the hype and get the facts!

Most importantly, you must know that your body is intelligently designed to fight the hundreds of influenza viruses that cause the flu. Your immune system is amazingly well equipped to help you prevent colds, flu and even cancer. Developing a flu-proof immune system is an essential part of your health plan this year. You can stay well! Even if you do get sick, you can overcome the flu and heal.

This astounding report was written by Mary Tocco, independent vaccine investigator. She reveals the truth about this years influenza vaccines and the facts that the pharmaceutical industry and the CDC do not want you to know. This is information provides facts not hype. It is exactly what you need in order to confidently make your decision about the influenza vaccine.

Influenza Vaccine Facts They Don’t Want You to Know!

Updated: September 5, 2013

Mary Tocco

The 2013-2014 Influenza vaccines have been approved for use and will contain Thimerosal (Hg, mercury) and are recommended for every child, adult and pregnant mother. Here are the 5 different influenza vaccines:

Trivalent Vaccines Afluria® 5.0 mL multi-dose vial—one 0.5mL jab will contain 24.5 μg Hg

FluLaval® 5.0 mL multi-dose vial—one 0.5 mL jab will contain less than 25μg Hg

Fluvirin® 0.5 mL one dose prefilled syringe will contain ≤ 1 μg Hg 5.0 mL multi-dose vial—one 0.5 mL jab will contain 25 μg Hg

Fluzone® 5.0 mL multi-dose vial—one 0.5 mL jab will contain 25 μg Hg

FluLaval® Quadrivalent 5.0 mL multi-dose vial—one jab will contain 25 μg Hg

Please keep in mind that one (1) microgram (μg) equals 0.0010 milligram (mg). Often physicians refer to the “trace” of thimerosal as safe and even healthy! The way to compare what a trace is in a vaccine is to compare to what is considered safe and allowable in our environment: water, liquids and foods we eat and compare the levels in the vaccines they encourage us to inject.

2 ppb (parts-per-billion) is the mandated safeyt limit in drinking water

200 ppb of mercury in liquid waste renders it a toxic hazard and must be treated as such

730-1400 ppb is EPA safe allowable limit in fish (we ingest)

 25,000 ppb may be found in the infant flu vaccine (injected)

50,000 ppb found in regular flu vaccine recommended for children, pregnant mothers and adults (injected)

Boyd Haley, Professor and Chair, Dept. of Chemistry, University Kentucky and mercury specialist in 2001 was responding to the statement that the mercury in vaccines is safe and he said the following, “A single vaccine given to a 6 pound newborn (containing thimerosal) is the equivalent of giving a 180-pound adult 30 vaccinations on the same day.”

Fact #1: Over 200 viruses can cause influenza and influenza-like illness which produce the same or similar symptoms. Unless you have laboratory tests, doctors cannot tell the illnesses apart. All these related illnesses can last for days and rarely lead to death or serious illness unless a person is immune compromised. Vaccines usually contain only three (3) viruses that were chosen to be included in vaccines many months before a flu season begins, so it is a guessing game as to which flu strain will actually occur.

Fact #2: Currently, there are no studies tracking people who get the vaccine and get sick with flu symptoms or other reactions including death, which should be made for proper disease diagnosis, data collecting and controls. When reported to doctors, people are told that they can’t catch the flu from the vaccine. I personally have had hundreds of people share their stories with me including stories about people who have died following the vaccine. Stories of paralysis, narcolepsy and febrile convulsions, neurological problems and pregnancy miscarriages are common. Nurses who work in the hospitals are witness to the numbers of people who come in to the emergency room very ill after the influenza vaccines.

Fact #3: Death rates from influenza are combined with people who are immune compromised and actually die with pneumonia, a complication of contracting influenza.

Fact #4: Prior to implementing the pediatric flu vaccine in 2003, pediatric deaths from influenza were decreasing. The CDC recommended universal influenza vaccines for children in 2003. According to the Center for Disease Vital Statistics and the MMWR Annual Report, deaths have increased, indicating flu vaccines are not as effective as advertised:

1999 – 25 deaths

2000 – 19 deaths

2001 – 13 deaths

2002 – 12 deaths

2003 – 90 deaths (Year of mass vaccinations of children under age 5 years)

2006 – 78 deaths

2007 – 88 deaths

2008 – 116 deaths (40.9% vaccinated at age 6 months to 23 months)

2009 – 276 deaths

2010 – 115 deaths

Neil Z. Miller, Vaccine Safety Manual For Concerned Families and Health Practitioners (New Atlantean Press) pg. 97 (Years 199-2003) References: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report – CDC Sept. 16, 2011 “Copyright Neil Z. Miller- Vaccine Safety Manual (New Atlantean Press)”

Fact #5: Influenza death rates are greatly exaggerated at the beginning of each flu season to drive people to get the vaccines. The common figure of 35,000 deaths per year is not true and has not been the true number for many years. A more accurate figure is closer to 20, 000 deaths per year nationally from influenza, and majority of time it is people who are immune compromised with other chronic/acute illnesses. The main reason for death is pneumonia, not the flu but the statistics are blended together to make it appear worse than it is. In the book, Vaccine Safety Manual (pg. 97) by Neil Z. Miller, he carefully examined the true statistics published in the Mortality Morbidity Weekly Report and found the actual deaths from pediatric influenza as noted above years 1999-2003.

Fact #6: National Coalition of Organized Women studied the numbers of pregnancy miscarriages following the H1N1 2009-2010 influenza vaccine program and found a 20-plus-fold increase in miscarriages compared to the previous flu-vaccine-associated-miscarriages in 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 flu season. The H1N1 influenza vaccine contains thimerosal, a form of ethylmercury that was supposed to be removed from all vaccines after Congressional Hearings. (Government Reform Committee Hearings on Autism and Vaccines 2000-2003) Thimerosal is in all multi-dose vaccine vials.

Fact #7: When children die of influenza, they never look to see if that child was fully vaccinated (normal childhood vaccinations) previously resulting in immune suppression or compromise or if they had just received the influenza vaccine. The media uses a few unfortunate deaths to scare people into getting the flu vaccines. They also reference “pandemic” when in fact the numbers are low and do not qualify as a true pandemic, whose definition was changed by the World Health Organization (WHO in 2009).

Reference: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2009/h1n1_pandemic_phase6_20090611/en/index.html

This was exactly what happened in the 2009-2010 world-wide influenza H1N1 season.

Fact #8: We were told the lie by the government that the H1N1 virus was a “never before seen virus” in 2009-2010 fake pandemic year. Pharmaceutical companies have been producing influenza vaccines for many years and have been giving people the H1N1 virus since 2006-2007 in 2 vaccines:

(1) Fluvirin® Purified Surface Antigen Vaccine, Trivalent, Types A and B Manufacturer Chiron Corp. Microorganism-Influenza virus H1N1, H3N2, B/Malaysia/2506/2004 strains Licensed 07/21/2006

(2) FluMist® Live, intranasal influenza Manufacturer MedImmune, Wyeth Microorganism- H1N1, H3N2, B/Jilin/20/2003 (B/Shanghai/361/2002-13; like strains of Influenza virus Licensed 01/05/2007

This new virus was bioengineered in a lab as are all the influenza vaccines. They are combining viruses that would never show up in nature. This is what I refer to as “FrankenScience” and is extremely dangerous. By introducing these to the world, they are assuring some crazy outbreak eventually as people’s immune systems malfunction.

Influenza: Evidence from Cochrane Reviews

The Cochrane Reviews have summarized data about the benefits and harms of several interventions for preventing and treating influenza. These comprehensive reviews provide valuable information for patients, doctors, and healthcare decision-makers. I encourage people to pull it off the Internet and read the entire review but here are some of the highlights of the report exposing the lack of safety and lack of effectiveness.

Viral epidemics or pandemics of acute respiratory infections like influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome pose a world-wide threat. Antiviral drugs and vaccinations may be insufficient to prevent catastrophe. This review assesses the effectiveness of physical interventions, such as hand-washing or wearing masks, to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.

Preventing influenza: drugs, including neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g. Relenza and Tamiflu) Amantadine and rimantadine for influenza A in children and the elderly. Although amantadine and rimantadine are used to relieve or treat influenza A symptoms in healthy adults, little is known about the effectiveness and safety of these antivirals in preventing and treating influenza A in children and the elderly.

Preventing influenza: vaccines for healthy people: The consequences of influenza in children and adults are mainly absenteeism from school and work.

We included 75 studies with about 300,000 observations. We included 17 RCTs, 19 cohort studies and 11 case-control studies in the analysis of vaccine efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence from RCTs shows that six children under the age of six need to be vaccinated with live attenuated vaccine to prevent one case of influenza (infection and symptoms). We could find no usable data for those aged two years or younger.

Inactivated vaccines in children aged two years or younger are not significantly more efficacious than placebo. Twenty-eight children over the age of six need to be vaccinated to prevent one case of influenza (infection and symptoms). Eight need to be vaccinated to prevent one case of influenza-like-illness (ILI). We could find no evidence of effect on secondary cases, lower respiratory tract disease, drug prescriptions, otitis media and its consequences and socioeconomic impact.

We found weak single-study evidence of effect on school absenteeism by children and caring parents from work. Extensive evidence of reporting bias of safety outcomes from trials of live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) impeded meaningful analysis. One specific brand of monovalent pandemic vaccine is associated with cataplexy and narcolepsy in children and there is sparse evidence of serious harms (such as febrile convulsions) in specific situations.

Conclusions: Influenza vaccines are efficacious in preventing cases of influenza in children older than two years of age, but little evidence is available for children younger than two years of age. There was a difference between vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, partly due to differing datasets, settings and viral circulation patterns. No safety comparisons could be carried out, emphasizing the need for standardization of methods and presentation of vaccine safety data in future studies. In specific cases, influenza vaccines were associated with serious harms such as narcolepsy and febrile convulsions. It was surprising to find only one study of inactivated vaccine in children under two years, given current recommendations to vaccinate healthy children from six months of age in the USA, Canada, parts of Europe and Australia. If immunization in children is to be recommended as a public health policy, large-scale studies assessing important outcomes, and directly comparing vaccine types are urgently required.

Influenza Manufacturer’s Package Inserts Admit the Following:

“There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response”.

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Fluzone or Fluzone High-Dose. It is also not known whether Fluzone or Fluzone High-Dose can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction (fertility) capacity.

“It is not known whether Fluzone or Fluzone Intradermal is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Fluzone or Fluzone Intradermal is administered to a nursing woman.

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with FluMist.

It is not known whether FluMist can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity.

Flu Vaccine Ingredients may contain all or some of the following toxic vaccine additives (adjuvants) [CDC – Vaccine Excipient & Media Summary]:

Egg protein – many are allergic to eggs

Formaldehyde – Formalyn (formalin) is a 37 percent solution of gaseous formaldehyde which includes methanol. (Used in vaccines as a tissue fixative) Formaldehyde solution (formalin) is considered a hazardous compound and it is vapor toxic. Formaldehyde is a U.S. EPA declared carcinogen.

Polysorbate 80 – shown to cause infertility in mice

Sodium Chloride and Calcium Chloride

Monosodium Glutamate (MSG):C5H8NNaO4, a Stabilizer MSG -MSG intolerance: There have been numerous studies of allergies and/or sensitivities to MSG, attributed to the free glutamic acid component, an excitotoxin, which has been blamed for causing a wide variety of physical symptoms such as migraines, nausea, digestive upsets, drowsiness, heart palpitation, hair loss, asthma, anaphylactic shock, rapidly increasing diabetes, and many other complaints.

Potassium phosphate – a soluble salt which is used as a fertilizer, a food additive and a fungicide. It is a source of phosphorus and potassium. It is also a buffering agent.

Thimerosal – a form of ethyl mercury still found in some multi-vile vaccines. Ethylmercury is more toxic than methylmercury because it crosses the blood-brain barrier quicker and converts to inorganic mercury. This inorganic mercury is most difficult to excrete and stays in the brain longer and in higher levels. (Institute of Medicine 2005)

Polyoxidonium – Synthetic polymers and nano-materials display selective phenotypic effects in cells and in the body that affect signal transduction mechanisms involved in inflammation, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (cell death). When physically mixed or covalently conjugated with cytotoxic agents, bacterial DNA or antigens, polymers can drastically alter specific genetically controlled responses to these agents.

Squalene – An oil based adjuvant that has never been approved in the US as safe, can cause blindness, autoimmune dysfunction and can inhibit sperm production. More than two dozen peer-reviewed scientific papers from ten different laboratories throughout the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia have been published documenting the development of autoimmune disease in animals subjected to it.

“The vaccine decision is a very complicated decision to make when you consider the conflicting information given out by doctors, the media and our Center for Disease Control. I encourage people to learn all they can about the role of natural immunity through natural exposure to infectious illnesses, plus proper nutrition and supplementation to enhance the immune system. Credit is being given to vaccines for improving the health of people across the globe and this researcher feels that there are many other influences that need to be considered. Being a parent carries a huge responsibility to educate ourselves and protect our children, and that means keeping them safe from neurotoxins and toxic chemicals via pollution and vaccines.”

Influenza (flu) season is here. The media and CDC have been heavily pushing the influenza vaccine for over a month already. However, research has shown that this year’s flu shot is extremely toxic, ineffective and unsafe! Did you know that the 2013-2014 influenza vaccines contain dangerous levels of mercury? The vaccine contains 25,000 times more mercury than the safety limit for drinking water! Did you know that infant and pediatric flu deaths were on the decline until 2003 when the pediatric influenza vaccine was introduced? After that, the pediatric death rate skyrocketed! Before you choose to vaccinate yourself and your children, get the facts about the influenza vaccine.

I have recently written several articles on the problems and dangers of the flu shot. Read here about why the flu shot is more dangerous than the flu. You can also read here about how the media-reported flu deaths have been hyped up in order to scare people into the flu shot. Healthcare decisions, in general, can be complicated. The vaccine decision is even more complicated due to the vast amount of conflicting information. Before you make these decisions, I urge to move past the hype and get the facts!

Most importantly, you must know that your body is intelligently designed to fight the hundreds of influenza viruses that cause the flu. Your immune system is amazingly well equipped to help you prevent colds, flu and even cancer. Developing a flu-proof immune system is an essential part of your health plan this year. You can stay well! Even if you do get sick, you can overcome the flu and heal.

This astounding report was written by Mary Tocco, independent vaccine investigator. She reveals the truth about this years influenza vaccines and the facts that the pharmaceutical industry and the CDC do not want you to know. This is information provides facts not hype. It is exactly what you need in order to confidently make your decision about the influenza vaccine.

Influenza Vaccine Facts They Don’t Want You to Know!

Updated: September 5, 2013

Mary Tocco

The 2013-2014 Influenza vaccines have been approved for use and will contain Thimerosal (Hg, mercury) and are recommended for every child, adult and pregnant mother. Here are the 5 different influenza vaccines:

Trivalent Vaccines Afluria® 5.0 mL multi-dose vial—one 0.5mL jab will contain 24.5 μg Hg

FluLaval® 5.0 mL multi-dose vial—one 0.5 mL jab will contain less than 25μg Hg

Fluvirin® 0.5 mL one dose prefilled syringe will contain ≤ 1 μg Hg 5.0 mL multi-dose vial—one 0.5 mL jab will contain 25 μg Hg

Fluzone® 5.0 mL multi-dose vial—one 0.5 mL jab will contain 25 μg Hg

FluLaval® Quadrivalent 5.0 mL multi-dose vial—one jab will contain 25 μg Hg

Please keep in mind that one (1) microgram (μg) equals 0.0010 milligram (mg). Often physicians refer to the “trace” of thimerosal as safe and even healthy! The way to compare what a trace is in a vaccine is to compare to what is considered safe and allowable in our environment: water, liquids and foods we eat and compare the levels in the vaccines they encourage us to inject.

2 ppb (parts-per-billion) is the mandated safeyt limit in drinking water

200 ppb of mercury in liquid waste renders it a toxic hazard and must be treated as such

730-1400 ppb is EPA safe allowable limit in fish (we ingest)

 25,000 ppb may be found in the infant flu vaccine (injected)

50,000 ppb found in regular flu vaccine recommended for children, pregnant mothers and adults (injected)

Boyd Haley, Professor and Chair, Dept. of Chemistry, University Kentucky and mercury specialist in 2001 was responding to the statement that the mercury in vaccines is safe and he said the following, “A single vaccine given to a 6 pound newborn (containing thimerosal) is the equivalent of giving a 180-pound adult 30 vaccinations on the same day.”

Fact #1: Over 200 viruses can cause influenza and influenza-like illness which produce the same or similar symptoms. Unless you have laboratory tests, doctors cannot tell the illnesses apart. All these related illnesses can last for days and rarely lead to death or serious illness unless a person is immune compromised. Vaccines usually contain only three (3) viruses that were chosen to be included in vaccines many months before a flu season begins, so it is a guessing game as to which flu strain will actually occur.

Fact #2: Currently, there are no studies tracking people who get the vaccine and get sick with flu symptoms or other reactions including death, which should be made for proper disease diagnosis, data collecting and controls. When reported to doctors, people are told that they can’t catch the flu from the vaccine. I personally have had hundreds of people share their stories with me including stories about people who have died following the vaccine. Stories of paralysis, narcolepsy and febrile convulsions, neurological problems and pregnancy miscarriages are common. Nurses who work in the hospitals are witness to the numbers of people who come in to the emergency room very ill after the influenza vaccines.

Fact #3: Death rates from influenza are combined with people who are immune compromised and actually die with pneumonia, a complication of contracting influenza.

Fact #4: Prior to implementing the pediatric flu vaccine in 2003, pediatric deaths from influenza were decreasing. The CDC recommended universal influenza vaccines for children in 2003. According to the Center for Disease Vital Statistics and the MMWR Annual Report, deaths have increased, indicating flu vaccines are not as effective as advertised:

1999 – 25 deaths

2000 – 19 deaths

2001 – 13 deaths

2002 – 12 deaths

2003 – 90 deaths (Year of mass vaccinations of children under age 5 years)

2006 – 78 deaths

2007 – 88 deaths

2008 – 116 deaths (40.9% vaccinated at age 6 months to 23 months)

2009 – 276 deaths

2010 – 115 deaths

Neil Z. Miller, Vaccine Safety Manual For Concerned Families and Health Practitioners (New Atlantean Press) pg. 97 (Years 199-2003) References: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report – CDC Sept. 16, 2011 “Copyright Neil Z. Miller- Vaccine Safety Manual (New Atlantean Press)”

Fact #5: Influenza death rates are greatly exaggerated at the beginning of each flu season to drive people to get the vaccines. The common figure of 35,000 deaths per year is not true and has not been the true number for many years. A more accurate figure is closer to 20, 000 deaths per year nationally from influenza, and majority of time it is people who are immune compromised with other chronic/acute illnesses. The main reason for death is pneumonia, not the flu but the statistics are blended together to make it appear worse than it is. In the book, Vaccine Safety Manual (pg. 97) by Neil Z. Miller, he carefully examined the true statistics published in the Mortality Morbidity Weekly Report and found the actual deaths from pediatric influenza as noted above years 1999-2003.

Fact #6: National Coalition of Organized Women studied the numbers of pregnancy miscarriages following the H1N1 2009-2010 influenza vaccine program and found a 20-plus-fold increase in miscarriages compared to the previous flu-vaccine-associated-miscarriages in 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 flu season. The H1N1 influenza vaccine contains thimerosal, a form of ethylmercury that was supposed to be removed from all vaccines after Congressional Hearings. (Government Reform Committee Hearings on Autism and Vaccines 2000-2003) Thimerosal is in all multi-dose vaccine vials.

Fact #7: When children die of influenza, they never look to see if that child was fully vaccinated (normal childhood vaccinations) previously resulting in immune suppression or compromise or if they had just received the influenza vaccine. The media uses a few unfortunate deaths to scare people into getting the flu vaccines. They also reference “pandemic” when in fact the numbers are low and do not qualify as a true pandemic, whose definition was changed by the World Health Organization (WHO in 2009).

Reference: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2009/h1n1_pandemic_phase6_20090611/en/index.html

This was exactly what happened in the 2009-2010 world-wide influenza H1N1 season.

Fact #8: We were told the lie by the government that the H1N1 virus was a “never before seen virus” in 2009-2010 fake pandemic year. Pharmaceutical companies have been producing influenza vaccines for many years and have been giving people the H1N1 virus since 2006-2007 in 2 vaccines:

(1) Fluvirin® Purified Surface Antigen Vaccine, Trivalent, Types A and B Manufacturer Chiron Corp. Microorganism-Influenza virus H1N1, H3N2, B/Malaysia/2506/2004 strains Licensed 07/21/2006

(2) FluMist® Live, intranasal influenza Manufacturer MedImmune, Wyeth Microorganism- H1N1, H3N2, B/Jilin/20/2003 (B/Shanghai/361/2002-13; like strains of Influenza virus Licensed 01/05/2007

This new virus was bioengineered in a lab as are all the influenza vaccines. They are combining viruses that would never show up in nature. This is what I refer to as “FrankenScience” and is extremely dangerous. By introducing these to the world, they are assuring some crazy outbreak eventually as people’s immune systems malfunction.

Influenza: Evidence from Cochrane Reviews

The Cochrane Reviews have summarized data about the benefits and harms of several interventions for preventing and treating influenza. These comprehensive reviews provide valuable information for patients, doctors, and healthcare decision-makers. I encourage people to pull it off the Internet and read the entire review but here are some of the highlights of the report exposing the lack of safety and lack of effectiveness.

Viral epidemics or pandemics of acute respiratory infections like influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome pose a world-wide threat. Antiviral drugs and vaccinations may be insufficient to prevent catastrophe. This review assesses the effectiveness of physical interventions, such as hand-washing or wearing masks, to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.

Preventing influenza: drugs, including neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g. Relenza and Tamiflu) Amantadine and rimantadine for influenza A in children and the elderly. Although amantadine and rimantadine are used to relieve or treat influenza A symptoms in healthy adults, little is known about the effectiveness and safety of these antivirals in preventing and treating influenza A in children and the elderly.

Preventing influenza: vaccines for healthy people: The consequences of influenza in children and adults are mainly absenteeism from school and work.

We included 75 studies with about 300,000 observations. We included 17 RCTs, 19 cohort studies and 11 case-control studies in the analysis of vaccine efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence from RCTs shows that six children under the age of six need to be vaccinated with live attenuated vaccine to prevent one case of influenza (infection and symptoms). We could find no usable data for those aged two years or younger.

Inactivated vaccines in children aged two years or younger are not significantly more efficacious than placebo. Twenty-eight children over the age of six need to be vaccinated to prevent one case of influenza (infection and symptoms). Eight need to be vaccinated to prevent one case of influenza-like-illness (ILI). We could find no evidence of effect on secondary cases, lower respiratory tract disease, drug prescriptions, otitis media and its consequences and socioeconomic impact.

We found weak single-study evidence of effect on school absenteeism by children and caring parents from work. Extensive evidence of reporting bias of safety outcomes from trials of live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) impeded meaningful analysis. One specific brand of monovalent pandemic vaccine is associated with cataplexy and narcolepsy in children and there is sparse evidence of serious harms (such as febrile convulsions) in specific situations.

Conclusions: Influenza vaccines are efficacious in preventing cases of influenza in children older than two years of age, but little evidence is available for children younger than two years of age. There was a difference between vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, partly due to differing datasets, settings and viral circulation patterns. No safety comparisons could be carried out, emphasizing the need for standardization of methods and presentation of vaccine safety data in future studies. In specific cases, influenza vaccines were associated with serious harms such as narcolepsy and febrile convulsions. It was surprising to find only one study of inactivated vaccine in children under two years, given current recommendations to vaccinate healthy children from six months of age in the USA, Canada, parts of Europe and Australia.

Janette Murray-Wakelin is a breast cancer survivor who credits a raw food diet, meditation, physical activity, and following her intuition for her ability heal. In the early 2000s, she was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer and told that she had just six months to live, without any guarantees. However, within those same six months, she was given a clean bill of health and also went on to participate in hundreds of marathons in only one year.(1,2) That’s right, in just one year.

She explains that she was offered chemotherapy, but that it “didn’t make sense” to her.(1)

“I was already compromised, so why would I compromise myself further so I’d get another six months of being sick?”(1) Rather than embrace what she calls a “very fear-driven” mindset that many doctors create in such a situation, she shunned their chemo and radiation recommendations in favor of alternative methods that she felt were significantly wiser and healthier choices. “Most people go with what their doctor says because they don’t realize that they can take responsibility and control themselves,” Murray-Wakelin says.(1)

The Decision to Walk Away from Traditional Cancer Treatments

So, without hesitation, she walked away from traditional cancer treatments and started asking herself what she could put in her body to make a difference. What made the most sense to her was to enjoy a diet filled with high-nutrient, living foods.(1)

Australia resident Murray-Wakelin, who was a vegetarian at the time of her diagnosis — something she says worked in her favor, making her better poised to fight her breast cancer and respond to juicing — had always been interested in fitness and health. However, she believes that accidental exposure to high-chemical substances that got on her skin and being in an area where she was exposed to toxic levels of pollution led to her diagnosis.(1)

Upon receiving news of her breast cancer, she immediately immersed herself in research and read up on others who chose to forego traditional cancer treatments. Referring to many books and studies that have a slew of side effects and questionable results listed, she notes that “…the smaller the print got, the more it became obvious that this was not the thing to do.”(1) Instead, she turned to the book The Breuss Cancer Cure by Rudolph Breuss, doing a 42-day juice fast based on its writings.(1)

Healing Foods for Breast Cancer Recovery

For her particular situation, the fast included several healthy foods from the Brassicaceae family such as beet root, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts.(1) After 42 days, she added other foods such as carrots and green apple to her juices.

Wheat grass was also a must, helping to rid harmful cells. “Cancer cannot survive in an oxygenated environment, therefore the more oxygen I could pump into the body through exercise, conscious breathing and drinking wheat grass, the better,” she says.(2) She says that the idea was to starve her cancer while at the same time, provide the body with nothing but essential nutrients to keep it going strong.(1)

Why Staying Physically Active Keeps Cancer at Bay

As for fitness, she explains that doctors told her to take it easy and to stop running. “So, the first thing I did,” she says with a laugh, “was increase my distance.”(1) Once again, she stresses the importance of how cancer cells can not thrive in an oxygenated environment, which is why she felt exercising more and not less, was essential.

Just how active has she been?

In 2013, her and her husband ran 365 marathons for 365 consecutive days throughout the year. On January 1, 2014, they ran one more which set a new world record for the most consecutive marathons.(3) By the way, they’re both in their sixties! They say their 100% raw vegan plant-based diet, awareness of sustainability, and faith in human kindness and healing naturally keeps them motivated.(3) Barefoot shoes, they add, help too.

She describes having tons of energy and feeling “fantastic.”(2)

“There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that consuming 100% raw food made a huge difference to my recovery time and to my overall healing,” she says.(2) “My diagnosis of cancer and resulting journey to optimum health has been an experience I am truly grateful for. I know for certain that I will continue on the raw path, as I continue to experience more health benefits and an ever-increasing enlightened consciousness. Every day is exciting when you are raw!”

Americans are slowly waking up to the sad fact that their food supply is packed with hazardous and toxic compounds. Many of the American foods you may be eating on a daily basis are banned in other countries because they contain compounds that are known to cause inflammation, growth defects and cancer.

For some reason the US government and FDA allows these toxic foods to end up in our supermarkets while other countries have taken them off the shelves.

Here’s a list of 10 banned foods every American should stop eating today:

1. Pink Slime

Pink slime is a name used for processed low-grade beef trimmings and meat by-products. They use ammonium hydroxide in their processing, which is banned in many other countries outside the US. This pink slime is often added to processed foods. Products can contain up to 15% without additional labeling.

Banned in: Canada, UK, and EU.

2. Farm-Raised Salmon

Farm raised salmons are fed with an unnatural diet of GMO grains and dangerous chemicals such as synthetic astaxanthin (derived from petrochemical) and antibiotics. It causes their flesh to become grey-ish instead of the pink-red of wild salmon. Avoid all Atlantic salmon as these are mostly coming from fish farms. Look for the “Alaskan salmon” and “sockeye salmon, both not allowed to be farmed.

Banned in: Australia and New Zealand

3. Hormone-infused Beef and Dairy

Many of the American cows are fed synthetic hormones to increase meat or milk production. These hormones (rBGH and rBST) end up in the meat and dairy products we consume. Non-organic meat or dairy has been linked to breast, colon, and prostate cancers.

Banned in: Australia, New Zealand, Israel, EU, and Canada.

4. Genetically Modified Papaya

Many of the papayas Americans eat are genetically engineered to be resistant to the ringspot virus. Studies show that animals fed GMO food, such as corn and soy, have an increased risk of organ damage, tumors, birth defects, premature death, and sterility.

Banned in: EU

5. Bread With Potassium Bromate

Commercial baking companies enrich their flour with potassium bromate to reduce the baking time and make the dough more elastic. Too much potassium bromate can cause kidney and nerve damage, thyroid issues, digestive disorders, and cancer.

Banned in: Canada, China and the EU

6. Ractopamine-Tained Meat

Ractopamine is a growth stimulator widely used in the US to increase the weight of pigs, cattle, and turkey. It has been linked to cardiovascular issues, birth defects, and hyperactivity.

Banned in: 160 countries across Europe, Russia, China, and Taiwan

7. Arsenic-Laced Chicken

Arsenic-based drugs are used to make the chickens grow faster and it makes their meat pinker which gives it a fresher look. Inorganic arsenic is a known carcinogen.

Banned in: EU

8. Drinks With Brominated Vegetable Oil (BVO)

Mountain dew and a few other citrus-flavored sports drinks are emulsified with brominated vegetable oil (BVO). Its main compound is bromine, which is used as a flame retardant. Too much bromine can lead to iodine deficiency, skin rashes, acne, fatigue, and cardiovascular problems.

Banned: EU and Japan

9. Preservative BHA And BHT

Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) are often used as a preservative in cereals, nut mixes, meat, beer, butter, and gum. It has been linked to certain allergies and may cause cancer.

Banned in: infant food in the UK, parts of the EU, and Japan.

10. Bleached Flour

Azodicarbonamide is often used by US food companies to bleach flour quicker. This chemical, also found in shoe soles, has been linked to asthma and some types of cancer.

Banned in: Singapore.

11. Processed Foods With Artificial Food Colors

Some of the food flavorings, additives, colors, and preservatives used in the US are banned in other counties because they are made from coal tar and petroleum. These include red 40 and yellow 5 which can cause hyperactivity, brain and nerve damage, birth defects, allergies, and cancer.

Banned: Norway in, Austria and most of the EU.

12. Olestra/Olean

Olestra, aka Olean, is a substitute for fat in fat free products. It depletes essential vitamins and can cause anal leakages.

Banned in: UK, Canada and many other countries around the world.

Always make sure to read food labels and eliminate all processed food out of your diet to avoid all these harmful chemicals. Opt for a healthy fresh, whole food diet instead.

Americans are slowly waking up to the sad fact that their food supply is packed with hazardous and toxic compounds. Many of the American foods you may be eating on a daily basis are banned in other countries because they contain compounds that are known to cause inflammation, growth defects and cancer.

For some reason the US government and FDA allows these toxic foods to end up in our supermarkets while other countries have taken them off the shelves.

Here’s a list of 10 banned foods every American should stop eating today:

Depression and mood disorders are devastating health problems today. When you go to your doctor, their answer is often a prescription for one of the various popular anti-depressant drugs. Many doctors do not investigate for metabolic or nutritional deficiencies that may be the ‘real problem’ for your depression. Patients have no idea why they feel so awful or where to start looking for the answer. They expect their doctor to give them real solutions. Instead they get drugs as the easy fix. Drugs are not an easy fix because of the serious side effects that come with taking them. Doctors prescribe these drugs from information they get from the drug sales rep which often is only part-truth. The side effects and dangers of these drugs are down-played or left out altogether. Prescription drugs should only be prescribed after other medical problems have been ruled out.

Learn About 10 Nutrient Deficiencies That Cause Depression and Mood Disorder Symptoms:



If you suffer from depression or mood disorders you may be deficient in one of the nutrients below. Researchers have found that many people who suffer from depression and mood disorders are deficient in not just one nutrient but several, all contributing to the symptoms.

#1: Healthy Food Deficiency? Junk Food Diet Is your diet filled with sugar, junk foods, sodas, or processed foods? Do you often skip meals. If you suffer from depression or mood disorders, start a food diary of the foods you eat every day. You will find answers to your health problems while doing that. Your shopping cart and refrigerator tell the story of your health. My husband works as a cashier at Walmart. People shopping for their family fill their cart with junk sugar filled cereal, chips, candy, soda, , TV dinners, and over-processed food in general. Seven-Elevens thrive on selling candy, soda, and chips to the eat-on-the-run customers. There are very few fresh vegetables or fruit on the average American’s grocery list. This is why so many Americans are obese, depressed, and suffering from diabetes. If your life is not going well, eating junk food is not going to improve your outlook.

#2: Omega-3 Fatty Acids Deficiency: These are found in foods such as fish and Flax Seed Oil. A deficiency of Omega-3 fatty acids or an imbalance between Omega 3 and Omega 6 fatty acids may be one of the contributing factors to your depression. Omega 3 Fatty acids are important to brain function and your mental outlook on life. They also help people who suffer from inflammation and pain problems. Researchers have found that many patients with depression and mood disorders are deficient in Omega 3 Fatty Acids. It is important to buy fish oil that has been cold processed and tested for heavy metals and other contamination. It should state that on the label.

#3: Vitamin D Deficiency: Important to immune function, bones, and brain health. Sunlight is the richest source for natural Vitamin D. The Journal Clinical Nutrition in Jan 21st, 2013 published the result of research that analyzed over 18000 British citizens for Vitamin D deficiencies and associated mental disorders links. They found that a deficiency of Vitamin D was present in patients with depression and panic disorders. The study results stated that people who are deficient in Vitamin D are at higher risk for developing depression later in life. Most seniors are deficient in Vitamin D. Often people working long hours in offices are deficient as well. Get out in the sun. Take a walk during your lunch break or walk your dog. Play a game with your kids outside away from computers and the television. Get out of the house and into the sunshine. Just don’t overdo it if you are sensitive to the sun. Overdoing it is not good either.

#4: B-Vitamins Deficiency: There is much research in Neuropsychiatry that proves the link between B-Vitamin deficiencies and mood disorders including depression. Buy gel capsules instead of tablets with at least 25 mg for each of the different B- Vitamins included in the formulation.

#5: Zinc , Folate, Chromium, and Iron Deficiencies: Patients with depression are often found deficient in many nutrients including these. Often today’s foods are sadly lacking in minerals and trace minerals.

#6: Iodine Deficiency: Iodine is necessary for the thyroid to work properly. The thyroid, part of the endocrine system, is one of the most important glands in your body. The thyroid gland affects every function of the body including body temperature, immune function, and brain function. Iodine is found in foods such as potatoes, cranberries, Kelp, Arame, Hiziki, Kombu, and Wakame. This problem was once solved by using Iodine enriched salt. Today iodine deficiency is again becoming a problem with salt free diets. Salty chips, processed foods, and junk food do not contain iodized salt.

#7: Amino Acids Deficiency: There are 9 necessary amino acids that cannot be manufactured in your body. You must supply them to the body by eating quality food choices.



Amino acids are found in meat, eggs, fish, high quality beans, seeds and nuts. You need to eat a variety of different foods to furnish the body with all the amino acids needed to be healthy. Not all foods contain all nine amino acids. Vegetable food sources for amino acids include Moringa Oleifera leaves. Your brain uses the amino acids found in the food you eat to manufacture neurotransmitters needed for optimal brain function.

What are neurotransmitters and what do they have to do with depression? Healthy brain function needs the proper balance of neurotransmitters. Some neurotransmitters calm the brain and others excite the brain. Their balance in the brain creates stability of emotions and thinking. Often depression and other mental disorders are caused by imbalances in neurotransmitters. Dopamine, noradrenaline, and GABA are three important neurotransmitters often deficient in depression. Orthomolecular physicians have found that treatment with amino acids including tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and methionine can correct different mood disorders like depression. The Orthomolecular doctor first takes urine and blood samples to test your amino acid levels. Then if he finds imbalances, you will be given amino acid supplements in the optimal dosage to correct the problem. Orthomolecular doctors treat the base cause for the depression or mental symptoms. If it is a nutritional imbalance such as a Omega 3 deficiency, you will be prescribed that supplement. Instead of treating with drugs, they treat the deficiencies that cause the mental symptoms with vitamins, minerals, and amino acids.

There are tests that prove nutrient deficiencies. The problem is often your standard medicine doctor will not give clearance for the tests, nor will your insurance pay for them. Most doctors are not schooled in nutrition and diet. They have no time to go over your eating and lifestyle habits. Saying that, a few companies and health providers exist who do have preventive health programs. The reality is a majority of people do not get quality preventive healthcare, especially those on Medicaid or Medical. You need to visit a holistic doctor who knows his nutrition. More than likely you will have to pay out-of-pocket for the tests. You can go through Life Extension Institute. After becoming a member, you can receive the tests through the mail. You take the kit to a lab to get your blood drawn. You then send the kit back by mail and receive the results by mail. They do not give you interpretation for the tests nor how to correct the problems found by testing. You can at least find out what vitamins and minerals you are deficient in. Drug-focused therapy is the main reason that so many people never get diagnosed properly. Insurance plans will pay for drugs but not nutritional supplements. That is the sad state of our health care system here. You must take control of your health and find a doctor whose goal is holistic and preventative medicine.

There has been only one brief rain delay so far at Wimbledon, though thunderstorms are possible on Thursday with temperatures already around 28 degrees C (82 degrees F).

Federer, a seven-time champion at the All England Club, will play on Centre Court against Dusan Lajovic in the second round. The top-ranked Kerber will face Kirsten Flipkens on No. 1 Court.

Novak Djokovic and Juan Martin del Potro are also on the schedule. If both players win on Thursday, they will meet in the third round.

It's the most anticipated gathering of world leaders — and potentially the most explosive — for years. The G-20 kicks off in Hamburg in a few hours and will feature, among others, an unpredictable U.S. president with a protectionist bent, a Russian leader subject to international sanctions and a Chinese president looking to assert a greater global role. The so-called "special relationship" between the U.K. and the U.S. will be under the microscope, and all eyes will be on Xi Jinping and Angela Merkel after the pair bonded over pandas and Xi announced a "new beginning" for the two countries' relations. And everything will be played out against a backdrop of North Korean aggression, which has caused friction between the world's two biggest economies. Popcorn time?

Malaysia's Mahathir still hates currency traders. Twenty years ago, as the Asian financial crisis raged, then Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad blasted currency traders as "unscrupulous profiteers". Now, at age 91, he hasn't lost any of that disdain for the speculators who drove the Malaysian economy to the brink, saying he doesn't believe currency trading should even be a business.

Singapore's Lee family to manage their feud behind closed doors. The younger siblings of Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong have welcomed an offer by their brother to take the dispute over their late father's estate out of the spotlight. The siblings said they would stop posting documents relating to the feud on social media, as long as their father’s wish to demolish his residential home was not attacked. And how did they let the world know? With a seven-page statement on Facebook.

Deutsche Bank retreats from London and heads for home. The bank is preparing to move large parts of the trading and investment-banking assets it currently books in London to its hometown of Frankfurt in response to Britain’s exit from the European Union, people familiar with the matter said. The strategy, which is still being finalized and would be reviewed if the Brexit scenario changes, will probably be implemented over the next 18 months.

North Korea's launch puts pressure on U.S. missile defense. Kim Jong Un’s test of an ICBM capable of striking the U.S. mainland is putting renewed pressure on a U.S. missile defense system racing to keep up with North Korea’s quickly evolving military threat. While the U.S. “completely obliterated” a mock ICBM in a test in May, analysts call those tests choreographed events that don’t reflect real-world scenarios. Even missile defense advocates have their concerns.

Canon jumped gun on merger, others may have given wrong data

General Electric Co., Merck KGaA, Sigma-Aldrich Corp. and Canon Inc. risk fines for breaching European Union merger rules after regulators sent them antitrust complaints, months after the EU fined Facebook $125 million for giving misleading information during a deal review.

GE was accused of misleading officials examining its 1.5 billion-euro takeover of LM Wind Power, the European Commission said Thursday. Darmstadt, Germany-based Merck KGaA and Sigma-Aldrich also got objections for failing to provide information on a research project for chemicals during a 2015 merger review, it said. A third complaint went to Canon, which didn’t seek EU approval before implementing a Toshiba unit takeover last year.

“We can only do our job well if we can rely on cooperation from the companies concerned -- they must obtain our approval before they implement their transactions and the information they supply us must be correct and complete,” Vestager said.

While General Electric, and Merck and Sigma-Aldrich risk a fine of as much as 1 percent of annual worldwide turnover, Canon’s penalty could climb up to 10 percent of sales. The EU said however that the investigations won’t have impact its approval of the three mergers, which will remain effective.

EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager signaled a zero tolerance approach to companies that give inaccurate information when she fined Facebook Inc. 110 million euros on May 18 for combining WhatsApp data with its other services after having told the merger officials otherwise during the EU’s 2014 review. The social network said it acted in good faith and won a lower fine after cooperating with regulators.

GE’s push into the wind industry comes after the Boston-based firm took over Alstom Renewable Power Sector as part of its $10 billion acquisition of Alstom SA’s power operations two years ago. GE renamed the unit, which produces 6MW offshore wind turbines, GE Renewable Energy.

GE said the company “acted in good faith” with “no intent to mislead,” according to a statement, adding that it will continue its “constructive cooperation” with the EU.

The Commission also said in its preliminary view Canon used a so-called “warehousing” two-step transaction structure involving an interim buyer, which essentially allowed it to acquire Toshiba Medical Systems prior to obtaining the relevant merger approvals.

Japan’s Fair Trade Commission warned Canon last year for implementing the Toshiba deal before seeking regulatory approval.

Merck and St. Louis-based Sigma-Aldrich are suspected of failing to provide the commission with important information about an innovation project with relevance for certain laboratory chemicals at the core of the EU’s analysis.

Andrew Bailey, head of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, said banks and asset managers need certainty this year on how much time they’ll have to transition to the post-Brexit world in order to avert “regrettable” decisions made in haste.

Bailey said in London on Thursday that regulators should strive to preserve as much open access and free trade as possible as the U.K. withdraws from the European Union, and that transitional arrangements are necessary to allow for a “smooth path” to the new landscape.

“It would be regrettable all round if we put firms into this position where they feel they’re in a bind because they have to do practical implementation of contingency planning before they know the context in which they’re going to be working in the future,” Bailey said. “We need it to be known during the course of this year.”

The financial industry has made a transition one of its top priorities in Brexit talks to avoid a cliff-edge effect whereby EU rules cease to apply in the U.K. before new arrangements are in place. With the Brexit starting gun fired earlier this year, firms have begun activating plans to move operations from London.

Deutsche Bank AG is preparing to move large parts of the trading and investment-banking assets it currently books in London to its home town of Frankfurt in response to Brexit, people familiar with the matter said.

Marketo Inc. co-founder Phil Fernandez put his Silicon Valley company up for sale in 2016 with the expectation it would be folded into a technology giant.

SAP SE and Oracle Corp. had expressed interest in buying Marketo to bulk up on automated marketing software, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the process was private. With both willing to pay cash, it was highly unlikely a private equity firm could assemble a financing package quickly enough -- or pay an acceptable premium -- without putting its required return at risk.

Two months later, Vista Equity Partners LLC agreed to buy Marketo for $1.8 billion. The buyout firm leapfrogged the two corporate suitors now with a combined market value of more than $316 billion by pledging its $5.7 billion fund as collateral, one of the people said. Vista paid a 64 percent premium above Marketo’s unaffected share price, the value before the company’s sale process was reported by Bloomberg. SAP and Oracle representatives declined to comment.

The acquisition is one of several recent Vista deals targeting high-growth assets that aren’t conventionally suitable for private equity. Rather than zeroing in on efficiencies to boost the margins of software companies running legacy systems, the Austin-based firm is increasingly betting on unprofitable growth companies to chase returns. To out-pitch corporate competitors pursuing the same assets, Vista is willing to commit billions of dollars of equity from its funds, subtracting the vagaries of debt financing from the equation.

“When it comes to getting a deal done, price matters and certainty matters," Mike Wyatt, co-head of Morgan Stanley’s global technology mergers and acquisitions group. “Comparing price is straightforward. Comparing certainty is subjective. When someone like Vista takes the financing risk off the table, that de-risks the transaction for the seller.”

Whether Vista’s strategy will pay off remains to be seen. Its latest pool, Vista Equity Partners Fund VI LP, is less than two years old and largely still yet to be deployed. Vista can claim an enviable record since its inception in 2000, though. Four of its six earlier funds rank in the top quarter measured against its peers, with one in the second quarter and one in the third, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Vista declined to comment on its strategy and Fernandez didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Private equity firms typically can’t top strategics in contested acquisitions. Verizon Communications Inc., for example, triumphed with its $4.5 billion Yahoo! Inc. bid last year even though smaller firms offered more, people familiar with the matter said at the time. Verizon’s plan for merging Yahoo and AOL Inc. operations won the day over private equity firms saddled with the industry’s reputation for slashing costs to make returns, said the people.

Vista founder Robert F. Smith and the buyout firm’s backers have invested about $3 billion in equity on high-growth, high-valuation companies in the past two years, according to one of the people. Vista is specifically targeting companies showing at least 15 percent annualized growth in strategic technology verticals, the person said.

The day after announcing the Marketo deal, Vista drew from the same playbook to buy Ping Identity Corp. for $600 million, beating out CyberArk Software Ltd. to win the deal, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. A CyberArk representative declined to comment.

Increased Risk

Buying companies requiring higher investment levels -- for both products and staffing -- bucks the private equity blueprint of paying off debt with cash-generating assets. Having a larger equity component increases the risk and curtails the use debt for dividend re-capitalization, a tool that Vista and other private equity firms tap to make returns.

In a typical Vista deal, almost all aspects of the acquired company are subjected to reforms. Employees attend boot camps while old research-and-development projects are put on hold or dropped. Vista’s standard operating procedures, designed to rapidly and aggressively impose change, are spelled out in a handbook.

In contrast, Vista has taken a hands-off approach to Marketo, leaving it free to develop new products, according to one of the people familiar with the transaction. Operational screw tightening has been largely limited to areas such as real estate and accounting.

Second Phase

Vista can enact its traditional playbook as the companies mature under its ownership, said Ted Smith, co-founder of Union Square Advisors LLC, who has worked with Vista on several deals including a $4.3 billion takeover of Tibco Software Inc. in 2014.

“The traditional private equity thinking was, ‘Let’s take these slower growth, nicely profitable companies and layer debt on them right away, help them operationally, and sell them after we’ve used leverage to optimize our returns,”’ Smith said.

Vista has figured out how to buy companies with marginal or no profit and tap their fast growth to boost their size and income., he said. “At that point they can turn on the second phase of the rocket and treat them like a more traditional private equity purchase,” Smith said.

Vista’s strategy, with the backing of Smith and co-founder and President Brian Sheth, has been championed by Monti Saroya, a principal who has been with the firm since 2008, one of the people said.

Sole Focus

The firm’s sole focus on enterprise software eliminates another advantage of strategic acquires by giving it a stable of related companies and technology to fuel synergies, Smith said.

Last year, Vista acquired event management software company Cvent Inc. for $1.65 billion. The firm, which again outbid suitors including at least one large strategic bidder, put up most of the deal price in equity, one of the people said. Vista then merged Cvent with Lanyon, another of its portfolio companies, giving Cvent Chief Executive Officer Rajeev Aggarwal control of the combined entity.

The lower debt load -- a typical buyout is two-thirds debt -- coupled with a pledge of further investment gives Aggarwal the financial freedom to invest in customer service and building sales teams.

One feature of Vista’s playbook that remains the same is bringing in fresh management.

In Marketo’s case, Fernandez stepped down as CEO months after the buyout and was replaced by former SAP executive Steve Lucas. At Ping, Raj Dani was brought in as chief financial officer in November. He previously served in the same role at audio-visual group AVI-SPL, which has been backed by private equity firms HIG Capital and Silver Lake.

While Thoma Bravo and some other buyout firms have used similar strategies as Vista for high-growth technology assets, most still focus on traditional targets, relying on debt-financing models to generate returns. But expect them to become more comfortable committing more equity if they continue to lose out on deals, said Wyatt.

“When it’s about financial engineering, getting the right debt terms is essential,” Wyatt said. “In a high-growth deal, debt is important but the real difference maker is can you judge the business and manage it for long-term growth instead of short-term profits.”

When it comes to climate change, the Earth doesn’t cook evenly. But as cooler areas catch up, a study says things will get hotter faster.

Two climate scientists suggest they’ve come closer to resolving a critical debate about how quickly human activity will heat up the planet. The answer isn’t good news.

It’s almost universally understood that the Earth will continue to get warmer for the foreseeable future. The rate at which the planet warms, however, won’t remain the same, report Cristian Proistosescu and Peter Huybers of Harvard University. They say it’s likely to speed up.

Some parts of the planet heat up more slowly than others, they explain. But as more time passes, regions once less affected by global warming will get hotter. Thus, the bulk of planetary warming this century may actually be back-loaded onto its final decades.

The analysis, published Wednesday in Science Advances, addresses the gap between two long-battling camps struggling to understand how quickly the world will warm. One group looks at the historical record and projects into the future all the warming that has already been known to occur, mainly through direct observations. Those studies have found that, once there is twice as much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as there was prior to the industrial revolution, the temperature may rise between 1.6 degrees and 3 degrees Celsius (2.9 degrees to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit).

Those estimates, while unnerving, are significantly lower than the projections generated by climate models held up by the other group. These are built from equations supplied by Earth physics, and allow scientists to do something they can’t do in the real world—simulate how the planet behaves under various conditions over enormous periods of time. Computer models are the lab rats of climate science.

The contradictory evidence posited by the two camps was canonized in 2013, when the most authoritative climate-science group, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, broke with its own practice and declined to provide a single “best estimate” of warming. Instead it punted, providing only a range (from 1.5C to 4.5C) that extended the low end of the conflict below previous assessments.

Climate change may have two speeds, depending where you are on Earth

Why does this fight over a few degrees really matter? It’s crucial to estimate the warming rate as precisely as possible because the answer will dictate how aggressively global policymakers respond to the problem.

Each scientific camp though relies on different analytical methods, making comparisons difficult. The new study seeks to address that problem by breaking down previous studies into smaller components—an attempt to provide an “apples to apples comparison,” Proistosescu said.

The authors conclude that it’s worth considering two speeds of climate change. So far, the world has been in “fast” mode, in which regions likeliest to heat up fastest are showing the greatest increases in temperature. That includes land in the Northern Hemisphere. When it comes to analyzing global warming in the fast lane, both the observation camp and modeling camp agree, Proistosescu said.

There is also a “slow” mode. Places like the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and the Southern Ocean, which are colder relative to much of the rest of the world, take longer to warm. But warm they will. As the atmosphere traps more heat, their temperature will rise, and the overall rate of planetary warming will accelerate. Warming projections based only on historical observations assume the pace of climate change will remain the same; the new study says that as time goes on, things may get worse faster.

Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said that new paper provides independent backing for recent work from his unit and elsewhere. He concludes that projections of future warming derived from recorded temperature trends “are biased low.”

“Fixing that makes things line up much better,” Schmidt said.

Debate persists, however. Nicholas Lewis is an independent climate scientist who has published studies about climate sensitivity. He said he read the new paper before publication and tried to replicate its findings. Among many technical criticisms, eight models analyzed in the new study, he said, varied in quality. A better-quality range for the observations-only camp reaches from 1.65C to 1.9C, he said.

Meanwhile, Proistosescu's apples-to-apples analysis spans a more dangerous range, from 1.6C to 4C.

Part of the distance between the two camps may come from professional or philosophical differences over the utility of physics-based models to provide insight into the path of warming. There's no substitute for direct observation. And yet models strongly suggest the past has limited predictive value in circumstances moving—geologically speaking—this quickly.

Possible for nation to surpass record if weather good: Growers

Uganda, Africa’s third-biggest tea producer, increased its forecast for production for 2017 as rains earlier this year help revive a crop that had been damaged by drought.

Output may climb to 60 million kilograms (132 million pounds) from an initial forecast that production would hold steady at 56 million to 57 million kilograms from the previous year, George William Ssekitoleko, executive secretary of the Kampala-based Uganda Tea Association, said in a phone interview Thursday.

Rains from March to May rejuvenated the crop after drought last year and early this year cut yields, Ssekitoleko said. Also, “there has been increased planting, including introducing the crop in new areas,” he said.

It’s possible for the East African nation, with 40,000 hectares (99,000 acres) cultivated, to surpass record output of 66 million kilograms in 2014 if the weather is good, Ssekitoleko said.

Uganda exports at least 95 percent of its crop, mainly through the world’s biggest tea auction in Mombasa, Kenya, according to the association, which represents growers and exporters. Kenya and Malawi are the biggest tea producers in Africa.

The Ugandan unit of McLeod Russel India Ltd. accounts for about a quarter of the African nation’s production, according to the association.

The Primark budget fashion chain provided a bright spot in an otherwise struggling U.K. clothing industry, reporting a surge in sales as its low prices and a hot new trend helped draw hard-pressed consumers.

The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.

Primark’s U.K. same-store sales growth in the third quarter was considerably higher than a 2 percent rise in the first half, John Bason, chief financial officer of owner Associated British Foods Plc, said in an interview Thursday. Among the most popular lines were 10-pound ($13) inflatable flamingos as the retailer capitalized on one of the summer’s biggest crazes that has seen the pink birds emblazoned on everything from cushions to clocks.

“The U.K. in particular is showing very, very strong trading at the moment,” Bason said of Primark’s performance. “Against a background of what a lot of retailers have been reporting, I think we are a standout.”

The sales provide a contrast with the likes of Next Plc and Marks & Spencer Group Plc, whose clothing sales are stuttering as cash-strapped households look to the likes of Primark to make their money go further. It’s a similar story outside of fashion as discount grocers Aldi and Lidl continue to boost their share of food spending, while general-merchandise merchant B&M European Value Retail SA has also reported resurgent growth.

“The U.K. economy has gotten consistently more people into a job, but at a lower average real wage,” UBS analyst Andy Hughes said by phone. “That means people are seeking out more value wherever it might be.”

Primark’s sales gave a boost to shares of AB Foods, which rose as much as 6.2 percent in London, the biggest gain in eight months.

At constant currency rates, Primark’s sales advanced 13 percent in the first 40 weeks of the financial year, beating analyst estimates.

The chain has been able to secure more favorable purchasing rates with suppliers and mitigate pressure from the weakness of sterling more fully than it had expected, Bason said.

President Donald Trump said he is contemplating some "pretty severe things" to retaliate against North Korea after it launched an intercontinental ballistic missile this week that brings it closer to being able to hit the U.S. mainland.

“I have some pretty severe things we’re thinking about," Trump said at a news conference in Warsaw. "Doesn’t mean we’re going to do them. I don’t draw red lines."

"It’s a shame they’re behaving this way and they’re behaving in a very dangerous manner, and something will have to be done about it," Trump said.

Trump, who spoke alongside Polish President Andrzej Duda, offered no details about what he is considering and did not answer a question directly about whether is contemplating the use of military force. Earlier in the news conference, he said he is calling on all nations to "publicly demonstrate to North Korea that there are consequences for their very, very bad behavior."

Trump once again declined to say that it was only Russia that was involved in hacking the 2016 presidential election ahead of his meeting with Russia’s Vladimir Putin on Friday. U.S. intelligence agencies have blamed the Russian government but Trump has stopped short of laying blame squarely with the Kremlin.

"I think it was Russia, I think it could have been other countries," Trump said. "I won’t be specific."

He added: "So it was Russia and it was probably others also, and that’s probably been going on for a long period of time."

Talking to Putin

Trump’s aides have refused to say for certain that Trump will raise the issue with Putin directly.

On North Korea, U.S. officials confirmed that the country launched its first successful intercontinental ballistic missile test this week, just days before Trump was scheduled to travel to Europe for the G-20 summit in Germany.

The test, which follows several missile launches in recent months, has drawn the rebuke of several world leaders and increased pressure on Trump to take action to back up his rhetoric against the regime of Kim Jong Un.

Trump has previously said that “the era of strategic patience with the North Korea regime has failed’’ and “is over.”

Trump has said all options including military force are available against Pyongyang, though its neighbors warn a strike could be disastrous for North Asia. South Korea’s new government favors talks to bring Kim to heel, also putting it potentially at odds with Trump’s administration.

North Korea’s pursuit of a nuclear-tipped warhead capable of reaching the U.S. is likely to be a significant topic during the G-20. Trump is scheduled to have bilateral meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Moon Jae-In and Putin. Each of those leaders have spoken out against North Korea’s provocations, and Trump has leaned on China in particular to rein in the rogue regime but acknowledged recently that it’s not working.

~_~

When Chinese President Xi Jinping sits down with Donald Trump in Hamburg this week, he’ll confront a growing rift on how to rein in North Korea. Xi’s solution might be to put the onus back on the U.S.

The meeting on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit comes amid the U.S. president’s growing displeasure at what he sees as a lack of Chinese pressure on its ally, especially after Kim Jong Un announced his first test of a missile capable of reaching Alaska. “So much for China working with us - but we had to give it a try!” Trump said in a tweet Wednesday.

Still, Trump’s angst -- the U.S. is threatening trade ties with countries that do business with Pyongyang -- may not have the desired effect of getting China to tighten the economic noose. As much as China frets about Kim’s nuclear ambitions, bigger concerns for Xi are the prospects for military conflict on the Korean Peninsula or a chaotic collapse of the regime.

That could see the Chinese leader double down on his argument that talks are the best alternative to cycles of sanctions that have done little to deter Kim’s nuclear gambit -- and that discussions should start with direct U.S.-North Korea negotiations.

“The current sanctions approach that has been conducted in a piecemeal fashion has proven a failure,” Shi Yongming, an associate research fellow at the Foreign Ministry-run China Institute of International Studies in Beijing. “Right now, the most reasonable approach is to persuade the Americans and North Korea to talk directly.”

China’s concern about pushing Kim too hard shows how Trump, for all his tweeting, is grappling with the limits of his strategy on North Korea. He must now decide whether the test, coupled with the death last month of an American college student who had been imprisoned in North Korea, means giving up on collaboration and more directly confronting Beijing.

Speaking at a briefing in Warsaw on Thursday, Trump said the U.S. is considering “pretty severe things” on North Korea and "will confront" it very strongly for its behavior. Still, he added that did not mean the U.S. would indeed act against Pyongyang, saying he did not draw red lines like his predecessor Barack Obama.

‘Grave Concern’

Xi’s preference for dialogue doesn’t mean he isn’t worried about the growing military prowess of a country with a shared 1,300-kilometer (800-mile) border. The Foreign Ministry in Beijing expressed “grave concern” after Tuesday’s launch and called on nations involved to “stay calm and exercise restraint.”

China has said its ultimate goal is also to get Kim to lay down his nuclear weapons. But Xi reaffirmed his preference for talks this week, when he issued a joint statement with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow urging a return to “dialogue without preconditions.” They vowed to “work together and establish a comprehensive and effective security mechanism in Northeast Asia as early as possible.”

A push for direct negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea would represent a shift for China, which has long sought a seat at the table. While China has resisted U.S. demands to cut off vital food and energy exports to Kim’s regime, it has supported rounds of United Nations sanctions to force him back to the negotiating table.

Restarting Talks

The U.S. favors restarting the “six-party talks” -- including also Japan, Russia and South Korea -- that North Korea abandoned in 2009, if the regime agrees to halt its weapons program. Trump has suggested he might meet with Kim, but only under unspecified conditions. All but North Korea will be represented at the G-20 summit starting Friday in Hamburg.

“All North Korea wants to do is to talk to the U.S.,” Andrew Gilholm, director of North Asia analysis at Control Risks Group, said in Seoul. “There has to be a deal with the U.S. That is going to be harder because North Korea is more and more pushing acceptance of their nuclear status before they will even talk.”

Such a suggestion might not go over well with Trump. Even before Tuesday’s missile launch, Xi was complaining about “negative elements” affecting ties, after the U.S. signaled a harder line against on everything from trade to human rights.

After the missile test, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged global action against nations involved in “aiding and abetting” the regime. Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, warned Wednesday that North Korea’s actions were “quickly closing off the possibility of a diplomatic solution.”

“They have very different approaches toward the North Korean issue,” said Zhang Baohui, director of Lingnan University’s Center for Asian Pacific Studies in Hong Kong. “China and the U.S. are actually on a collision course, if Trump does shift to a tougher approach.”

“The recent ICBM test by North Korea may lead to grave instability in Sino-U.S. relations,” Zhang said.

For Kim, nuclear weapons may insure his regime against suffering the fates of governments in Iraq and Libya. One was listed alongside North Korea in former President George W. Bush’s “axis of evil.” The other fell in a U.S.-supported rebellion less than a decade after giving up its nuclear weapons.

Big Liability

Military action against North Korea would be far more dangerous, since Kim could launch conventional attacks against thousands of U.S. personnel and millions of civilians in South Korea and Japan. Each missile advancement raises the stakes for American civilians, as well.

Yang Xiyu, a former Chinese negotiator for the six-party negotiations, said Trump’s boasts about “China-U.S. togetherness” might have made Kim more provocative. North Korean state media have in recent months taken swipes at China for “dancing to the tune of the U.S.” and its “inhumane” sanctions.

“There is a perception that Pyongyang is a card Beijing holds to wield influence over the U.S.,” Yang said. “But it’s actually becoming such a big strategic liability to China, that Beijing’s seeking what it thinks is the most feasible way to handle a hot potato.”

They come with consequences the U.S. might not want to stomach

Donald Trump is grappling with the limits of his strategy to rely on China to get North Korea to limit its nuclear and ICBM programs following Kim Jong Un’s July 4 test of an intercontinental ballistic missile.

The U.S. president must now decide whether the test, coupled with the death last month of an American college student who had been imprisoned in North Korea, means giving up on collaboration and more directly confronting Beijing. Those advocating a hard line within the administration are emboldened by the recent North Korean actions, and the White House is weighing a series of gestures that could antagonize President Xi Jinping’s government.

But Trump’s options are limited by practical and economic realities. The president must calibrate a response that would prompt Chinese pressure on Kim without causing difficult repercussions for U.S. interests. Trump must also convince Beijing he’s willing to follow through on his threats, particularly after Chinese authorities appeared to shrug off promises to solve the North Korean issue on his own, if necessary.

Trump has expressed increasing exasperation with China on Twitter. “So much for China working with us - but we had to give it a try!” he said in a tweet on Wednesday.

Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter. So much for China working with us - but we had to give it a try! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 5, 2017

His United Nations ambassador, Nikki Haley, threatened on Wednesday to cut off U.S. trade with any nation that does business with North Korea. The U.S. will present a new resolution to punish North Korea for its missile test in coming days, Haley said during an emergency session of the UN Security Council.

“We will look at any country that chooses to do business with this outlaw regime,” Haley said.

Christopher Hill, who led U.S. talks with North Korea under former President George W. Bush, said the U.S. can get China to do more, “but it has to be in the context of working with China, not outsourcing to China.”

“We need to put our heads together with the Chinese,” Hill said in a phone interview. “Assuming we can’t get a responsible negotiation with the North Koreans, figure out what we can do together to slow up this movement toward nuclear weapons.”

So far, Trump’s approach is cautious escalation. The administration plans to increase pressure on China by letting the country know it can be squeezed on economic issues, including currency and trade, according to a State Department official who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The U.S. is also encouraging other allies to publicly declare how they’re working to cut off North Korea, seeking to build momentum on the world stage.

“I think the Chinese are afraid that if they really put the squeeze on Kim Jong Un he would do something desperate, he could cause a conflict, he could cause a war,” said Gary Samore, a former White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction under President Barack Obama.

“Or if North Korea did collapse you’d have chaos, North Korea being absorbed by the south, refugees fleeing across the border,” according to Samore, now the executive director for research at Harvard University’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.

If Trump does want to ratchet up direct pressure on China, he may move to increase sanctions on Chinese banks. In late June, the Treasury Department cut off the Bank of Dandong -- which operates 101 outlets in northeastern China and reported 78.3 billion yuan of assets ($11.6 billion) at the end of March -- from the international financial system because of its dealings with North Korea.

Bank Sanctions

Senator Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Wednesday that China should take note of the message.

"That ought to send a clear signal that we can do that with other Chinese banks and that’s going to hurt not only the economy of North Korea, but also hurt the economy of China, and maybe get China to take the actions that are necessary to get them to step in," Grassley said during an appearance on KXEL News/Talk radio in Waterloo, Iowa.

But China is likely to respond forcefully to any action that seriously impacts its banking sector. Chinese state media said Xi warned Trump that "negative factors" are hurting U.S.-China relations after the move to sanction the Bank of Dandong.

Trump could also take the largely symbolic step of labeling China a currency manipulator. In April, he violated a campaign promised by opting against the move, saying explicitly his reversal was meant to encourage China’s cooperation on North Korea.

“Why would I call China a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the North Korean problem? We’ll see what happens!” Trump said in an April 16 tweet, one day after the Treasury Department released its foreign-currency report.

Steel Tariffs

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is scheduled to host his Chinese counterpart for an annual economic meeting in Washington later this summer. Mnuchin has said he plans to hammer out trade, investment and other economic issues between the nations.

Trump could resort to another campaign promise -- protecting the U.S. steel industry -- to needle China. The president has ordered a review of the effect of steel imports on the U.S. economy, and recently has issued repeated public criticisms of the practice of steel dumping.

Those comments appear to explicitly aimed at China, which accounts for more than a quarter of the U.S. steel market. They may signal Trump’s willingness to impose new tariffs on Chinese steel.

That move carries its own problems: it would likely drive up steel prices for U.S. manufacturers and builders while also risking retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. Gary Cohn, the president’s top economic adviser, said Trump plans to raise the issue at this week’s G-20 summit in Germany, where Xi and Trump plan to hold a one-on-one meeting.

Military Action

The U.S. has increased its military presence in the Pacific in response to North Korean provocations, and increased activity there could also antagonize the Chinese.

The U.S. and South Korean militaries held a drill after Tuesday’s ICBM test, and China has repeatedly expressed anger over U.S. installation of a missile defense shield in South Korea. China was also piqued after the USS Stethem, a guided-missile destroyer, sailed within 12 nautical miles of a disputed island in the South China Sea. China has claimed sovereignty over the island, which was previously controlled by Vietnam, since 1974.

On Tuesday, China and Russia proposed that North Korea declare a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests if the U.S. and South Korea halt large-scale military exercises.

Hill said that such a deal would “fall unwittingly into the North Korean desire that somehow they can decouple the U.S. from South Korea and I think we ought to stand against that.”

“We should not be acceding to a Russian or Chinese idea that does the North Korean bidding for them,” he said.

The Flashpoints for World Leaders at the Hamburg G-20 Alan Crawford and Sam Dodge July 6, 2017 Byand

The Group of 20 summit that starts in Hamburg on Thursday is the most anticipated—and potentially turbulent—meeting of global leaders in years. An unpredictable U.S. president with a protectionist bent, a Russian leader subject to international sanctions and a Chinese president looking to assert a greater global role are just a few of the factors that might stoke tensions. Sparks could really ﬂy over the policy agenda of free trade, climate change and migration put forward by the German host. Angela Merkel is determined to avoid a repeat of May’s G-7 meeting in Italy, where it was six against one: Donald Trump. Yet she acknowledges that “the discord is obvious” and “it would be dishonest to paper over the conﬂict.” Following are what look to be the main flashpoints at the summit and the relative positions of G-20 members with most at stake:

Trade Open Markets For Germany Merkel U.K. May Brazil Temer Argentina Macri S. Korea Moon Jae-in U.S. Trump Against Open Markets For Against Germany Merkel U.K. May Brazil Temer Argentina Macri S. Korea Moon Jae-in U.S. Trump

United States: Donald Trump has shown his disdain for the status quo on world trade. He often describes trade as a zero-sum proposition in which the U.S. has been losing ground for decades and lambasts nations such as Germany that export more to the U.S. than they import as “very bad.” He seeks an overhaul of the global trading order that would elevate the U.S. at the expense of other countries. Germany: As head of Europe’s top exporting nation, Angela Merkel is under pressure to defend open markets and push back against criticism of Germany’s trade surplus. In the G-20 runup, the chancellor has tried to enlist countries from China and India to Mexico as free-trade allies and continues to push for completion of the TTIP trade deal between the EU and the U.S. United Kingdom: Aside from holding on to Downing Street, Theresa May has one thing in her inbox: Brexit. Once the U.K. leaves the EU—its biggest market—in 2019, it will live or die by signing free-trade deals, so May is desperate to make the case that Brexit Britain is “open for business.” Brazil: Says it is the best example of how protectionism has failed and that it now seeks open borders. President Michel Temer wants the ﬁnal G-20 document to emphasize the importance of multilateral trade rules and contain a speciﬁc mention of the WTO (which a Brazilian heads). Argentina: Only just reentered capital markets after 15 years of isolation, and President Mauricio Macri wants to strengthen trade ties with anyone willing to listen. He’s visited China, Japan, Germany and Davos, all in the name of business, and has expressed a desire to do more bilateral deals with or without the regional trade bloc Mercosur.

Climate Cutting Carbon Emissions For France Macron China Xi Germany Merkel India Modi Indonesia Widodo U.S. Trump Against Cutting Carbon Emissions For Against France Macron China Xi Germany Merkel India Modi Indonesia Widodo U.S. Trump

United States: The Trump administration has introduced measures to boost coal production and chipped away at environmental regulations while announcing the U.S. will withdraw from the Paris climate accords. At the G-7 last month, the U.S. declined to support a joint statement supporting global action against climate change. China: The world’s biggest polluter aims to occupy the ground the U.S. is vacating, and President Xi intends to put climate at the core of his G-20 agenda. France: Emmanuel Macron is a major defender of the Paris accord, frequently linking problems such as terrorism and migration to climate change and suggesting France may go further in its carbon targets as a result of the U.S. withdrawal. Germany: Angela Merkel, a former environment minister who helped forge the precursor to the Kyoto accord, is pushing for G-20 members to hold to the Paris agreement. While keen not to isolate Trump, she will ultimately have to decide if she takes him on over climate change. India: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has committed to the global agreement on curbing emissions and pledged to “go beyond the Paris accord,” saying “we have a common responsibility to protect our mother planet.”

Migration Freedom of Movement For Turkey Erdogan Mexico Nieto Italy Gentiloni S. Africa Zuma Australia Turnbull U.S. Trump Against Freedom of Movement For Against Turkey Erdogan Mexico Nieto Italy Gentiloni South Africa Zuma Australia Turnbull U.S. Trump

United States: Trump, who proposed building a U.S. border wall and signed a ban on travel for refugees and nationals from six Muslim-majority countries, has called for nations to have the authority to control migration. He has criticized Europeans for taking in so many migrants. Turkey: Hosts more refugees—almost 3 million—than any other country, mostly from war-torn neighboring Syria. That shared interest in migration means for all his public jibes at Merkel and threats to tear up a refugee deal with the EU, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan may have more in common with the German chancellor than with the U.S. president on this issue. Mexico: Immigrant rights have moved to the top of Mexico’s agenda after the U.S. threatened mass deportations of its citizens. Mexico participates in global refugee programs and has worked to limit the illegal crossing of Central Americans at its southern frontier. Italy: Migration is a priority for Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, whose Mediterranean country is struggling to cope with arrivals of refugees from North Africa and the Middle East. Italy has long felt abandoned by its European Union and other partners, and Gentiloni will be seeking more support for Merkel’s summit attempts to boost growth in Africa through foreign investment to help stem the outward ﬂows of people. South Africa: For President Jacob Zuma, the issue of migration is about people from mostly sub-Saharan countries such as Nigeria, Malawi, Zimbabwe and Ethiopia who are ﬂeeing war or grinding poverty. Recent years have seen outbreaks of deadly violence against foreigners by South Africans who say the migrants are taking their jobs and opportunities.

Trump Trump Policies For Saudi Arabia Salman Russia Putin Japan Abe Canada Trudeau France Macron Against Trump Policies For Against Saudi Arabia Salman Russia Putin Japan Abe Canada Trudeau France Macron

Russia: Vladimir Putin has repeatedly praised Trump, who campaigned on a pledge to build better relations with Russia. But Putin has watched with growing concern as investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the U.S. vote have further poisoned relations and Moscow’s opponents in the U.S. have pushed for new sanctions on Russia. Japan: Abe was the ﬁrst to visit Trump after Trump won the White House, even golﬁng with the president. But Abe has also taken care to stress Japan’s investments in the U.S. economy and defended the status of trade ties, including Japanese auto exports. Saudi Arabia: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was one of the ﬁrst foreign ofﬁcials to visit Trump as president, allowing Saudi Arabia to claim “a historic turning point” in relations. Trump chose Saudi Arabia as the ﬁrst destination on his ﬁrst foreign trip as president, saying that his meetings there with regional leaders were “beyond anything anyone has seen.” France: Emmanuel Macron crushed Trump’s hand the ﬁrst time they met and hasn’t hesitated to take him on since, almost trolling the U.S. leader when he announced his withdrawal from the Paris accords. But he’s invited the president to attend the July 14 Bastille Day celebrations—and Trump accepted. Canada: Justin Trudeau may ﬁnd himself a hot commodity at the G-20 with other leaders looking to pick the Canadian premier’s brain for how to deal with his neighbor. With Nafta talks due to begin in August, Trudeau’s cabinet has fanned out to lobby the White House, Congress and key U.S. governors to ward off proposals for a border tax or new trade tariffs.

Manhattan homebuyers found deals they couldn’t refuse in the second quarter, driving up sales of previously owned properties by the most in more than two years.

Purchases of resale homes jumped 16 percent from a year earlier to 2,597, according to a report Thursday by appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. and brokerage Douglas Elliman Real Estate. Buyer interest was fueled by average price cuts of 6.1 percent across all property types. The last time the average discount was larger was the third quarter of 2012, when it was 7.2 percent.

Sellers of luxury apartments took the whittling further, cutting prices by an average of 10 percent, the most since the end of 2010 and the second-biggest discounts in more than 16 years of record-keeping.

“The sellers definitely got it,” said Diane Ramirez, chief executive officer of brokerage Halstead Real Estate, which released its own report Thursday saying there was a 28 percent jump in resales in the second quarter. “They said, ‘We’ve got buyers out there who are serious but that are not moving forward, so let’s give them a reason to move forward.’”

Manhattan home shoppers held back last year, uninspired to commit to a purchase when sellers were holding fast to their lofty asking prices, even as inventory climbed. A rising stock market since the U.S. presidential election sparked fresh interest in browsing, and sellers sensed an opportunity to offload apartments that had been lingering.

Last quarter’s sales increase was the biggest since the first quarter of 2015, when they jumped 22 percent. Properties that sold in the second quarter spent an average of 108 days on the market, compared with 89 days in the same period last year, Miller Samuel and Douglas Elliman said. Luxury homes, defined as the top 10 percent of deals by price, were listed for 231 days on average before finding buyers, up from 169 days in the second quarter of 2016.

Buyer interest jumped across all property types and price ranges, lifting the overall median price of completed deals and chipping away at some of the inventory. The median price of resales climbed 3.2 percent from a year earlier to $975,000, while the luxury median rose 3.5 percent to $6.84 million, Miller Samuel and Douglas Elliman said.

There were 5,290 previously owned homes listed for sale at the end of the second quarter, or 1.3 percent fewer than a year earlier, the firms said. Some were sold and some owners just gave up.

“Those sellers who refused to get the message took their properties off the market,” Steven James, CEO of Douglas Elliman’s New York City division, said in an interview.

Contracts Decline

The frenzy might not last though. Contracts to buy homes in Manhattan fell 8 percent in the quarter from a year earlier to 3,258, brokerage Corcoran Group said in its own report Thursday. Corcoran cited the high price of the remaining supply as one reason for the decline.

Buyers also aren’t showing much urgency to close a deal, Frederick Peters, CEO of Warburg Realty, said in a note this week discussing the market in the second quarter. These days, shoppers negotiating a price aren’t worried they’ll forfeit a deal if they wait out a weekend or vacation before responding to a seller’s terms, he wrote in his note.

While bidding wars still happen, there were fewer instances where buyers agreed to pay more than the seller was seeking. Fourteen percent of all completed deals in the second quarter were above the listed price, compared with 16 percent a year earlier, Miller Samuel and Douglas Elliman said. For luxury properties, the figure was 3.5 percent.

“Our market cannot support aspirational pricing by sellers waiting for that ‘one buyer’ who will overpay for their home,” Warburg’s Peters said in his note. “Buyers are as price-conscious as I have ever seen them.”

Oil clawed back some of its biggest loss in four weeks after data showed U.S. stockpiles declining, while European bonds slipped before the release of minutes from the ECB. Gold fell and major currencies were largely steady.

American government data Thursday is also forecast to show crude supplies fell, helping West Texas oil climb back toward $46 per barrel. Oil and gas shares in Europe rose, but the Stoxx Europe 600 Index edged lower amid a slump of travel and leisure stocks. Gold’s retreat followed two days of gains.

Focus on Thursday will likely be on minutes from the latest European Central Bank meeting, and on private jobs data in the U.S. Minutes from the Fed showed a lack of consensus about when to shrink the central bank’s $4.5 trillion balance sheet, and how to approach policy strategy in a time of low inflation.

Steven Major, head of fixed income research at HSBC, discusses the Fed

“With the mixed tone from the minutes and the essential delay to the announcement of balance-sheet reduction timing, there is no surprise why we are seeing the muted reaction,” said Jingyi Pan, a market strategist at IG Asia Pte. “Nevertheless, as things stand, the Fed’s rhetoric still points toward confidence in economic conditions.”

Here’s what’s coming up:

The ECB minutes may provide clues on whether the bank is closer to tightening policy.

The ADP employment report today is unlikely to sustain the recent pace of growth, with consensus expecting 185,000 new private jobs in June, down from 253,000 in May.

The G-20 summit in Hamburg starts Friday. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to hold his first meeting with Russia’s Vladimir Putin as well as meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.

And Friday will also see the U.S. Labor Department report official jobs figures. American employers probably added around 175,000 workers in June and wage growth probably strengthened, consistent with a solid labor market, economists project.

These are the main moves in markets:

Stocks

The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.6 percent as of 10:54 a.m. in London.

Futures on the S&P 500 Index declined 0.3 percent after the underlying gauge rose 0.2 percent Wednesday and the Nasdaq 100 index jumped 0.9 percent.

Currencies

The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed.

The euro was steady at $1.1364 and the British pound strengthened 0.1 percent to $1.2946.

Bonds

The yield on 10-year Treasuries rose four basis points to 2.37 percent, after falling three basis points Wednesday.

German 10-year yields climbed seven basis points while French peers rose six basis points and those on gilts added four.

Commodities

West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 1.3 percent to $45.71 a barrel. The contract dropped 4.1 percent Wednesday, the most in four weeks, as Russia was said to oppose any proposal to deepen OPEC-led production cuts.

Gold lost 0.2 percent to $1,224.68 an ounce, after two days of gains.

Noble Group Ltd., the commodity trader that’s struggling for survival after a multiyear stock rout and concerns it may default, surged in Singapore, with shares hitting their highest close since May amid speculation that large investors may be building stakes.

Stock in the Hong Kong-based company advanced as much as 38 percent to 65 Singapore cents and closed at 64 cents. While the company has rebounded from an intraday low of 28.5 cents on June 6, it’s still lost more than 60 percent this year.

The jump prompted a query from Singapore Exchange Ltd. In response, the company said it wasn’t aware of any information not previously announced that might explain the trading.

Noble Group is searching for a strategic investor to restore confidence after the collapse in its shares and bonds, and last month it reached an agreement with core banks to extend a key credit facility for 120 days. Goldilocks Investment Co., an Abu Dhabi fund, is among the company’s new holders after building up a 5 percent stake over two days in June.

“We can’t rule out the possibility that some big players are probably accumulating the shares,” Margaret Yang, a strategist at CMC Markets, said by phone. “But usually they’ll have to disclose, like what the Middle East fund was doing last time.” She added: “All this is just speculation, but the volume is really there.”

Shares Traded

A total of 124 million shares were traded, the busiest day since June 20, when Goldilocks Investment completed the purchase of its stake. The $200 million fund is controlled by investor Jassim Alseddiqi’s Abu Dhabi Financial Group, which has said it would target undervalued opportunities in the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries.

Nicholas Teo, a trading strategist at KGI Securities (Singapore) Pte, said the stock surge may have been triggered by technical trading. The gains followed once a recent high of 52 cents was breached, according to Teo.

Noble Group’s perpetual bonds traded up 0.6 cents at 15.5 cents, for the biggest rise in nearly two weeks, while the bonds due 2020 were up 0.4 cent to 38.4 cents, the biggest gain in over a week, according to Bloomberg-compiled prices.

Lawyers for Noble Group have been in Singapore’s High Court this week to challenge a lawsuit brought by a former chief executive office, Ricardo Leiman, who claims he’s owed in unpaid shares and bonus.

Qatar Airways Ltd. joined other major carriers in the Middle East in securing exemption from measures barring the use of laptops and other large electronic devices in the cabins of U.S.-bound aircraft.

Personal devices can now be carried on all flights from Doha’s Hamad International Airport after the hub met the requirements of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Qatar Air said in a statement Thursday.

Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.

Escaping the ban has been viewed as vital for carriers after the measures led some customers to switch to airlines where they could still use their laptops, tablets and games consoles. The Abu Dhabi headquarters of Etihad Airways was first to see the curbs lifted last Sunday, aided by the presence of a U.S. “pre-clearance” border post there, with both Dubai-based Emirates and Turkish Airlines of Istanbul declaring themselves free of the measues Wednesday.

Other airports among the 10 affected by the U.S. ban are also moving toward a resolution, with Saudi Arabia Airlines saying Tuesday that it expects to be free of the restrictions by July 19. Amman-based Royal Jordanian has also asked the U.S. Transportation Security Administration to approve its response to the requirement for stricter security scans and checks.

Egypt is taking steps to meet the guidelines, with Cairo airport installing new equipment, Sherif Fathy, the country’s aviation minister, said in an interview Thursday. Fathy didn’t suggest a timeline for the lifting of the curbs.

The U.S. announced the ban on personal devices in March, citing concerns about them potentially being used in terrorist attacks, immediately followed by Britain. The U.K. restrictions -- which apply to cities including Istanbul, but not the Persian Gulf hubs -- remain in place for now, the Department for Transport said Thursday in response to questions from Bloomberg.

In the multicultural days of The Apprentice, he rose to a level of popularity with minorities that the GOP could only dream of. Then he torched it all to prepare for a hard-right run at the presidency.

Donald Trump had been thinking about running for president for more than 20 years before he locked onto the twin issues of race and immigration that vaulted him to the White House. Trump’s presidency, and the toxic civic culture it ushered in, will forever be linked to these issues.

History could have been different. While Trump always displayed populist instincts, his opinions on national affairs tended to reflect the views of a New York Democrat, which was, after all, the world he inhabited. It’s almost impossible to imagine now, but in the period just before he entered politics, Trump’s appeal to blacks and Hispanics was powerful enough to make him the darling of corporate America. Although he was not a politician, Trump’s multicultural appeal was an achievement that a sclerotic Republican Party was increasingly desperate to match.

One reason this story has never been told is because Trump decided he’d be better served politically by destroying this legacy. He wasn’t exactly wrong: His “birther” attack on President Obama in 2011, when Trump was eyeing a 2012 run, marked a sharp pivot on race and then immigration that enabled his remarkable rise to the presidency.

On Jan. 8, 2004, viewers of NBC’s prime-time television lineup got the first glimpse of a show soon to become a cultural sensation. As a crow’s-eye view of the Manhattan skyline floated across the screen, Donald Trump’s unmistakable voice, all steely self-confidence, laid out the premise of his new series: “New York. My city. Where the wheels of the global economy never stop turning.” The perspective jumps to the back seat of a limousine and a familiar figure: “My name is Donald Trump, and I’m the largest real estate developer in New York. I own buildings all over the place, model agencies, the Miss Universe pageant, jetliners, golf courses, casinos.” As he climbs out of the limousine toward a “Trump”-emblazoned helicopter that awaits him, he delivers the payoff: “I’ve mastered the art of the deal, and I’ve turned the name Trump into the highest-quality brand. As the master, I want to pass along my knowledge to somebody else. I’m looking for … the apprentice.”

Right out of the gate, The Apprentice was a hit. During its first season, the show drew an average of more than 20 million viewers a week. It was the dawn of the reality-TV era, and Trump’s cartoonish persona lent itself perfectly to the new medium. Each week, Trump would preside from what appeared to be a luxe, walnut-lined boardroom high up in Trump Tower. Each week, at the end of the show, Trump would dispatch one of the contestants with his signature phrase: “You’re fired!”

NBC executives were thrilled by the surprise hit on their hands. Until The Apprentice, the network hadn’t managed to develop a successful reality-TV franchise, and it was falling behind its major competitors, CBS (Survivor, Big Brother) and ABC (The Mole). Trump’s success was all the more important to NBC because the show aired in a critical time slot—Thursday prime time—that for years had boasted a powerhouse lineup, most recently anchored by the ensemble comedy Friends. But by the spring of 2004, Friends was finishing up its final season. To NBC’s great relief, The Apprentice reached out and took the baton.

The show’s fast success produced significant economic benefits for the network. It did so for Trump, too—but it also did something more. It indelibly established his national image. Mark Burnett, the show’s creator, had originally sold the concept to NBC as one where Trump would host The Apprentice for only the first season, after which he would give way to a succession of iconic business moguls, such as Richard Branson, Mark Cuban, or Martha Stewart. That idea quickly fell by the wayside. “After the first episode,” Jeff Gaspin, who ran reality programming for NBC, told the Washington Post, “we said we want more Trump.”

Trump’s power to draw a mass audience during prime time was vital by the mid-2000s, when the major networks began losing audience share to cable television and other online outlets. The fact that he could reliably hold huge swaths of viewers made it easy for NBC to line up major advertisers: McDonald’s, Pepsi, Home Depot, Visa, Ford Motor, Capital One Financial, Kellogg’s, Panasonic, and many other blue chip corporations advertised during The Apprentice, several of them continuing to do so for the show’s entire decade-long run. The fact that Trump’s 20 million viewers were tuning in on Thursday nights also made The Apprentice the perfect destination for Hollywood studios keen to advertise the new films they would be debuting over the weekend.

But there was an additional aspect of Trump’s appeal that received almost no mainstream media attention—and yet was a key part of why advertisers found his show so desirable, and why Trump, even though he was politically dormant during this period, managed to build a national profile that was dramatically different from any other major Republican figure, then or since: Trump was extremely popular with minority audiences.

“I think most people thought they really knew Donald Trump.”

Because The Apprentice drew a mass audience that pulled in an especially high proportion of black and Hispanic viewers, Fortune 500 companies seeking to reach these particular demographics could advertise on the show and get the best of both worlds. “First and foremost, advertisers are buying the absolute number—and he got really good numbers,” says Eric Leininger, who was chief marketing officer at McDonald’s in 2004. “Secondly, they’re buying against particular demographics. And it’s easier for a company like McDonald’s to buy a program that has a big audience, as opposed to having to aggregate an audience by buying five smaller ones. If you can have a mass program that brings you a diverse audience, that’s a beautiful thing.”

It quickly became apparent that the appeal of The Apprentice to minority audiences was rooted not just in the manufactured drama of a business competition but in Trump himself and the world he projected. “As an active marketer watching the show, the beautiful thing about The Apprentice was that it was a wonderfully integrated program,” says Monique Nelson, chief executive officer of UniWorld Group Inc., an advertising agency focused on minority audiences with two clients, Home Depot and Ford, that advertised on The Apprentice. “There were always people of color, women, people from all different backgrounds—so it connects. The one thing we know about marketing is that when you see a character that reminds you of yourself, you get invested.”

What’s more, Trump and the show’s creators featured their minority contestants in a role that departed from how minority characters were historically portrayed on television and in movies: The Apprentice presented them as striving, ambitious entrepreneurs. Although she was “fired” from the show in Week 9, Omarosá Manigault-Stallworth, a black graduate student at Howard University who had held a low-level White House job for Vice President Al Gore, was the breakout star of The Apprentice’s debut season, styling herself into what remains the epitome of the reality-TV villain. In the show’s fourth season, which aired in the fall of 2005, Randal Pinkett, a black business consultant and a Rhodes Scholar, won the overall title and became the Apprentice. People noticed.

“They did a wonderful job of showing America as it was even then: multiethnic, multiracial, and multigenerational,” says Nelson. “[The show] appealed to companies looking to reach minority audiences, and it did it authentically, without trying too hard. That means everything in marketing. You always saw a nice swath of America through that business lens.”

This popularity extended to Trump himself, who, according to private demographic research conducted at the time, was even more popular with black and Hispanic viewers than he was with white audiences. “He was getting so much exposure from the prime-time show, and getting good ratings on NBC, that both his positive perception and his negative perception were well above average,” says Henry Schafer, executive vice president of the Q Scores Co., an opinion research firm that serves advertisers by measuring the familiarity and appeal of celebrities and television shows and distilling them into a “Q Score.” “He was the kind of vivid character that I would put in the same category as the Kardashians, Martha Stewart, and Howard Stern: celebrities you love to hate.”

At his peak in 2010, Trump’s positive Q Score with black audiences was 27, while his positive score among English-speaking Hispanic audiences reached 18. Among nonblack audiences, however, Trump’s positive Q Score was just 8. White audiences, along with everybody else, tuned in to watch Trump—but either they didn’t particularly like him or they simply loved to hate him. Either way, says Schafer, “he definitely had a stronger positive perception among blacks and Hispanics.”

This perception became even more valuable as the series continued because it dovetailed with a marketing strategy just then coming into vogue in corporate America that was known as “visual diversity”—the idea being that advertisers could run commercials designed to convey the message that corporate America was not merely in touch with a racially diverse country but was itself an active (and inclusive!) participant.

Well into its run, The Apprentice was viewed by corporate America as the epitome of the forward-thinking, multicultural programming that all advertisers were increasingly seeking, especially after the election in 2008 of a biracial president. Just as Barack Obama symbolized the country’s uplifting racial progress, advertisers were “also tapping into that same yearning, particularly among younger Americans, to put racial divisions behind us and move forward in a more unified way,” Danny Allen, a top executive at the multi­cultural-focused ad agency Sensis, declared in 2009. As unlikely as it sounds from the vantage point of today, Trump and The Apprentice, up through the end of the decade, were considered by advertisers and audiences alike to be a triumph of American multiculturalism.

As a celebrity and a pop-culture icon, Trump was riding higher than ever. But privately he was obsessing over politics. Nobody knew it yet, but soon enough they would—because Trump was about to do something that any ordinary Republican with an eye on the White House would consider reckless to the point of insanity: He was about to torch his relationship with minority voters.

Trump had achieved by 2010 what Republican politicians had struggled, without success, to accomplish for the better part of 50 years. He had made himself genuinely popular with a broad segment of blacks and Hispanics. This audience didn’t think of him as a politician, of course. Not yet. But as a starting point in a bid for higher office, Trump was already out on the far horizon of where the Republican Party one day hoped to be.

Truth be told, the party was moving in entirely the wrong direction. Ever since 1964, when Barry Goldwater championed “states’ rights”—understood to signify his opposition to the civil rights movement—minority voters had turned their backs on the Republican Party. Richard Nixon’s “Southern strategy”—stoking white racism for electoral gain—had only cemented this state of affairs. In the 11 presidential elections that followed Goldwater’s thumping loss, no Republican had won more than 15 percent of the black vote. And in the most recent election, in 2008, exit polls showed that John McCain had pulled a meager 4 percent of them. Republicans fared slightly better among the fast-growing population of Hispanic voters, with George W. Bush hitting a high point of 44 percent in 2004. But here, too, the GOP was backsliding: McCain had carried just 31 percent of Hispanics. Republican strategists looking toward the future were already growing nervous because the changing demography of the U.S. made perfectly clear that minorities would steadily increase as a share of the eligible electorate. Republicans needed to win more of them.

Trump was the furthest thing from a racial innocent. In 1989, after five black and Hispanic male teenagers from Harlem were accused of raping a white female jogger in Central Park, he had felt it necessary to spend $85,000 running full-page ads in the New York daily newspapers calling for the return of the death penalty. “Muggers and murderers,” he wrote, “should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes.” (Even after DNA evidence exonerated the Central Park Five, Trump refused to apologize and held fast to his insistence that they were guilty.) And yet, however improbable, he had managed to win the good favor of millions of minority voters.

What was it, then, that impelled Trump to suddenly start questioning Barack Obama’s citizenship and implying that he wouldn’t produce a birth certificate because he hadn’t really been born in the U.S.? And not just air his suspicion that Obama was born in Kenya but conduct a full-scale media blitzkrieg that took him from Fox News to ABC’s The View to drive home this fantastical narrative?

Trump himself would never say. But knowing now that his presidential ambitions were serious—and not simply a ratings stunt, as we assumed at the time—it seems clear that he was considering challenging Obama in 2012 and had an inkling of the power he could marshal by highlighting the president’s otherness to appeal to anti-Obama voters. The birther charge had been circulating for some time in the darker corners of the internet, on right-wing conspiracy sites, and in email chains. As someone possessing perhaps the best raw political instincts of any Republican in his generation, Trump had intuited, correctly, that a racist attack targeting a black president was the surest way to ingratiate himself with grass-roots Republican voters. And so Trump, without batting an eye, proceeded to destroy the goodwill he had built up with minority voters as a way of appealing to a new audience. (Only under great duress, when it was clearly hampering his presidential campaign, did he grudgingly withdraw the charge during a bizarre press conference, surrounded by ex-generals, that was staged in the lobby of his Washington, D.C., hotel two months before the election.)

The effect was almost immediate, and the first place it showed up was in Trump’s television ratings. In the spring of 2011, as his birther crusade took off in earnest, NBC was airing a new season of The Celebrity Apprentice. According to research conducted by National Media Inc., a firm that places political ads on television, the audience that tuned in to it was among the most liberal in all of prime-time television, owing in no small part to the large number of minority viewers that Trump attracted. As he broadcast his birther charge against Obama, Nielsen ratings for The Celebrity Apprentice took a sharp turn for the worse. “Given the downward trend of Trump’s ratings among his current, liberal audience,” joked Will Feltus, a Republican ad buyer, “maybe he’s running as a Republican to add a little bipartisan diversity to his viewership.”

The effect of Trump’s attacks was even more pronounced on his personal image. His favorability rating with minority viewers began to collapse. Trump’s positive Q Score among blacks fell from its high of 27, in 2010, to 21 the next year, then to 10, and to 9, before bottoming out at 6 in 2014. That same year, his negative Q Score, which had floated in the 30s, skyrocketed to 55. (It’s hardly unusual for a once-­popular celebrity to have a higher negative Q Score than a positive one—in fact, Bill Cosby, who hit a record-high positive Q Score of 71 in the 1980s, is now deeply underwater, says Q Scores’ president, Steven Levitt.) Hispanics—not yet a Trump target—also soured on the Apprentice host. While his positive Q rating among English-speaking Hispanics roughly held steady in the teens, his negative rating soared into the mid-40s.

“He knew who his audience was going to be—it was not going to be people who want to have policy debates. It was going to be older people, people who work with their hands.”

“I think most people thought they really knew Donald Trump,” says Q Scores’ Schafer. “With his show, it was an emotional pact with the audience.” When minority audiences perceived Trump to have broken that pact, their judgment was severe. Q Scores doesn’t measure the popularity of elected politicians; it rates only people whom it considers to be celebrities and entertainers. (It stopped measuring Trump after 2015, when he became a politician.) But among nonpolitical celebrities, Trump’s favorability dropped to the bottom of the barrel. “We don’t do folks like David Duke—not unless he had a show somewhere,” says Schafer. “But toward the end, Donald Trump’s negative rating with black audiences was the second-worst of any celebrity we measured. Do you know who the only guy was they hated worse? It was ‘the Situation’ from Jersey Shore.”

From a raw political standpoint, Trump’s decision to adopt a set of views that offended and alienated minority voters, ugly though it was, turned out well for him. He would soon go further, broadening his attacks to include illegal immigrants. Trump did so at precisely the moment when Republican leaders, led by party chairman Reince Priebus (Trump’s future chief of staff), released an “autopsy” of Mitt Romney’s defeat that included a detailed plan for how the party could recover. Its most important recommendation was that Republicans embrace comprehensive immigration reform in order to broaden their appeal to minority voters. In so many words, Republican leaders were telling their rank and file they needed to be more like Trump during his Apprentice glory days—while Trump was arriving at the opposite conclusion. Several years earlier, he’d been introduced to his future chief strategist Steve Bannon, who was then the executive chairman of the right-wing populist website Breitbart News. An anti-immigration zealot, Bannon eagerly encouraged Trump to do everything he could to build a political movement around white identity politics.

A wily manipulator of public sentiment whose New York upbringing taught him the power of racial resentment, Trump understood exactly what he was doing in leveling the birther attack. As he rose to the top of Republican primary polls in the spring of 2011, his instincts were borne out. But he never accepted the trade-off he’d made. By the commutative property of Trump’s exalted self-­image, blacks and Hispanics still supported him with the same zeal they had during his Apprentice heyday—of this he was certain—and if the Nielsen ratings and poll numbers didn’t back him up, then anecdotal evidence would suffice. A few days after locking up the GOP nomination in May 2016, Trump, sitting high up in his Trump Tower office, parried a question about his poor image with minority voters by insisting that he was as popular as ever: “A radio announcer, a Hispanic from New York, said, ‘I don’t know about these polls, because every listener that I have’—they call in Spanish—‘they’re all for Trump!’ I think I’m going to do very well with Hispanics.”

Whether or not he was deluding himself, Trump really had once looked poised to perform better among minority voters than any Republican since Dwight Eisenhower—at least on paper. His multicultural appeal in 2010 raises the intriguing thought that Trump could have run an entirely different sort of campaign, one that drew on his strength with a set of voters Republicans don’t typically command and that sought to build on the diverse, entrepreneurial image of his TV show. “There was a time,” UniWorld’s Nelson points out, “where he was talking to everyone.” Had he been so inclined, Trump could have run a forward-looking campaign to “Make America Greater” rather than alluding to the past with “Make America Great Again.” Instead he plunged deeper into the racial morass.

One reason Trump’s success in the 2016 election cycle came as such a shock is that his nascent political career was thought to have come to an abrupt and humiliating finish five years earlier. In 2011, at the height of the birther craze, Trump was invited to the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, by Lally Weymouth, the daughter of the Washington Post’s legendary publisher Katherine Graham.

Ever since 1987, when, in the wake of the Iran-Contra scandal, the journalist Michael Kelly brought one of its central figures, Fawn Hall, the documenting-shredding secretary to Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, there had been an unspoken competition among prestige media outlets to land the most notorious and newsworthy guests. In the social context of elite Washington, the Post’s nabbing Trump as a guest was a coup. And Trump was, by all accounts, delighted to be among the actors, starlets, and television personalities who flock to the A-list dinner each year.

Trump was seated in the very center of the Hilton ballroom, his confection of blond hair aglow in the bright lights, his star wattage eclipsing the graying eminences of journalism and politics who craned their necks to get a look at him. No one confronted him about his birther attacks or questioned why he was so intent on humiliating Obama, since doing so would have run counter to the spirit of the evening. Instead, Trump schmoozed and flattered his fellow guests and they, in turn, schmoozed and flattered him.

The president and his staff would not be so solicitous. They had, in fact, been eagerly awaiting Trump’s arrival in Washington from the moment the news became public, recognizing the occasion as the perfect opportunity to exact revenge. Obama’s writing staff even brought in a ringer, the comedian and director Judd Apatow, to help compose a devastating takedown of Trump.

Toward the end of the evening, when the lights dimmed for Obama’s remarks, giant screens throughout the ballroom broadcast a blaring music video of Rick Derringer’s cheesy rock anthem Real American that the White House digital strategy team had crammed full of over-the-top patriotic imagery: rippling American flags, screaming eagles, Uncle Sam—and then Obama’s long-form birth certificate came dancing across the screen. The White House had just released it three days earlier, after months of Trump’s haranguing suggestion that Obama couldn’t produce it because he hadn’t really been born in Hawaii.

As the lights came up, Obama stood at the podium grinning broadly and looking right at Trump. “My fellow Americans, mahalo!” he said. “As some of you heard, the State of Hawaii released my official long-form birth certificate. Hopefully this puts all doubts to rest. But just in case there are any lingering questions, tonight I’m prepared to go a step further. Tonight, I am releasing my official birth video.”

Now the screens showed a clip of Disney’s The Lion King bearing a time stamp that read Aug. 4, 1961—Obama’s birthday. The crowd hooted and laughed.

“Donald Trump is here tonight,” the president announced. “Now, I know he’s taken some flack lately. But no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the Donald. And that’s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter, like … did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?”

The crowd laughed louder. Trump sat frozen in a rictus grin.

Obama kept after him: “All kidding aside, obviously we all know about your credentials and breadth of experience, um”—here Obama paused to let the laughter die down—“No seriously, just recently, in an episode of Celebrity Apprentice, at the steakhouse, the men’s cooking team did not impress the judges from Omaha Steaks. There was a lot of blame to go around. But you, Mr. Trump, recognized that the real problem was a lack of leadership, and so ultimately you didn’t blame Lil Jon or Meatloaf—you fired Gary Busey.”

Saturday Night Live’s Seth Meyers was up next. After methodically working through the field of 2012 Republican presidential hopefuls, he arrived at his real target. “And then, of course, there’s Donald Trump,” Meyers said, with a devilish grin. “Donald Trump has been saying that he will run for president as a Republican—which is surprising, because I just assumed that he was running as a joke.”

Trump reddened.

“Donald Trump often appears on Fox,” Meyers continued, “which is ironic, because a fox often appears on Donald Trump’s head. If you’re at the Washington Post table with Trump and can’t finish your entree, don’t worry: The fox will eat it.”

More laughter.

Gone from Trump’s visage was any pretense that he was enjoying this. Trump was plainly humiliated—and it showed. When Meyers finished, Trump, looking shaken, beat a hasty retreat. He had been “incredibly gracious and engaged on the way in,” Marcus Brauchli, the Post’s executive editor, would later say, but after his drubbing, Trump had departed the dinner “with maximum efficiency.”

To all outward appearances, Trump had just been brutally dispatched—his dignity snatched away from him, his foray into politics swiftly cut short, the preening, grasping interloper who had barged into a world where he didn’t belong sent crawling back to his rightful station: a tawdry world of bimbos, pink marble, reality TV, and Page Six. This is what all of Washington understood to have happened, for years afterward: Trump had made another of his absurd periodic displays of pretending to contemplate a run for president, ventured too far in his quest for publicity, and suffered a terminal humiliation. Now the universe had snapped back into balance and ejected him.

Only that wasn’t what had happened at all. After his excommunication at the 2011 White House Correspondents’ Dinner, Trump fell off the mainstream political radar, save for his periodic appearances on Fox News. Despite the outcry over the birther issue, only a single corporate advertiser, Groupon, bailed on The Apprentice. For people who read newspapers and watched the evening news, Trump appeared to have left politics safely behind. But in the parallel world of right-wing websites and talk radio, he was gaining a loyal following.

Trump was no longer “talking to everyone.” Now he was talking solely to the conservative grass roots and saying wildly polarizing things.

One of Trump’s most faithful attendants during this period was Christopher Ruddy, the publisher of Newsmax Media Inc. and a Clinton conspiracy buff whose 1997 book, The Strange Death of Vince Foster: An Investigation, darkly posited that the 1993 suicide of the deputy White House counsel and longtime Clinton friend might have been a murder. Ruddy, as the journalist Michael Isikoff memorably described him, was “the Inspector Clouseau of the Foster case—a determined, if bumbling, former New York Post reporter who has virtually single-handedly spawned a cottage industry of conspiracy buffs dedicated to the proposition that a foul and monstrous cover-up surrounds the circumstances of Foster’s death.”

By 2006, Ruddy had built a successful right-wing publishing empire near his home in West Palm Beach, Fla., where prominent Republican politicians would come to seek his favor. There he befriended Trump, who extended an invitation that Ruddy accepted to join his Palm Beach club, Mar-a-Lago. Ruddy’s Newsmax supplied a steady stream of fawning testimony to Trump’s supposed political power (“The Trump Effect”) along with face-saving ego balm when the GOP establishment denied him the respect he desired (“Trump Declines Prime-Time GOP Convention Speech”—he wasn’t offered one). In a colorful burst of cross-promotional synergy, Ruddy even arranged for Newsmax to host a 2012 Republican presidential debate in Iowa that Trump himself was going to moderate. Alas, Trump backed out when only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreed to participate. The debate was canceled.

Trump was still feeling his way toward a political identity when Mitt Romney lost the 2012 presidential election. Through Newsmax, Trump delivered a blistering critique of why Romney had failed, one that now feels disorientingly out of character, because he attacked the former Massachusetts governor over his stance on immigration—but did so from the Left. “He had a crazy policy of self-deportation which was maniacal,” Trump complained to Newsmax. “It sounded as bad as it was, and he lost all of the Latino vote. He lost the Asian vote. He lost everybody who is inspired to come into this country.” Romney’s approach was too “mean-spirited,” Trump averred, and thus was always destined to fail.

One Trump adviser who wished to remain nameless suggested that Trump’s seeming moderation on immigration here was driven by business concerns rather than politics. Trump had bought the Doral Resort and Spa in Miami out of bankruptcy in 2012 for $150 million and was in the process of renovating the 800-acre golf resort. Aware that Miami is “an epicenter of immigrants” and that he would need zoning variances, the adviser said, Trump took special care not to offend them.

As he navigated the fever swamps of the Right, Trump quickly became attuned to the roiling grass-roots anger over illegal immigration. “It was intuitive by him to use immigration as a new wedge issue,” says Sam Nunberg, a former Trump adviser who was fired from the campaign in 2015 over racially charged Facebook posts. Recognizing that his base of support would never come from genteel, country-club Republicans, Trump felt free to abandon niceties and embrace the same mean-spiritedness for which he had just criticized Romney. “He digests this stuff,” says Nunberg. “He knew who his audience was going to be—it was not going to be people who want to have policy debates. It was going to be older people, people who work with their hands.”

The political fault line Trump stumbled across had lurked beneath the surface of Republican politics for a long time. Illegal immigration divided law-and-­order conservatives, who wanted to see lawbreaking immigrants deported, from business-minded conservatives, who preferred to maintain a cheap source of labor, held more ecumenical views, and worried about the risks of alienating Latino voters. Periodically these tensions flared up, as they had in 2007 when President George W. Bush, hailing the United States as “a nation of immigrants,” tried to pass an immigration reform bill that would have allowed 12 million undocumented immigrants to become U.S. citizens. His effort was soundly defeated by conservatives in his own party who attacked the “amnesty” Bush was offering to people who had broken the law.

As the Republican Party turned once again to immigration reform following Romney’s poor showing with Hispanic voters, these same tensions rose to a boil, even as leaders in both parties agreed it was time to get something done. Trump positioned himself squarely against the effort, encouraged by his growing fixation with what was then still an unorthodox political technology: Twitter. “That was our focus group,” says Nunberg. “Every time Trump tweeted against amnesty in 2013, 2014, he would get hundreds and hundreds of retweets.”

“Eighty percent of people [voting] in my primary get their news from Fox.”

For a brief time after Obama’s reelection, it appeared as if a moment of reconciliation might finally be at hand. From its earliest days, Obama’s first term had been marked by uninterrupted partisan fighting over everything from the $800 billion stimulus package to the new health-care law. Bitterly frustrated by that rocky experience, Obama had won a second term and, he imagined, a chance to finally pursue bipartisan legislation. Always prone to applying Spock-like logical rigor to his analysis of a Republican Party that rarely hewed to this standard, Obama expected to encounter a new, more productive attitude from his opponents across the aisle.

The early signs were propitious, and they all centered on immigration. Stunned by a loss few of them had anticipated, most prominent Republicans concluded that passing comprehensive immigration reform was an existential imperative for the party. In early 2013, the vehicle to do so took shape in what became known as the “Gang of Eight” bill, a bipartisan reform measure led by eight senators that would provide a path to citizenship for the now 11 million immigrants living illegally in the United States, while also enlarging guest-worker programs for low-skilled jobs in industries such as agriculture. In what seemed a positive omen, the Gang of Eight bill had the added designation of being a vehicle for the presidential ambitions of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, the telegenic young Cuban American then considered to be the GOP’s brightest rising star. With Rubio, the darling of Fox News, leading the charge, the bill appeared to have unstoppable momentum.

With the marquee conservative outlet Fox News squarely behind immigration reform and the Democratic Party united in support, the locus of opposition to the Gang of Eight bill emerged in the conservative underworld: Breitbart News, the Drudge Report, and a far-flung network of allied radio talk shows. To Bannon, who was now running Breitbart News following Andrew Breitbart’s death in 2012, killing the reform effort became a defining crusade. The website published a daily fusillade of alarmist fare about hordes of murderous illegal immigrants pouring across the southern border and the treasonous Republicans in Congress turning a blind eye to their menace.

Having produced the 2006 documentary Border War on the subject, Bannon knew how to maximize his viewpoint for dramatic effect. At his urging, Breitbart opened a Texas bureau and developed a network of sources that included Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents stationed on the U.S.-Mexico border, who provided on-the-ground details that made these stories more vivid. “Among those informed about immigration [the Gang of Eight bill] was shocking—a kick in the teeth to decent Americans,” said Jeff Sessions, then a staunchly anti-immigrant Republican senator from Alabama, who would later become Trump’s attorney general.

An abiding frustration of right-wing populists such as Sessions and Bannon was that their views had little representation in the mainstream media, or even in conservative alternatives like Fox News. Rupert Murdoch, the CEO of News Corp., which owned Fox, and Roger Ailes, the network’s president, were both strong advocates of immigration reform, and made sure the network reflected their preferences. “God bless Fox,” gushed South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican Gang of Eight member, soon after the bill was introduced. “Eighty percent of people [voting] in my primary get their news from Fox.”

Instead, Breitbart News stories fed the opposition, suffusing right-wing radio. “They have an incredible eye for an important story, particular ones that are important to conservatives and Republicans,” Sessions told Bloomberg Businessweek in 2015. “They’ve become extraordinarily influential. Radio talk-show hosts are reading Breitbart every day. You can feel it when they interview you.”

Trump felt it, too, and he responded almost immediately. “When I started putting him on conservative talk radio in 2013,” says Nunberg, “Mark Levin’s show and guys like that, they kept asking him about immigration. That opened his eyes.” The issue also dovetailed with Trump’s long-held view that the U.S. was being taken advantage of by hostile foreigners.

By the time Trump spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference on March 15, 2013, less than four months after decrying Romney’s “mean-­spirited” attacks on immigrants, he was a fully recognizable incarnation of the candidate who would storm the White House three years later. “We have to make America strong again and make America great again,” Trump told the CPAC crowd. “Because when it comes to immigration, you know that the 11 million illegals, if given the right to vote … every one of those 11 million people will be voting Democratic.” Republicans who supported immigration reform, Trump warned, were “on a suicide mission.”

Although it passed the Senate, the following summer the Gang of Eight bill died in the House, done in by conservative backlash. Breitbart News put the final nail in the coffin. Tipped off by border agents, the website first drew attention to the child migrant crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border. The vivid scenes of helpless U.S. officials and detention facilities overrun by waves of Mexican and Central American children were widely picked up by the national media, killing any chance of Congress passing immigration reform. The backlash also took down Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia. In June 2014, after Cantor was blindsided in the GOP primary by an unheralded economics professor named David Brat, Trump gave an interview to Breitbart News that delighted conservative populists by blaming unchecked immigration for the party leadership’s stunning loss.

Cantor’s defeat was “a great signal because it tells them people want to get our house in order,” Trump said in the interview. “If you look at what’s happening in Texas right now, or other places, people are just flowing into this country just like it’s an open-door policy. We’re supposed to provide health care and we’re supposed to provide education—we’re supposed to provide everything. … We take care of everybody else before we take care of our own people.”

Trump had transformed himself into a full-blown hard-right populist, a political persona he now projected like a cologne. He had made up his mind to run for president. “Donald told me on New Year’s Day 2013, when I called to wish him Happy New Year, that he’d just trademarked the phrase ‘Make America Great Again’ and was definitely going to run,” says Roger Stone, Trump’s longtime political adviser. Yet few people noticed or cared. He was still a punchline. In fact, Republicans were soon celebrating. The 2014 midterm elections brought sweeping gains at every level of government, handing the party control of the Senate. As they looked ahead to the presidential election, Republican leaders were giddy at the presumed strength of the emerging GOP field, a distinguished roster of senators and governors—and perhaps even the more talented sibling in a Bush dynasty that had already produced two presidents.

Trump was no longer “talking to everyone.” Now he was talking solely to the conservative grass roots and saying wildly polarizing things. It would not become clear until much later that Trump, the stridently anti-immigrant populist, was better able to address (and stoke) the fear and anger of Republican voters than anyone else in the vaunted GOP field.

Or rather, it wasn’t yet clear to the wider world. Inside Trump’s circle, the power of illegal immigration to manipulate popular sentiment was readily apparent, and his advisers brainstormed methods for keeping their attention-­addled boss on message. They needed a trick, a mnemonic device. In the summer of 2014, they found one that clicked. “Roger Stone and I came up with the idea of ‘the Wall,’ and we talked to Steve [Bannon] about it,” says Nunberg. “It was to make sure he talked about immigration.”

Initially, Trump seemed indifferent to the idea. But in January 2015, he tried it out at the Iowa Freedom Summit, a presidential cattle call put on by David Bossie’s group, Citizens United. “One of his pledges was, ‘I will build a wall,’ and the place just went nuts,” says Nunberg. Warming to the concept, Trump waited a beat and then added a flourish that brought down the house.

“Nobody,” he said, “builds like Trump.”

Worried the risk of fresh U.S. sanctions and falling oil prices will keep Russia’s ruble under pressure? Don’t fret, says the currency’s top forecaster.

The allure of one of the highest interest rates globally will eclipse the factors that drove the ruble to its worst quarter since 2015, according to Sebastien Barbe, head of emerging-market research and strategy at Credit Agricole CIB. Last quarter’s most-accurate ruble watcher sees the Russian currency recovering to trade at 57 per dollar by the end of the year.

“The risk of new sanctions has been priced in by the market so I don’t expect this to produce additional negativity,” Barbe said by phone. “A lot of people are still looking for some carry in emerging markets. Even with the central bank’s rate cuts, the rates in Russia remain very high."

Credit Agricole is siding with ruble bulls like Credit Suisse Group AG and Nomura International Plc as market participants remain split on whether the currency’s 4.5 percent, March-to-July drop will continue. Underpinning Credit Agricole’s forecast is a $54-per-barrel prediction for the price of oil by the end of the year as the OPEC supply-cut deal holds and global demand remains stable.

Carry Trade Defined, or Why Interest Rates Matter: QuickTake Q&A

“A lot depends on the oil prices--if oil prices don’t fall a lot, then there’s a strong case for the Russian carry trade,” Barbe said.

The ruble weakened for a fourth day, trading down 0.2 percent at 60.1275 against the dollar as of 11:49 a.m. in Moscow. Brent crude added 1.4 percent, trimming Wednesday’s 3.7 percent slide.

Investors borrowing where rates are low and using the funds to buy higher-yielding assets have made a 6.8 percent return from the ruble this year as the central bank signaled it will cut rates only gradually. Since September, policy makers have delivered a cumulative 100 basis points of cuts, compared with 4 percentage points in Brazil over the same period. Even if policy makers reduce the key rate by a further 75 basis points this year to 8.25 percent, the real yield would still be “very high,” Barbe said.

While Credit Agricole is positive on the ruble in the short-term, Russia will struggle to return the economy to the pace of expansion seen before commodity prices tumbled in 2014, Barbe said.

“Right now there’s a perception that Russia is coming back, exiting the recession, but once the period of normalization is over, the market will ask the question of whether Russia can go back to strong rates of growth like we saw 10 years ago,” Barbe said. “A lot of things suggest that it’ll be very difficult for Russia to grow by more than two percent every year."

Barclays Plc Chairman John McFarlane said he’s confident much of the trading, clearing and fund-management activity involving the euro will remain centered in London, countering dire predictions of a mass exodus of bankers from Britain after Brexit.

“The right thing for the European Union and for the U.K. is to retain a significant proportion” of euro-related business in London, McFarlane said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. Cross-border, mostly electronically executed activities like euro clearing are less likely to be forced to move than other bank businesses, he said.

“We’re pretty confident that quite a degree of wholesale activity, even clearing activity, et cetera, fund management, will remain in the U.K. and London in particular,” he said.

Euro-derivatives clearing has been a key battleground ever since Britons voted to leave the EU in June last year, with French and German leaders threatening to forcibly repatriate those operations. The comments from Barclays’s chairman, who also heads TheCityUK lobbying group, indicate the differing opinions on Brexit among Britain’s business elite. Xavier Rolet, chief executive officer of London Stock Exchange Group Plc, has warned as many as 232,000 jobs are at risk.

Scottish-born McFarlane, who turned around insurer Aviva Plc before taking over the chairmanship at Barclays, said the dispute over euro clearing was largely political, because there’s no economic rationale for moving the business out of the British capital.

“To my knowledge, nobody has asked for clearing to move from the business standpoint, because it’s actually working very efficiently the way it is,” McFarlane said. “I don’t think it will work, aside from anything else.”

Clearinghouses collect collateral and stand between traders to prevent a default from spiraling out of control. Their role has become far more entrenched since the 2008 financial crisis. The business has been concentrated in London because it is more efficient for banks to hold all their swaps in one place than it is to hold them at multiple clearinghouses. Banks can reduce their margin payments by using positions in one currency to offset their positions in another.

The Bank of England estimates a single basis-point cost increase that might result from splitting the clearing of interest-rate swaps could cost firms across the euro zone 22 billion euros ($24.9 billion) a year, according to a June 27 report.

The U.K. has found an unlikely ally in Germany’s top financial regulator, who said he wasn’t a “fan” of stripping London of euro clearing.

"I would warn against jumping too quickly on solutions that look interesting at first glance, but could end up triggering a lot of protectionist collateral damage," BaFin President Felix Hufeld said in Frankfurt May 9. "You have to be clear what consequences this can have.”

Transition Sought

Given the systemic importance to the continent, it is “not unreasonable” that EU authorities should be granted “some form of oversight” of euro-related activities within the U.K., McFarlane said.

“If the price is shared regulatory oversight, then it is a price worth accepting," said McFarlane at TheCityUK conference in London on Thursday. Fragmenting the “current superior offering in London will inevitably lead to higher costs and capital and is undesirable in practice, whatever the politics."

The world’s biggest clearinghouse may accept its potential fate post Brexit. An executive at LSE’s clearing unit has said EU oversight of its euro operations makes sense.

“A sea as big as the channel isn’t too big to make enhanced oversight work,” Daniel Maguire, group chief operating officer at LCH Clearnet, said on June 7.

In the interview McFarlane reiterated calls for a multi-year transition arrangement to avoid a “cliff-edge” Brexit that would damage both sides. It’s still desirable to end up with a free-trade agreement allowing some mutual access to each other’s markets, McFarlane added.

After the ruling Conservative Party lost its controlling majority in U.K. Parliamentary elections last month, politicians such as Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond are pushing for a softer version of Brexit.

“Of course the government has listened” to financial services, McFarlane said. “Well, we think so. But we don’t actually know at the moment what the stance is, because there is a lot of political uncertainty. We don’t think it could have gotten harder.”

TheCityUK is hosting its annual conference in London Thursday.

Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc cut its full-year sales forecast after a global cyberattack last month disrupted manufacturing and distribution, in the first detailed indication of the financial toll by a major company.

The maker of Air Wick fresheners and Dettol cleaners expects sales to rise about 2 percent on a like-for-like basis, Reckitt Benckiser said in a statement Thursday. Previously it forecast 3 percent growth.

“This is more than we were expecting,” RBC Capital Markets analyst James Edwardes Jones said in a note. The shares fell as much as 3.2 percent in early London trading.

An estimated loss of 1 percent of annual sales would equate to about 90 million pounds ($117 million). The news comes after the company failed to deliver quarterly sales growth for the first time in its history in April as setbacks in Air Wick and its Scholl foot-care brands weighed on results. Reckitt Benckiser is also wrestling with the after-effects of a scandal in South Korea over a toxic humidifier sanitizer the company used to sell.

The cyberattack caused widespread disruptions to shipping terminals, corporate information-technology networks and other vital infrastructure around the world. Reckitt Benckiser joined companies including FedEx Corp. and Danish shipping company A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S in falling victims late in June. Employees at snack giant Mondelez International Inc. worked with mobile phones and personal email after their computer system was infected.

Nivea skin-care maker Beiersdorf AG suffered “many millions” of euros worth of damage as a result, Stern magazine reported this week, citing an unidentified manager whose comments have not been confirmed by the company. Beiersdorf fell as much as 1 percent in Frankfurt.

The virus began spreading in Ukraine and demanded ransom money to unlock computer systems. Reckitt said it believes it has contained the problem and it’s working to resolve outstanding IT issues, though some factories are still not operating normally.

Health Care

Reckitt Benckiser’s health-care division, which includes brands such as Durex condoms and Nurofen painkillers, suffered the most damage from the attack, according to a person familiar with the situation. The company’s review of its food business, which could result in a sale, will not be affected, this person said.

Reckitt Benckiser also said that a new tax in India reduced orders from some customers in June. Second-quarter revenue fell 2 percent, the company estimated. It said it expects to recover some of the lost sales in the third quarter and systems of Mead Johnson, the infant-formula maker the company recently acquired, were unaffected.

“These impacts are exceptional and not a reflection on the underlying strength of the business,” Berenberg analyst Rosie Edwards said in a note.

As Qatar’s showdown with the Saudi-led alliance enters a second month, its currency peg is still intact -- though not everyone can use it.

Qatari banks are providing enough cash to meet domestic business needs at 3.64 riyals per dollar -- within the regulator’s preferred range -- while turning away investors financing trades deemed speculative, according to five people with knowledge of the matter. That’s forcing such transactions offshore, where lenders are trading the riyal at weaker rates, the people said, on condition of anonymity because they’re not authorized to speak publicly on the issue.

The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.

The divergence shows how the gas-rich Gulf nation is trying to limit the impact of the Saudi-led boycott on its economy and conserve its dollar reserves, even if it means allowing a parallel offshore exchange rate to emerge. While economists say the dollar peg isn’t under threat, Qatari banks have significant funding demands ahead of the 2022 soccer World Cup and rely on non-residents for almost a quarter of their deposits.

Officials at Qatar’s central bank didn’t respond to a request for comment. The regulator said in a July 3 statement that the riyal’s exchange rate was “absolutely stable against the U.S. dollar,” and that it “will guarantee all exchange transactions for customers inside and outside Qatar without delay.”

Qatar National Bank, the country’s biggest lender, said in an email that it and other local lenders are “determined to undermine speculative trading in the Qatari riyal.”

But that doesn’t relieve the pressure on the currency in the forwards market. Contracts that expire in 12 months jumped about 400 basis points since the spat began on June 5 to 600 as of 9:49 a.m. in Doha. That’s a record high on a closing basis.

‘Commercial Transaction’

“QNB ensures FX pricing for all counterparties at all times where a commercial transaction is the basis for the trade within the Qatar Central Bank guidelines,” the bank said.

The gap between the domestic and offshore rates widened last week during a public holiday in Qatar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, before the central bank returned to providing dollars to local lenders at the official price. The central bank typically buys and sells dollars to keep the exchange rate within a range of 3.6385 to 3.6415 riyals per dollar.

“The peg is not broken,” Farouk Soussa, the London-based chief economist for the Middle East at Citigroup Inc, said in an email, adding that the offshore rate reflects tighter liquidity in the interbank market used by exchanges without access to Qatar’s central bank.

“With a very open domestic banking system, any business that does not yet have access to a local bank account can always open one in order to receive the official rate,” he said.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed their diplomatic and transport links with Qatar, accusing the country of supporting extremist groups and cozying up to Iran. The isolation is hurting the small Gulf nation, which has repeatedly denied the charges, and has created a new source of tension in a region already convulsed by conflict.

The benchmark Qatar Exchange Index for stocks has dropped about 10 percent since the crisis began, and on Tuesday, Moody’s Investors Service cut its credit outlook to negative.

“It would only be fair to say that the peg has been broken if the Qatari central bank is no longer willing or able to offer dollars at the 3.64 exchange rate,” Jason Tuvey, an economist at Capital Economics in London, said by email. “So long as this remains the case, which we think it will, the offshore market will probably fade away over the coming weeks.”

Donald Trump stands with Theresa May at the West Wing of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 27, 2017.

The special relationship will get a reality check when U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May meets one-on-one with U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday for the first time since a disagreement over climate change and the London Bridge terror attack.

The meeting, at the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg, will be a far cry from the pair’s first encounter at the White House in January. Then, May was hoping to use her closeness to the new president to show how Britain could be a key player in the world after Brexit.

Now she is a diminished figure, weakened by the June 8 general election, and a state visit by Trump remains unscheduled amid threats of mass protests.

“We in the U.K. do not agree by any means with everything that Washington currently says,” U.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told BBC Radio 4. “It’s the U.K. that is actually helping, we think, to mitigate, to get some of those American attitudes and policies that are currently coming out of the White House into a better place.”

The two leaders will discuss North Korea’s latest missile test, with May supporting United Nations sanctions, according to a U.K. official who asked not to be named because the plans are private.

More difficult will be their discussion about climate change after Trump pulled out of the Paris accord, a move attacked by European leaders. May has already told the president that was a mistake, and will reiterate Britain’s support for the agreement, the official said.

No Hands

In January, May even held Trump’s hand as they walked through the White House as she sought to get as close as possible to the new president. This strategy has been unpopular at home and 1.8 million people signed a petition calling for Queen Elizabeth II’s invitation for a state visit, announced during May’s trip, to be withdrawn. Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow said the president wouldn’t be welcome to address Parliament.

The premier’s charm offensive hasn’t yielded much from Trump in return. Hours after May’s plane took off from Washington, he announced the first version of his ban on people from seven majority-Muslim countries traveling to the U.S., embarrassing the prime minister. May has many Muslim voters, and one of her lawmakers would have been affected by the ban.

Then last month she was put in a difficult position by the president’s comments about British terrorist incidents. In the wake of the London Bridge attack, Trump criticized London Mayor Sadiq Khan on Twitter, accusing him of being “pathetic.”

At the time May, under repeated questioning, said Khan was doing a good job and anyone who disagreed was “wrong,” but she refused to directly criticize the president.

This reluctance may have hurt her in the general election three days later. Opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said during the campaign that May’s attitude to Trump was one of “subservience.”

Johnson said there’s been “a lot of progress” changing the administration’s positions and he also had words of praise for a man who has rewritten the political playbook in the U.S.

Trump “raises people’s awareness of issues, he engages in a very direct way,” Johnson said. “He’s engaged people in politics in a way we haven’t seen for a very long time with his tweets and the rest of it.”

At Bloomberg Pursuits, we love to travel. And we always want to make sure we’re doing it right. So we’re talking to globe-trotters in all of our luxury fields—food, wine, fashion, cars, real estate—to learn about their high-end hacks, tips, and off-the-wall experiences. These are the Distinguished Travel Hackers.

Jessica Nabongo was born and raised in Detroit after her parents immigrated from Uganda. Since then, she has lived everywhere, from Benin to rural Japan, charting her travels in her blog, Catch Me If You Can.

Nabongo turned her passion into a business when she started Jet Black, a boutique travel company that focuses on encouraging tourism to Africa among the African diaspora. But she isn’t desk-bound, despite her clients’ demands; working remotely, so far she’s logged 75 countries and counting of the world’s 195.

Nabongo’s airline of choice? Delta. “I usually do 120,000 [miles] per year, but this year, as of last week, I’m already at 90,000, so I’m going to do closer to 250,000 [in 2017].”

Don’t trust the photos on a hotel’s website when you can do this instead.

I use the geotag feature on Instagram—it’s my new method of checking out hotels. You find a hotel that has four or five stars, and you’re looking at the pictures on the website thinking, This is amazing. But I want to see what [guests] are posting there. When I was looking for hotels in Zanzibar, for instance, many of [the geotagged photos] didn’t look like their pictures on their websites at all. People had geotagged them, and I could see it wasn’t a very nice beach.

You can always avoid checking your carry-on, even on a full flight.

On a recent trip I traveled between Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Djibouti, Qatar, and Bahrain with my handy-dandy Away bag. I love the way it rolls and charges my devices [with a built-in battery]. Depending on the region of the world you are in, [airlines] can be pretty strict about the weight of your carry-on bag, often asking to weigh it. Generally the maximum is 14 kilograms, or 30 pounds, which somehow for me is never enough. So when I approach the counter and they say I have to weigh my carry-on, and I know it’s too heavy, I say, “Actually, it’s camera equipment, so I can’t check it.” Airlines don’t want liability for electronic equipment. It works every time, even if they tell you to check it at the gate. And it is technically true, as I have a camera and a lens in there. It’s just the whole thing isn’t camera equipment.

How to fit two weeks’ worth of clothing in a carry-on.

The first thing I do before packing is write down a list of where I’m going, and I put in the climate as far out as I can tell [from weather reports]. I count up the number of days and count out my underwear to make sure I have enough. Then I lay out all my bottoms and my tops, then use Flight 001 spacepaks for them. They are absolutely the best thing on the market. I’ve tested them, trying to pack without them, and it doesn’t work. Using them, though, I can usually get two weeks’ worth of clothes to fit in a carry-on bag. I recommend the number 2, 3, and 4 models. And I use a long wallet from Flight 001’s T5 collection to keep my boarding passes and my passport together.

Nabongo says the best thing about Bali is that "every city is different. Ubud is all about relaxation and being one with nature. The energy is serene and calm, yet so very alive." Photographer: Elton Anderson

A two-point plan for scoring the best flight deals every time.

Every morning I read flight deals like they’re my New York Times: I check The Flight Deal, Secret Flying, and Airfare Spot. If there’s a place I haven’t been, I allow them to dictate where I travel next—like when I went to Bali, because I found a ticket for $450 from L.A. And Chase Sapphire Reserve is the best thing that’s ever happened to me; it blows the American Express Platinum card out of the water for anyone who calls himself a real traveler. It comes with a membership for Priority Pass, which is at over 1,000 lounges around the world. Sometimes, when I fly a small regional airline, it’s given me access to lounges in places like Kilimanjaro and Zanzibar. And the rewards system is insane. I have not paid for a plane ticket in four and a half months because of Chase. The annual fee is $450 per year, but you get a $300 travel credit every year, so if you charge a flight from New York to L.A? Boom! You get a $300 credit, so now the annual fee is really only $150.

"When in Kampala, be sure to stop at National Theatre in the city center," Nabongo says. "It's my favorite place in East Africa for shopping. Visit my aunt in stall 14!" Photographer: Sarah Waiswa

Where to shop in Africa.

I am obsessed with the National Theatre in Uganda [which also features local artists’ work], because your money goes so much further with the exchange rate of the Ugandan shilling to the dollar. If you’re going to Kenya, I highly recommend stopping in to Kampala on the way and going there: The craftsmanship is amazing, on everything from bags to serving utensils. I love walking around a city [in America] with one of the bags, which are practical and fashionable.

Embrace the rain—for the right reasons.

I always recommend traveling at the end of the rainy season. I’ve done this in East Africa, the South Pacific, and Southeast Asia. I just Google “rainy season” plus whatever country to find out. Most recently, on that trip to Bali, I went toward the end of the rainy season. The lodging is cheaper—I’d estimate around 30 percent cheaper, on average—and I love taking pictures without other people in them! I got lucky, as I spent two and a half weeks in Bali, and it rained the day I arrived but never again. And I always travel with this footwear: little hunter green ankle booties from J.Crew, which are easier to walk in [than knee-high Wellington boots], take up less room in your case, and are really cute. And I have a pair of bright yellow rubber Chuck Taylors, which are waterproof.

Take that, St. Barts or Ibiza. The best island you’ve never heard of? It’s in Africa.

Nabongo says Lamu Island is one of Kenya's best-kept secrets. "There is a lot of local tourism to the island, but most outside visitors travel to Mombasa and Diani. The food in Lamu is incredible, the people are super nice, and the sunset showboat rides can't be beat." Photographer: James Anthony

Lamu is a quaint, quiet island off the coast of Kenya, which all my Kenyan friends told me about. It’s a short flight from Malindi, where most tourists go, and like much of the East African coast, it’s largely Muslim. I went during Ramadan, so it was extra quiet, very calm and peaceful. We stayed at Forodhani House, which is really good for a family or a group of friends. But if you want more of a hotel, try Majlis. The architecture and culture of the island is a mash-up of Swahili and Arabic influences. Like Zanzibar, it’s a spice island, dating back to the old trade between the Arabian Peninsula and India. So the best part of a trip there is the food—the best samosas I’ve ever tasted, and I grew up in a home eating a ton of Indian food, with a Ugandan mother who makes samosas. I already told her, “Mommy, you’ve got to rethink your recipe.”

How to chop onions without crying, wherever you are in the world.

When I graduated from the London School of Economics and Political Science, I spent an extended stay in Benin City, working with a small Italian NGO. We were living about 250 kilometers from [the largest city] Cotonou, in one of the world’s poorest countries, so you can imagine what life was like. We lived with some nuns in a convent, because there was a cave nearby where people came for pilgrimage. The convent was the only place in that area with electricity and running water, but not hot water. One time, when I was cooking my own meal, I was struggling with chopping onions, and my eyes began to water. One sister, from Nigeria, handed me a matchstick and told me to put it between my teeth, flammable side out, and it would prevent my eyes from watering while cutting onions. To this day, I always put a match in my mouth when cutting onions, and it works like a charm!

U.S. Representative Steve Scalise has been readmitted to the intensive care unit of a Washington hospital because of concerns about infection, three weeks after he was wounded by a gunman who attacked GOP lawmakers as they held a baseball practice.

Scalise, the third-ranking U.S. House Republican, is listed in serious condition, according to a statement from MedStar Washington Hospital Center on Wednesday night. The hospital said it would provide an update on his status Thursday.

Scalise was among four people shot on June 14 by a gunman later identified as James Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Illinois. The other victims continue to recover from their wounds.

Hospital officials have said Scalise, 51, would need multiple operations and many weeks to recover after a single bullet tore through his pelvis, fracturing bones, injuring organs and causing severe bleeding. Scalise had been transferred from the intensive care unit on June 22 and listed in fair condition.

As majority whip, Scalise is the chief vote counter in the Republican conference and has served in the House since winning a special election in May 2008. After the shooting, President Donald Trump visited his bedside and later said “he’s a great fighter.”

The FBI said Hodgkinson, who died after a shootout with police, had with him a piece of paper listing six lawmakers. He appears to have acted alone, the FBI said.

Jeremy Corbyn inflicted an electoral blow on Theresa May last month by appealing to young voters with a promise to scrap university tuition fees if his opposition Labour Party won power. High fees and large maintenance loans mean students in England now graduate owing almost 51,000 pounds ($66,000) on average, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Most will still be paying off student loans into their 50s and three-quarters will never clear the debt, the IFS analysis found.

The U.K.’s biggest banks, asset managers and insurers placed flexible immigration rules among their top priorities for a Brexit deal, as the industry seeks to mitigate the potential impact of leaving the European Union, according to a lobby group.

Changes to Britain’s visa and immigration system to help financial firms hire foreign nationals, a deal on market access and other measures could help generate 43 billion pounds ($55.5 billion) of economic gains by 2025, according to a report by TheCityUK published on Thursday. While the plan helps regain some lost ground from Brexit, it still won’t bring as many benefits as remaining in the EU, it added.

“We need to make the argument to government of the need to continue to allow people from overseas to come and work in the sector,” former U.K. Treasury minister Mark Hoban, who led the publication of the report for TheCityUK, said in an interview. “It’s particularly important given the global nature of the sector that we have a global workforce.”

Prime Minister Theresa May is under pressure to focus on the needs of the economy rather than reclaiming sovereignty over immigration and law-making as Britain negotiates its divorce from the EU. Business leaders have complained about potentially losing access to international talent as her government seeks to curb the inflow of migrants to the tens of thousands annually.

“In the absence of a deliberate strategy to counter the effects of Brexit and other challenges, the industry is expected to stagnate,” Hoban’s team wrote in the report, produced with accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The study’s 35-point package of recommendations can help the finance industry “return to growth – albeit moderate – after a period of considerable adjustment,” it said.

May’s government should ensure continued movement for European citizens coming to Britain for work, including for some individuals without immediate employment prospects, according to the report.

Net migration to the U.K. fell by a quarter to 248,000 in 2016, driven by an increase in EU citizens leaving the country, while British rules around immigration have tightened, the report said. The cost to employers of sponsoring a five-year general visa has increased 250 percent between 2016 and 2017 and now totals 7,000 pounds, while the minimum salary threshold for workers has risen 44 percent since July 2015 to 30,000 pounds a year, according to the report.

The recommendations could help the finance industry contribute an additional 16 billion pounds to the U.K. economy by 2025, with about two thirds of the growth coming from outside London. The alternative scenario would deliver a loss in the U.K.’s international competitiveness as a financial center and slower growth, the report said.

Mass Exodus?

Some global banks with European headquarters in London are already poised to move parts of their operations elsewhere in the EU. There is a “threat of a tipping point in the ecosystem being reached at some stage in the future,” according to the report.

Finance firms could relocate en masse when the cost of having to hold additional capital in multiple locations becomes uneconomical, it added. The report argues for the U.K. to secure “mutual market access” for U.K. and EU finance companies following Brexit, while securing a transitional arrangement to avoid a so-called cliff edge at the end of the nation’s two-year negotiation period.

As aging riders hang up their leathers, Harley-Davidson and Honda pin their hopes on smaller, affordable bikes for a new generation.

For Fed Pacheco, it was a long journey from motocurious to motorcyclist.

There was a ride years ago in Texas on his uncle’s Suzuki Boulevard, not long after Pacheco had emigrated from Venezuela. A few years later, he decided to take a riding course and got his motorcycle license, though he still didn’t pull the trigger. But when Honda unveiled its new Rebel 500 in November, the 27-year-old finally went all in.

“I just started obsessing about it, to be honest,” he said. “The riding season was coming up and I thought ‘You know what? Maybe, it’s not that crazy.’” Pacheco traced one of the first Rebels on the market to a dealership in New Jersey, walked in and paid $6,800 on the spot. The bike was still in its shipping box.

With a starting price of $6,000, Honda’s Rebel 500 is aimed at younger, first-time riders.

Honda’s Rebel is the latest entry in a parade of new bikes designed for first-time riders; almost every company in the motorcycle industry has scrambled to make one. They are smaller, lighter, and more affordable than most everything else at a dealership and probably wouldn’t look out of place in the 1960s—back when motorcycling was about the ride, not necessarily the bike. They are also bait for millennials, meant to lure them into the easy-rider lifestyle. If all goes as planned, these little rigs will help companies like Harley-Davidson coast for another 50 years.

“They’re new motorcycles, but they’re also new thinking,” said Mark Hoyer, editor-in-chief of Cycle World magazine. “They’re selling this perception of lifestyle ... it’s a cultural movement; a rebranding of the whole motorcycle industry.”

It’s also the manufacturing equivalent of a mid-life crisis. Motorcycle sales in the U.S. peaked in 2006 at 716,268 and promptly started to skid. When the recession hit, the market went down hard. Bike sales fell by 41 percent in 2009 and another 14 percent the following year, according to the Motorcycle Industry Council. That’s not surprising considering the economy at the time: A motorcycle is a picture of discretionary spending, and they can be tricky to finance even in a healthy credit market. Even now, with the stock market on a historic bull run and after the U.S. auto industry posted its best year on record, traffic in motorcycle stores has stayed slow. In 2016, U.S. customers rolled off with 371,403 new bikes, roughly half as many as a decade ago.

And then there’s the generational time-bomb. In 2003, only about one-quarter of U.S. motorcycle riders were 50 or older. By 2014, it was close to half. The market has been cruising on a demographic that may only be able to buy one more bike.

Suddenly, bike-makers desperately need new riders and millennials, apparently, are the best hope. Not only are there more of them than GenXers, but they have a longer expected lifetime value, which is corporate way of saying they’re a further away from needing a hip replacement.

Harley-Davidson’s Street 500 quickly turned its riding academies into a sales opportunity.

Around 2010, bikemakers made a major strategic shift: Sturgis was out; Coachella was in. They needed something cool to show on the wealthy, quasi-hipster music scene, something far from the fat-fendered, chrome-soaked hogs buzzing around South Dakota. “Everybody is trying to do the same thing,” said Lee Edmunds, manager of Honda’s motorcycle marketing. “They’re all realizing they need to have more people come in at an entry-level stage.”

Harley-Davidson led the charge, perhaps because it dominates the U.S. market for large motorcycles and has the most to lose. Between 2006 and 2010, the number of big-engined Harleys registered in the U.S. plummeted by almost half. The company has hosted riding academies for first-timers since 2000, but it quickly ordered its engineers to design a true starter bike.

Unveiled in 2013, the Street 500 resembles a conventional Harley in the way an Ivy League quarterback resembles an NFL lineman. The engine, just shy of 500cc, won’t turn any heads in Daytona Beach or wake anyone up in suburbia. The seat sits relatively low to the ground and the whole package can be had for just under $7,000. The Street 500 quickly became the standard kit in Harley’s riding schools, which churn out 65,000 new riders a year.

“There was a requirement to be more relevant to urban environments,” said Anoop Prakash, the company’s director of U.S. marketing. “Prior to the Street, we certainly believed and knew many riders would start in another brand.”

At about the same time, Kawasaki launched its Ninja 300, a subdued version of its famous sport bike. It has the same angry wasp styling, albeit with a much smaller powerplant and pricetag—$5,000; anti-lock brakes could be had for $300 more.

A post shared by Scrambler Ducati (@scramblerducati) on Mar 2, 2017 at 5:56am PST

In 2014, Ducati joined the first-timer fray with its Scrambler, resurrecting a sub-brand that it last made in 1974. The contemporary version is essentially an 803cc engine wrapped in six different trims, from a no-frills “Classic” to a stripped down café racer. The engineering lends itself to tinkering and Ducati encourages buyers to customize their Scramblers with add-on elements.

“We call it a naked bike,” said Jason Chinnock, chief executive of Ducati North America. “It was trying to bring something to market that had a nod to the nostalgia, but also the simpler way motorcycling was approached in the 1970s.”

About a year later, BMW pulled the cover off its G 310 R, a tidy, 350-pound version of its famous touring bikes. Anti-lock brakes are standard, and with a sticker price of $4,750, it’s less expensive than adding “smoke white” merino leather to one of BMW's 7-series sedans.

The base version of BMW’s G 310 R costs $4,750 and includes anti-lock brakes for a safer ride.

Finally, Honda rolled out the Rebel that Pacheco fell so hard for. Pacheco is cofounder of a Manhattan marketing shop called Hungry Studio—it’s his job to know what a brand represents and what a product projects. In the end, the Honda felt more right to him than the Harley-Davidson that he learned to ride on. “It didn’t feel cheesy to me at all; it felt tasteful,” he explained. “And I could definitely tell they were advertising to people like me.”

Make no mistake, the economics on these bikes isn’t great. Profit margins are far fatter on something like a Honda Gold Wing F6B, an 844-pound locomotive that starts at $20,500. But that swollen kit doesn’t hold much street cred where Pacheco parks in Manhattan, in part because the folks buying those big cruisers are quickly transitioning from the roadhouse to the golf course.

The problem, however, with this sudden industry pivot to younger customers is that it may be coming too late. For years, it was too easy to just keep building bigger, more powerful bikes. “They got more complicated, more expensive and more intimidating,” said Edmunds at Honda. “For a long time, all the manufacturers could do that, because that baby boomer market was so huge.”

Chinnock, at Ducati, calls it “the horsepower game.”

The new breed of small bikes, meanwhile, has quickly become the most promising part of the business. Between 2011 and 2016, sales of motorcycles with engines smaller than 600cc increased by 11.8 percent, while bigger, more powerful bikes managed only a 7.4 percent gain.

In its first full year its Scrambler was on the market, Ducati sold 15,000 of them—28 percent of its total business. “These riders were not looking at Scrambler as an entry to the world of Ducati; they looked at it as a whole new thing,” Chinnock said. “It’s kind of one of those business mistakes you’re OK with.”

Harley-Davidson, meanwhile, has a new marketing tagline: Nine bikes for under $12,000. Prakash, the marketing chief, breaks it down to $6 a day. Skip the latte; buy a bike.

Oil pared losses after an industry group was said to report big declines in U.S. crude and gasoline stockpiles that have remained stubbornly high during this summer driving season.

The day’s news reflected the ongoing debate over whether prices are more reflective of actions undertaken in U.S. shale fields, or by an OPEC-led push to balance the market with production cuts elsewhere.

Futures fell as much as 5.4 percent on Wednesday, as Russia was said to oppose any proposal to deepen the output cuts. Prices recovered somewhat on American Petroleum Institute estimates said to show crude inventories fell by 5.8 million barrels last week and gasoline supplies dropped by 5.7 million. West Texas Intermediate for August delivery settled $1.94 lower.

“Any opposition to deeper output cuts supports the doubters of the effectiveness of the supply deal, fueling bearish oil-market sentiment,” said Norbert Ruecker, head of commodities research at Julius Baer Group Ltd. in Zurich.

While crude prices surged last week, futures are down about 15 percent for the year amid concerns that rising global supply will offset the output cuts from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners. Libya and Nigeria, which are exempt from the agreement, accounted for half of the group’s production boost last month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

West Texas Intermediate for August delivery settled $1.94 lower at $45.13 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures reached $45.65 at 4:57 p.m. after API data was released. Tuesday’s transactions were booked Wednesday for settlement purposes because of the U.S. Independence Day holiday. Prices gained almost 11 percent in the eight days through Monday.

Brent for September settlement closed at $47.79 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, down $1.82. The global benchmark touched $48.32 after the API report.

Gasoline Demand

"Everybody’s been talking about the death of gasoline demand, but we didn’t see that this weekend," Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, said after the API report. "Maybe it’s not as weak as we thought."

As for the pact between OPEC, Russia and their allies to reduce output by a combined 1.8 million barrels a day through March 2018, deepening the cuts would suggest that they are nervous that the pact isn’t doing enough to support prices, one of the Russian officials said.

Russia "pretty much threw cold water" on rumors of additional cuts, said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York. "Now we’ll see if this rally was based on loose expectations that there could’ve been some agreement or additional cuts, or if it was a rally on short-covering."

A short-covering rally is when short-sellers take advantage of low prices to go on a buying spree to return securities they borrowed and sold when prices were higher.

The owner of the Newgate Mall plans to pour $500,000 into overhauling the outdated food court in a bid to lure restaurateurs and hungry shoppers. Rent payments from eateries are never going to recoup the renovation costs, but for landlord Time Equities Inc., that’s not the point. The point is survival.

The food hall is part of an effort to breathe new life into the entire 718,000-square-foot (67,000-square-meter) center and increase foot traffic, according to Ami Ziff, director of national retail at New York-based Time Equities. The company, which bought Newgate in Ogden, Utah, from GGP Inc. for $69.5 million last year, is one of many landlords wagering that elaborate makeovers will keep them competitive as they reinvent their properties in the age of Amazon.

Costs are escalating as mall owners work to keep their real estate up to date and fill the void left by failing stores. The companies are turning to everything from restaurants and bars to mini-golf courses and rock-climbing gyms to draw in customers who appear more interested in being entertained during a trip to the mall than they are in buying clothes and electronics. The new tenants will pay higher rents than struggling chains such as Macy’s and Sears, and hopefully attract more traffic for retailers at the property, according to Haendel St. Juste, an analyst at Mizuho Securities USA LLC.

“The math is pretty obvious, pretty compelling, but there are risks,” St. Juste said in an interview. “This hasn’t been done before on a broad scale.”

Costly Updates

It’s more costly to build and maintain large, customized spaces that require extensive updates such as commercial kitchens, according to St. Juste. Landlords’ capital expenditures -- including repairs, remodeling and leasing costs -- are rising relative to the income being generated by retail properties.

As the retail business evolves, such capital expenditures will become more crucial in assessing property values, according to Green Street Advisors LLC, a research firm that covers real estate investment trusts. Many investors aren’t adequately accounting for the rising costs of maintaining a mall, Green Street said in its annual outlook in January. The real question is whether this is a temporary blip, or a new normal, according to Cedrik Lachance, director of U.S. REIT research at the Newport Beach, California-based firm.

More than a dozen retailers have gone bankrupt this year as the shift toward online shopping accelerates. Even healthy companies are shuttering hundreds of locations. As many as 13,000 stores are forecast to close next year, compared with 4,000 in 2016, according to brokerage Cushman & Wakefield Inc.

Many landlords have been proactive in reclaiming space from weaker tenants to fill with more profitable ones. Chicago-based GGP, the No. 2 U.S. mall owner, has bought back 115 department stores over the last six years and redeveloped them, Chief Executive Officer Sandeep Mathrani said last month during the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust’s annual conference in New York. The new tenant roster at those malls includes Best Buy and Nordstrom stores, restaurant-arcade chain Dave & Buster’s and health club Life Time Fitness, he said.

“We’ve actually made a very, very big statement by saying that over the next five years, we hope to recapture another 100 department stores,” Mathrani said.

Gaping Holes

Department stores, the heart of suburban malls for decades, have been particularly hard hit by changing consumer tastes, leaving gaping holes in their wake. The departure of a center’s anchor tenant can easily spur an overhaul of the entire property.

“If Sears shuts down, you need to reinvent that part of the mall,” said Green Street’s Lachance. “Typically, when you reinvent one part of the mall, you redevelop the whole mall.”

So far, jettisoning and replacing undesirable tenants has been a successful formula for many landlords, but there is still a lot of work to be done, according to Jeffrey Langbaum, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. Some companies won’t have the cash to keep up amid the relentless pace of store closures, he said.

“For the most part, these companies have been able to redevelop and backfill space,” Langbaum said. “That’s great, but the big wave is still coming.”

The vacancy rate for malls crept up to 8.1 percent in the second quarter from 7.9 percent in the previous three months due to Macy’s store closures, according to data provider Reis Inc. Closures of J.C. Penney Co. stores have been delayed and aren’t showing up in the data yet, according to Reis.

GGP, Simon

It can be difficult to calculate capital expenditures for malls because of poor landlord disclosures, Green Street analysts said in the January report. It’s a challenge to distinguish between deferred maintenance -- for example, fixing a roof -- and projects that will actually generate additional revenue at a property, the analysts wrote.

Giants such as GGP and Simon Property Group Inc., the largest mall owner in the U.S., are better positioned to absorb the increased costs than their peers that own less-desirable real estate, according to Green Street. The two companies have some of the most profitable malls in the country, and their high sales volumes make it easier to recover expenses.

For Simon, redevelopment costs as a percentage of net operating income climbed from 3.5 percent in 2010 to 16.6 percent in 2015, before dropping to 7.6 percent last year, according to data Mizuho pulled from the company’s filings. A representative for Indianapolis-based Simon declined to comment. However, on a conference call in April, CEO David Simon responded to a question from an analyst about the potential for rising capital expenditures.

“We spent a lot of capital in the portfolio to upgrade the look and feel. We’re going to continue to do that,” Simon said. “I think the returns will be there, and I don’t think the dynamics of today’s current environment have changed that.”

Modern Makeovers

For Ziff of Time Equities, which buys outdated malls and renovates them, it doesn’t matter how you categorize the expenses of making over a center for the modern era, or if there is a linear path to a return on a particular project. Whether it’s installing a fireplace in a new food hall, or buying artwork for the common area, the aim is to drive higher traffic and tenant sales, he said. Ultimately, it’s all cash going out the door.

“It’s not always an exact science quantifying the return on investment when it comes to mall renovations and redevelopments,” Ziff said. “Every property has its own story.”

Deutsche Bank AG is preparing to move large parts of the trading and investment-banking assets it currently books in London to its hometown of Frankfurt in response to Britain’s exit from the European Union, people familiar with the matter said.

Germany’s largest lender would move most of the business reported in London to a so-called booking center in Frankfurt under the plan, said the people, who requested anonymity because the discussions aren’t public. The jobs of several hundred traders and as many as 20,000 client accounts will likely be shifted as well, said another person. The strategy, which is still being finalized and would be reviewed if the Brexit scenario changes, will probably be implemented over the next 18 months, the people said.

A year after Britain’s decision to exit the EU, the world’s biggest banks are eyeing potential alternative locations for some of their London operations. The turmoil triggered by Brexit has dovetailed with Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Officer John Cryan’s desire to move the troubled lender closer to its base in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial hub.

“It’s another milestone in what we call the Brexodus,” said Gildas Surry, who helps oversee about 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) at Axiom Alternative Investments in London, including Deutsche Bank bonds and shares. “Every single continental European bank is working on plans to repatriate their trading and plumbing in their home cities. ”

U.K. Subsidiary

Deutsche Bank in March unveiled a new strategy that involves focusing the investment bank on corporate clients and highlighting the firm’s German roots, including appointing two German deputies to Cryan. One of them, Marcus Schenck, assumed his role as co-head of the investment bank on July 1.

That division, which was recently formed by merging the Global Markets and Corporate & Investment Bank units, had 16,628 front-office staff at the end of the first quarter, down from 17,100 at the end of 2015, according to an overview of the new segment structure published by Deutsche Bank Thursday.

If Britain were to lose passporting rights granted to EU members, Deutsche Bank would probably have to turn its London branch, where it books most of its U.K. investment-banking business, into a subsidiary that would require capital, according to one person. The transition to a Frankfurt booking hub would be gradual and will require investments in infrastructure, technology and office space, another person said.

Christian Streckert, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank, declined to comment.

Frankfurt has emerged as a winner of the Brexit vote, with Standard Chartered Plc, Nomura Holdings Inc., Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. and Daiwa Securities Group Inc. picking the city as their EU hub in recent weeks. Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are weighing a similar move.

The German city is home to the European Central Bank and BaFin, seen as one of the few EU regulators outside of London capable of handling the banks’ complicated derivatives businesses. Berlin has also drawn interest from some banks and financial technology firms due to its access to cultural offerings and startup scene.

Deutsche Bank’s plans for the Frankfurt booking center are part of a two-year Brexit project that sees various team managers working to move accounts, processes, booking structures and legal entities to Frankfurt, one of the people said.

The German lender employs thousands of bankers and traders across London, one of the world’s biggest financial hubs. The lender reported about 5 billion euros of U.K. revenue in 2016, almost one-fifth of its total and more than any other location apart from Germany and the U.S., an annual report shows.

“They can move as many trading and investment assets to Frankfurt as they want,” said Bill Blain, a strategist at Mint Partners in London. “But the gravitational center of the European financial universe will remain in London for some time -- whatever Brexit we get.”

The bank recently unveiled a plan for new U.K. headquarters scheduled to be ready by 2023. At the time, the move was hailed as “a commitment to the City” by the other co-head of the investment bank, Garth Ritchie, who’s also the bank’s U.K. CEO. Deutsche Bank has suggested that as many as 4,000 jobs in the U.K. could be under consideration in a Brexit shake-up, depending on how the negotiations with the EU turn out. The lender had 8,575 employees in Britain at the end of 2016, according to the annual report.

“Frankfurt is a much cheaper location and this is a great excuse to move a part of the business and all of its support functions to Frankfurt,” said Christopher Wheeler, a bank analyst with Atlantic Equities.

A divided Federal Reserve policy committee couldn’t reach an agreement in June on the timing of when to begin shrinking its massive balance sheet, according to minutes of the meeting.

“Several preferred to announce a start to the process within a couple of months,” the minutes of the June 13-14 meeting released on Wednesday in Washington showed. “Some others emphasized that deferring the decision until later in the year would permit additional time to assess the outlook for economic activity and inflation.”

U.S. central bankers in June raised the benchmark lending rate for a second time this year to a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent, while describing monetary policy as “accommodative” in their statement. They reiterated their support for continued gradual rate increases, according to the minutes.

Fed officials updated their balance-sheet policy in the gathering, laying out a path of gradual reductions with caps. The central bank wants to start winding down the $4.5 trillion bond portfolio without roiling longer-term interest rates, while gradually raising the policy rate. The minutes indicated that the committee wants to begin the balance-sheet process this year.

The Fed said in June it would runoff maturing principal payments on Treasuries initially at $6 billion per month, increasing by $6 billion every three months over 12 months, until it reaches $30 billion.

For agency and mortgage-backed securities debt, the cap starts at $4 billion, and rises by $4 billion every three months until it hits a $20 billion a month.

Key Metrics

The minutes showed Fed officials split on other key metrics for monetary policy.

The minutes said “several participants endorsed a policy approach” where the labor market would undershoot their estimate of full employment “for a sustained period.” Meanwhile, several other participants “expressed concern that a substantial and sustained unemployment undershooting might make the economy more likely to experience financial instability or could lead to a sharp rise in inflation.”

Financial conditions were also debated at the meeting, with some participants arguing that “increased risk tolerance” among investors could be lifting asset prices. A few others expressed concern that “subdued market volatility” could lead to financial stability risks.

“A few participants also judged that the case for a policy rate increase at this meeting was strengthened by the easing, by some measures, in overall financial conditions,” according to the minutes.

Yellen said last month that asset valuations look “somewhat rich” using traditional metrics like price-earnings ratios.

Political Gridlock

Washington political gridlock is also starting to creep into the outlook of the Fed’s business contacts, the minutes showed. “Contacts at some large firms indicated that they had curtailed their capital spending, in part because of uncertainty about changes in fiscal and other government policies,” the minutes showed.

Yellen begins her semi-annual testimony to Congress on July 12 before the House Financial Services Committee.

Inflation has remained almost continuously below the central bank’s 2 percent target for more than five years. The minutes said “most participants viewed the recent softness” in inflation indicators “as largely reflecting idiosyncratic factors.” They added those trends weren’t likely to persist in the medium term.

On the other side of the Fed’s dual mandate, the jobless rate declined to a 16-year low in May of 4.3 percent, beneath most Fed officials’ estimate of the maximum use of labor resources. The U.S. Labor Department releases the June employment report Friday.

What do watches, oil, uranium and screws all have in common? At one time or another they were argued to be critical to America’s national defense.



For the past five-and-a-half decades, industrial groups and government officials have occasionally used Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act to determine whether imports of those materials and others represent a threat to national security. Under that law, known as the nuclear option on trade, the Commerce Department conducts a report and submits recommendations to the president, who decides whether to impose trade barriers if it's determined that foreign sales are undermining domestic security or the defense industry.



The Trump administration is now using Section 232 to probe whether cheap imports of steel and aluminum are harming American metal producers and eroding their ability to innovate as well as retain workers, thus endangering national security. The action fits Trump’s tough talk on trade and one of his key campaign planks to bring back manufacturing jobs from overseas.



Commerce started its investigations in April and has 270 days to finish, though the steel report was originally expected as early as last month. As we wait for the studies to drop, let’s look back at history for a guide into previous investigations.

Department of Commerce

Throughout the 1970s, a period when the U.S. and other western countries were experiencing an energy crisis, the government investigated American oil imports four times under Section 232. It probed oil again in the late 1980s and in the 1990s, both before and after the first Iraq War. Before the Berlin Wall fell in the late 1980s, when fear of a nuclear war with the Soviet Union loomed, the U.S. used Section 232 to look into uranium.



In all but a few instances, the reports come back saying that imports of the material had no adverse effect on national security. When they did constitute a threat, very little action was actually taken.

“Trade protection is an extremely blunt instrument and you can do a lot of collateral damage with it,” said Rodney Ludema, an economics professor at Georgetown University.

Department of Commerce

Businesses have been the biggest users of Section 232. Corporations and trade groups have requested more than half of the investigations, including those that delved into plastic injection molding, circuit breakers and machine tools, according to data from Commerce. One group, the Anti-Friction Bearing Manufacturers Association, asked for three investigations, and General Electric Co. requested two. Ronald Reagan presided over the most probes of any president -- seven.



A variety of industries have sought protection for an even wider variety of products over the years, including everything from photograph shutters to wooden boats. Then-President Lyndon B. Johnson requested an investigation into watches, movements and parts in 1965 to see if the Pentagon was dependent on imports of such timing devices for use in weapons and other military supplies.

Department of Commerce

The last 232 investigation was conducted in 2001 under President George W. Bush at the request of two Democratic congressmen. That probe looked into iron ore and semi-finished steel and ended with Bush taking no action against imports.

In fact, presidents haven’t acted on 232 investigations in decades, even though some found imports constituted threats to national security. The reason, according to Georgetown’s Ludema, is because the World Trade Organization has given countries the ability to contest U.S. action, potentially opening the door to trade wars.

Department of Commerce

“I don’t understand what we get by trying these 1970s tools in 2017,” said Caroline Freund, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “Hard to imagine how this will be productive.”

Efforts under way in nearly two dozen states on privacy rules

Soon after President Donald Trump took office with a pledge to cut regulations, Republicans in Congress killed an Obama-era rule restricting how broadband companies may use customer data such as web browsing histories.

But the rule may be finding new life in the states.

Lawmakers in almost two dozen state capitols are considering ways to bolster consumer privacy protections rolled back with Trump’s signature in April. The proposals being debated from New York to California would limit how AT&T Inc., Verizon Communications Inc. and Comcast Corp. use subscribers’ data.

The privacy rule is just one example of states resisting policy changes wrought under the Trump administration. After Trump withdrew from the Paris climate accord, the governors of New York, California and Washington formed a coalition to fight global warming. California has also balked at Trump’s review of fuel-efficiency standards for automobiles and said it would fight any move to weaken them. And 35 states are pressing for the right to enforce laws guaranteeing internet service speeds live up to advertisements.

“If the federal government lags, the states have to lead. And that’s what we’re doing,” said Tim Kennedy, a Democratic New York state senator. Kennedy introduced a bill to prohibit internet service providers from selling customer web searches, social media histories and other personal information to third parties -- the crux of the nixed federal regulation.

‘Hurts the Little Guy’

In New York, Kennedy’s bill in the Republican-dominated Senate didn’t advance before the legislative session ended. He says he’ll be back.

“We’re going to continue to drive this agenda forward, so consumers know their privacy is at risk,” Kennedy said in an interview. He blamed “a misguided decision, once again out of Washington, that helps the large multibillion-dollar corporations but hurts the little guy.”

The federal rule, which passed the Federal Communications Commission in October, hadn’t yet taken effect. It said internet providers such as AT&T, Verizon and Comcast would need consumers’ permission before using or selling customer data for marketing or other purposes.

The restrictions covered broadband providers that are regulated by the FCC because they provide a telecommunications service. The rule didn’t cover web-based companies that track consumers, such as Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, whose privacy practices are regulated by a different U.S. agency -- the Federal Trade Commission.

Repeal Passes

Get the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day. Get our newsletter daily.

Critics including the broadband providers said the differing treatment wasn’t fair. The problem stems from the FCC’s earlier decision to classify broadband as a telecommunications service it could regulate, said Representative Marsha Blackburn, the Tennessee Republican who sponsored the privacy-rule nullification Trump signed. By setting that classification, the FCC removed broadband providers from regulation by the FTC. The measure to repeal the privacy rule passed with only Republican votes.

“What it did was to preserve the status quo, and allow us back to the posture where we had been” with “one regulator and one set of rules for the entire ecosystem,” said Blackburn, who leads the House subcommittee on communications.

Congress for years has failed to pass consumer privacy rules and “of course the states are looking at what they need to do,” she said.

Broadband companies don’t want to deal with a patchwork of different state laws.

“The internet doesn’t stop at state lines, which is why it’s preferable to have federal privacy rules that provide consistent protections for consumers,” Amy Schatz, a spokeswoman for US Telecom, a Washington-based trade group with members including AT&T and Verizon, said in an email. Both companies opposed the FCC’s rule, and each in statements welcomed its rejection by Congress.

21 States

Blackburn on May 18 introduced a bill to bring broadband providers and web companies under regulation by the same agency, the trade commission, and require consumer assent to use data. Democrats haven’t signed on, and the measure’s been criticized by advertisers and the Internet Association, a trade group with members including Google and Facebook, companies known for tracking users.

At least 21 states have filed measures responding to the federal repeal, according to a tally kept by the National Conference of State Legislatures, which conducts policy research for state governments.

In California, lawmakers have yet to consider a measure introduced by Assemblymember Ed Chau, a Democrat, to require permission by subscribers before a broadband company uses personal information.

“We believe that we should treasure our personal information," Chau said in an interview. Constituents “generally are worried that their information is being used. They want to have a say in how their personal private information is used."

‘Set the Pace’

“We want to set the pace,” Chau said. “And we hope to be the leader when it comes to privacy protections."

A law passed in California would apply only to companies operating in the state, but it could have an indirect impact elsewhere, said Chris Conley, a policy attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California.

"If we can get a strong model that is workable, then it’s something that can be adopted elsewhere,” Conley said in an interview. “We would still prefer that the federal government be the one driving this. But they’re not.”

Industry’s not thrilled.

“These state proposals are generally at odds with the realities of today’s internet” and are based on “zero evidence” of harm to consumers, said Brian Dietz, a spokesman for NCTA - The Internet & Television Association, a Washington-based trade group with members including largest U.S. cable provider Comcast and Charter Communications Inc. The measures “completely fail to respond to consumers’ desire for workable privacy standards that apply consistently to all parties collecting data online,” Dietz said in an email.

Wondering why three Federal Reserve officials were moved last week to make public pronouncements about rising asset prices? Evidently, it’s because of the potential for a “buildup of risk to financial stability.”

At least, that’s one way to read minutes to the June 13-14 meeting, where a few participants expressed concern about “subdued market volatility” and higher valuations. While far from an obsession -- others said rising stocks simply reflect more risk tolerance -- concern about markets is taking a bit more shape of late among policy makers.

For a Fed that has spent half a decade fretting about mistakes that might lay stocks and bonds low, commentary is coming faster now about the danger of pushing them too high. As always, central bankers walk a fine line keeping stimulus flowing to the economy without blowing bubbles in assets.

“We’re seeing this buildup of discussion about asset valuations -- it’s starting to make sense what’s going on,” Stewart Warther, an equity and derivatives strategist at BNP Paribas, said by phone. “There’s an increased focus on preserving financial stability through restraining excess in markets and jawboning and balance sheet reduction are the methods they’re looking at.”

By most measures, markets are calm and prices elevated. The CBOE Volatility Index averaged 10.5 in June, roughly half its historical average, while the S&P 500 touched a record on June 19 that represented a 19 percent annualized gain since it bottomed in March 2009.

It remains hard to get investors to care about any of this for an extended period. The S&P 500 was up 0.2 percent to within about 25 points from a record as of 2:54 p.m. in New York, trading at a P/E of 21.5. The Nasdaq 100 was up 1 percent, its multiple of 25.5 about 30 percent higher than its bull market average.

Fed officials have periodically cautioned investors about elevated prices over the last three years. Never has the impact lasted more than a day or two.

In May 2015, Yellen said stock valuations are “quite high” and could spur financial instability. The S&P 500 finished that week higher and rose the next two. In a report on monetary policy delivered to Congress in July 2014,officials said prices for smaller biotechnology and social media stocks were stretched. Equities also climbed that week.

“We have not yet reached the point that the FOMC could be viewed as an ‘enemy of the market,”’ Michael Shaoul, chairman and CEO at Marketfield Asset Management LLC in new York, wrote in a note to clients. “But stronger equity and credit markets are likely to encourage a faster path for rate hikes in the months ahead.”

The Federal Reserve’s consensus about when to shrink its balance sheet and how to approach policy strategy in a time of low inflation is starting to fragment.

Fed officials continued to view gradual interest-rate increases as appropriate while starting the process of unwinding their $4.5 trillion balance sheet this year, minutes from their June 13-14 meeting released in Washington on Wednesday showed. But their debate highlighted divisions over the timing of roll-off and unease at recent weak readings on inflation.

“They don’t understand why inflation is so low while they are nearing full employment,” said Julia Coronado, president of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC in New York.

Chair Janet Yellen is trying to manage a deft exit from unprecedented policy stimulus without roiling bond markets or slowing growth. She is also keeping an eye on inflation as labor-market slack diminishes in what could prove her final year at the helm of the U.S. central bank. Yellen’s current term expires on Feb. 3 and President Donald Trump has not yet indicated if he’d renominate her, or pick someone else.

U.S. unemployment stood at 4.3 percent in May, a 16-year low and well under the 4.6 percent that officials estimate representing maximum use of labor resources. For some, such low levels of labor market slack support their forecast that inflation will stabilize around the Fed’s 2 percent target.

So far, it hasn’t. The annual change on the Fed’s preferred gauge of price pressures was 1.4 percent in May and the index has been almost continuously below their target more than for five years. The minutes noted that “most participants viewed the recent softness” in inflation indicators “as largely reflecting idiosyncratic factors.”

Fed officials’ baseline outlook is that recent weakness in inflation “is transitory, but they have to formulate a plan if it isn’t,” Coronado said.

That plan, according to one wing of the committee, would be to ease back on policy normalization and wait for prices to rise.

The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter.

“A few participants who supported an increase in the target range at the present meeting indicated that they were less comfortable with the degree of additional policy tightening through the end of 2018,” the minutes said. “These participants expressed concern that such a path of increases in the policy rate, while gradual, might prove inconsistent with a sustained return of inflation to 2 percent.”

The minutes also showed a split on policy strategy, with about half the committee now supporting a run-it-hot scenario for the labor market.

“Several participants endorsed a policy approach” where the labor market would undershoot their estimate of full employment “for a sustained period.”

Meanwhile, several other participants “expressed concern that a substantial and sustained unemployment undershooting might make the economy more likely to experience financial instability or could lead to a sharp rise in inflation.”

Investors slightly increased bets on another rate hike this year following the release of the June minutes to roughly two-in-three, according to pricing in federal funds futures contracts, after the key takeaways left policy on track for now.

September versus December

“We continue to expect another rate hike in September followed by the announcement of the balance sheet run-off in December,” Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Bank AG in New York, wrote in a note to clients. “The main risk to this outlook is the that the Fed changes the sequencing of these moves.”

The policy committee was divided over when to start a gradual tapering off of its balance sheet, leading to no decision timing, minutes from the June meeting showed:

“Several preferred to announce a start to the process within a couple of months,” the minutes said. “Some others emphasized that deferring the decision until later in the year would permit additional time to assess the outlook for economic activity and inflation.” The minutes reasserted their intention to begin the process “this year provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated.”

"It sounds like there is genuine disagreement over whether sooner or later is better," said Guy Lebas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.

U.S. strategic crude stockpiles have dropped to the lowest level in more than 12 years as the shale boom reduces the nation’s need for an emergency buffer against shortages.

Inventories declined by about 13 million barrels over 17 consecutive weeks as the Energy Department delivered supplies it sold in recent months. That brought stocks down to 682 million as of June 30. In two sales held in January and February, the agency sold almost 17 million barrels of crude from its salt caverns in Texas and Louisiana to companies including Chinese state-owned PetroChina Co. Ltd.

The SPR sales have less impact than in the past because the U.S. doesn’t need that much in storage, said Vikas Dwivedi, senior analyst at Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. "You only need 60 days of your net import of crude and products in the emergency stockpiles."

Crude oil and refined product net imports stood at 4.23 million barrels a day for the week ended June 23, down from a record high of 14.4 million in November 2005. "Given the fact that we don’t net import that much any more, we only really need 300 million barrels," of SPR crude, Dwivedi said in a phone interview from Houston.

The U.S. set up the reserve in the aftermath of an oil embargo in 1973-1974, when several Middle East states cut off oil supplies to the U.S. Construction of the first surface facilities began in June 1977.

These drawdowns won’t end any time soon. The Trump administration has plans to sell another 270 million barrels of crude from the SPR over the next decade to help reduce the country’s debts. This is over and above the 190 million-barrel sale planned for 2018-2025.

"As soon as Trump got elected, we knew they were not going to be able to finance their plans for tax cuts," said Dwivedi. "So anything that looks like a piggy bank will get broken."

Storm Buffer

The reserve has acted as a buffer against natural disasters along the U.S. Gulf Coast, particularly hurricanes. In September 2005, President George W. Bush authorized the emergency sale of 30 million barrels of crude from the SPR after Hurricane Katrina swept through the Gulf of Mexico, causing massive damage to oil production facilities. Three years later, Hurricanes Gustav and Ike disrupted crude supply to several refineries along the Gulf Coast, prompting the release of 5.39 million barrels of SPR crude. These on-loan barrels were repaid in 2009.

The country’s emergency needs can now be covered with domestic crude supply, which is about 80 percent higher than a decade ago, thanks to developments in horizontal drilling and fracking that boosted production from areas that had been too expensive to tap. Domestic output reached 9.35 million barrels a day last month, the highest since August 2015, and is forecast to increase to above 10 million a day early next year.

The growth in U.S. production has been spread out all over the country, and not concentrated in areas like the Gulf of Mexico, where fields are prone to weather hazards, Dwivedi said. "We won’t knock off producing shale wells because of a storm."

For leaders as well as friends, spouses and colleagues, grace is a precious characteristic. Whatever one thinks of Donald Trump’s policy choices, our nation has never had a president more lacking in grace.

Whether or not Abraham Lincoln was the greatest American president, he was certainly its most gracious. Here’s the close of his brief Second Inaugural, delivered toward the end of the Civil War, when the nation was a house divided:

With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.

On the eve of victory, Lincoln avoided triumphalism or crowing. Instead he rejected malice and called for charity. He backed his firmness with both humility (“as God gives us to see the right”) and tenderness (“to care for him who shall have borne the battle”).

Ronald Reagan was usually a model of grace, with a strong preference for gentle humor and a touch of indirection. Asked at 73 if he was too old to be president, Reagan responded: "I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience."

At critical moments, Reagan chose understatement and humility, which are part and parcel of grace. A former Democrat, he liked to say, “I didn't leave the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party left me.” In his final speech at a Republican convention, in 1988, he began, “[B]eing only human, there's a part of me that would like to take credit for what we've achieved. But tonight, before we do anything else, let us remember that tribute really belongs to the 245 million citizens who make up the greatest -- and the first -- three words in our Constitution: ‘We the People.’”

In any competitive activity, gracious losers are easy to identify: They give credit to their opponent and never make excuses or blame referees. Because vanquished opponents (and their supporters) often feel horrible, it’s even more important to be a gracious winner, showing respect and admiration after victory, and emphasizing that things could have gone the other way.

The philosopher Avishai Margalit explores the idea of “a decent society,” which avoids one thing above all: humiliating people. Gracious leaders are unfailingly decent. They make people feel large rather than small. In conflicts, they challenge people’s opinions and actions, rather than their identities or their deepest commitments. They enable people to save face. They acknowledge their own errors. They never go for the jugular.

Grace breeds reciprocity. If a friend, a colleague or a spouse is gracious to you, you feel like a creep if you don’t respond in kind. That’s one reason that Reagan was such an effective debater: He disarmed his opponents. Reagan’s grace also helped him to work with committed political adversaries, most notably House Speaker Tip O’Neill.

Gracelessness shows bad character, but it is also an obstacle to success and often a recipe for failure. Humiliating people is a terrific way to reduce the likelihood of cooperation. Graceless leaders produce graceless followers and graceless opponents. Gracelessness is stupid, because those who lack grace inflame their adversaries -- and turn potential friends into enemies.

Actually it’s worse than that. We already have disturbing evidence that the election of President Trump has produced an increase in xenophobia, stemming from an erosion of social norms that counteract public expression of dislike or hatred of foreigners. It is not unreasonable to speculate that insofar as the president uses violent images or language against members of the press, or against political opponents, he will end up fueling actual violence.

Gracelessness is an absence of grace, but the English language lacks a word for the opposite of grace. One candidate is “ugliness”; another is “cruelty.” Every human heart is drawn, on occasion, to what is ugly and cruel, and even rejoices in them. Prominent Democrats are fully capable of displaying both. Of course, politics is a dirty business, and, as both Lincoln and Reagan knew, you sometimes have to hit back.

But in modern history, no White House has ever been more graceless. Put political differences to one side. That’s a betrayal of our nation’s heritage, and an insult to our deepest traditions.

With the ouster of Travis Kalanick, its founder and chief executive, Uber has vowed to mend an array of broken and frayed relationships. It can start with cities. It can focus on the sharing of some basic information. Its competitors, including Lyft, can join in this project, too.

App-based ride services have changed the urban world, often for the good. San Francisco already has some 45,000 Uber and Lyft drivers cruising the city's busiest areas. In New York City, as of last fall, ride-service companies carried 15 million passengers a month -- a tripling of ridership in a year and a half.

And yet many city, county and regional planners have precious few ways to measure the effects of this transportation revolution. They simply do not know the number of cars out there, the mileage they log, where they're driving people, and how much people are paying for the ride.

There are a few reasons for this. The companies consider their data private and proprietary. Cities and counties have not always had the foresight to ask for it. And now state legislatures, heavily lobbied by the ride-service companies, are beginning to usurp cities' authority.

Last month, for example, Texas enacted a law that puts regulation of ride-service companies into state hands -- voiding an Austin ordinance that had required the companies to report their pickups and drop-offs by ZIP code. (Austin had also demanded that drivers be fingerprinted, which led Uber and Lyft to flee the city until the state stepped in.)

California, Florida, Michigan and Massachusetts have likewise preempted city regulations. California's law demands some data from the companies for enforcement purposes but doesn't share any with cities or the public.

City and county governments need to understand how people are using ride-service companies so that they can see where changes are needed in transit services and in traffic engineering on local streets. Uber and Lyft ridership patterns might well suggest where express bus services are needed or train services should be improved. And cities should be able to demand the data they need, as many do from traditional taxi companies.

Clear thinking from leading voices in business, economics, politics, foreign affairs, culture, and more. Share the View

The agreements that cities are able to forge with ride-service companies today will become even more important with the advent of self-driving cars, which are expected to be deployed largely by the ride-service business and which will present vastly more complicated legal and ethical challenges than the human-based ride-sharing business. The hope is that agreements fleshed out now will create a strong template for the relationship between cities and the self-driving industry that's just around the corner.

Yes, cities are asking businesses to fork over precious data. That's not an inconsiderable concern. But this data need not identify individual customers. And remember, these are private enterprises that do their business exclusively in and on public, shared spaces: streets and roadways.

Two and a half years ago, before sexual harassment started backfiring against Silicon Valley venture capitalists, a woman named Trae Vassallo testified in a gender discrimination case that had been brought against the storied firm of Kleiner Perkins Caulfield and Byers.

The plaintiff in the trial, Ellen Pao, a former Kleiner partner, had had an affair with another Kleiner partner, Ajit Nazre; one of her claims was that he had retaliated against her after it ended. Vasallo, who left Kleiner in 2011, had also found herself on the receiving end of Nazre's sexual advances during her time at the firm, according to her testimony.

In 2009, she told the court, she had agreed to have drinks with him, believing they were going to discuss work; instead he "started touching me with his leg under the table." Another time, during a business trip, he showed up at her hotel room door in a bathrobe. She had to close the door in his face.

When Vassallo complained to Ray Lane, the former Oracle president who was probably the best-known Kleiner partner aside from John Doerr, he told her she should feel "flattered." Eventually she wrote a letter to a number of key partners, including Doerr, which prompted an investigation.

By the time Pao filed her lawsuit, Nazre had left the firm, though it is unclear whether the investigation was the reason why. His alleged behavior did not become public knowledge, and in May 2012, he joined another venture capital firm, Wellington Partners. He's still there.

Compare the consequences to Nazre for his alleged bad behavior -- basically, not much -- to the more recent exposes of sexual harassment by venture capitalists. It began two weeks ago when Reed Albergotti at The Information published a story about Justin Caldbeck of Binary Capital, a firm he had co-founded with a buddy. Caldbeck had a reputation for hitting on female founders, and Albergotti spoke to three of them, on the record, each of whom described an incident of sexual harassment involving Caldbeck.

Caldbeck responded with an apologia, declaring, "I am deeply ashamed of my lack of self-awareness." Within days, Dan Primack of Axios, who had also been chasing the story, was reporting that Caldbeck had left the firm, that a new partner who had been expected to join Binary had changed his mind, that several female founders had demanded that Binary "terminate their board relationship," and that a former employee was suing the firm for sexual harassment. Also, other women emerged with stories about Caldbeck's penchant for sexual harassment at his previous venture firms. By the end of the week, Binary Capital had become so toxic the firm appeared to have no choice but to wind down.

Days after the Justin Caldbeck story broke, Katie Benner at the New York Times published a story about sexual harassment in "the tech start-up ecosystem." Her story also named names, including that of Dave McClure, the high-profile founder of 500 Startups, a tech incubator. One woman showed Benner an email she'd received from McClure after she had spoken to him about a job. "I was getting confused about whether to hire you or hit on you," it read in part.

Like Caldbeck, McClure responded with an apologia -- his was entitled "I'm a Creep, I'm Sorry" -- but it didn't help. Despite being one of the bigger names in the start-up world, McClure was soon gone from 500 Startups, even as a second woman came forward with a detailed account of being propositioned and forcibly kissed. A female executive at 500 Startups resigned in disgust.

As Benner noted in the Times, sexual harassment in Silicon Valley is "pervasive and ingrained," and the allegations against Caldbeck and McClure have a tip-of-the-iceberg feel.

The critical component here is that after years of accepting sexual harassment as a fact of life -- not to mention discrimination in pay and access to capital and board seats and so on -- "women in Silicon Valley have just had it," Patty McCord, the former head of human resources at Netflix told me.

When Susan Fowler, the former Uber engineer, wrote her famous blog post in February laying out the rampant sexism at the company -- sexual harassment very much included -- she unleashed something. Her detailed, impossible-to-refute post was the trigger that led to the resignation of Uber's founder and chief executive, Travis Kalanick -- and showed, maybe for the first time in Silicon Valley, that publicly exposing sexual harassment could bring results.

The women who spoke to Albergotti and Primack and Benner no longer seemed to fear retaliation, which had long held back female executives and founders in Silicon Valley. Men still had most of the power and money, but something had changed -- you could see it, for instance, in Caldbeck's apology, in which he actually thanked the women who had spoken to The Information "for providing me with a sobering look into my own character and behavior that I can no longer ignore."

McClure's apology also had its share of self-abnegation; he called his actions "offenses" and "my personal failures" and "wrong." Although there have been a handful men in Silicon Valley defending the admitted harassers, the overwhelming sentiment there is that they know this behavior is wrong.

In the wake of the recent revelations, the venture capitalists and philanthropists Mitch Kapor and Freada Kapor Klein called on the tech community to "pioneer safe, effective, confidential complaint mechanisms to surface issues early." Reid Hoffman took to LinkedIn, the company he founded, to pen an angry post about this "entirely immoral and outrageous behavior." He called on the venture community to sign a "decency pledge."

All well and good, I suppose. But while there will always be sexual predators -- that's true in any industry -- I think the sheer pervasiveness of sexual harassment in Silicon Valley may soon be a thing of the past. In most other industries, sexual harassment can cost you your job. Now, finally, thanks to the women who have started to speak up, it's happening to venture capitalists.

Clear thinking from leading voices in business, economics, politics, foreign affairs, culture, and more. Share the View

It's not a complaint mechanism or decency pledge that will end sexual harassment in the Valley. When venture capitalists lose their jobs because they've done things they know are wrong, when their reputations are shredded, when their firms are suddenly in jeopardy of closing -- when they can no longer continue to flourish as easily as Ajit Nazre appears to have done a half-dozen years ago -- that's what will solve the problem.

All that's needed now is a few more shoes to drop.

Volvo's announcement that it intends to starts phasing out purely gasoline- and diesel-powered cars starting in 2019 in favor of electrified models appears strategically timed to coincide with the start of production of Tesla's Model 3, which should be hitting the streets by the end of this month. It's scary news for Tesla: The market for electric cars is largely government-driven, and Chinese-owned Volvo is taking advantage of especially generous government support.

Volvo's model cycle is about seven years. This means it'll keep making purely gasoline- and diesel-powered cars for some time past 2019, but the new models will be, at the very least, hybrids; all of them will have electric engines. "This is about the customer," the company's press release quoted Volvo chief executive Hakan Samuelsson as saying. "People increasingly demand electric cars."

That, however, is not quite true. Most electric and hybrid vehicles are sold in countries where government incentives are the strongest. There aren't many countries where fully electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids amounted to more than 1 percent of new cars sold in 2016, and in most of them, government stimulus -- of both the stick and the carrot variety -- is strong. As soon as the stimulus drops off, so do electric car sales. That happened in Denmark last year, where an attempt to phase out tax breaks resulted in a 71 percent drop in battery-powered vehicle sales and a 49 percent reduction in hybrid sales in 2016, according to the International Energy Agency. It happened in the Netherlands, where tax breaks on hybrids (but not on battery-powered cars) were cut and sales plummeted by 50 percent.

"Electric car market mechanisms are still largely driven by policy support," the International Energy Agency has concluded.

Volvo's unique advantage is that its two home markets -- Sweden and China -- are among the countries with the most generous government incentives, even though both have cut them slightly in recent months.

Sweden -- where 6 percent of all cars sold last year were electrified, the third biggest share in the world after Norway and the Netherlands -- offers a rebate of up to $4,500 with the purchase of fully electric vehicles and about half that much for plug-in hybrids. The latter are often bought by corporations because they're incentivized to do it by the government. In China, the central government subsidizes the purchase of electric cars by a maximum of $6,300, and provincial governments are allowed to add up to half as much to the subsidy. It's also easier to register an electric car than a traditional one in large Chinese cities. These incentives will stay in place in China at least until 2020.

In the U.S., meanwhile, the federal government offers tax credits of between $2,500 and $7,500 per electric car (and states can add to that), but they will be phased out for each manufacturer as soon as it sells a total of 200,000 cars -- something that should happen to Tesla quite soon if everything goes to plan with the Model 3.

Tesla sells cars in China, but isn't a major player. In 2016, it supplied just 7,548 of the 257,000 battery-powered vehicles sold in that country. The reason is that the Chinese government taxes imported cars at 25 percent. In the European Union, which includes Sweden, the tariff on car imports is 10 percent. A U.S. manufacturer faces an instant disadvantage, especially with a mass-market car, compared with a firm that makes vehicles in the world's biggest and third-biggest markets, China and the European Union. The import duties ruin the effect of electric car incentives.

Clear thinking from leading voices in business, economics, politics, foreign affairs, culture, and more. Share the View

Because suppliers capture a bigger share of the profit from electric vehicles than from traditional cars, large volumes are necessary for production to make economic sense for companies even when each individual car is sold at a profit (something that BMW says is true of its electric models, but Tesla can't say of its pre-Model 3 range). Automakers that produce electric cars in China and Europe are more likely to achieve large volumes than Tesla, with its U.S.-based production. In January through April 2017, 126,000 plug-in vehicles (hybrid and battery-powered) were sold in China and Europe, compared with 41,000 in the U.S.

No wonder Tesla is talking to the Shanghai provincial government to set up a factory. It will, however, take it longer than Volvo, the German automakers -- Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler -- or General Motors, which are already building cars in China and investing in electric vehicle production there.

Besides, these companies, unlike Tesla, aren't hung up on making battery-powered vehicles only. Volvo doesn't intend to drop gasoline and diesel engines for all new models -- it will merely supplement them with electric motors. That way, consumers for whom battery-powered vehicles aren't practical because of shorter range and longer charging times can get more choice.

Now that the established manufacturers are playing in the electric vehicle space, their greater versatility, geographic reach and financial resources make the world a dangerous place for Tesla. Soon, it'll be tested by the kind of competition to which "legacy" carmakers have long been accustomed, and it will be attacked from commanding positions.

The world's biggest mining companies have more or less recovered from the commodity boom and bust of the past decade. At the same time, they've been left with an existential crisis: What minerals are going to drive their growth in the decades to come?

Aluminum was white-hot in 2007 when Rio Tinto Group paid $38 billion for Alcan Inc., but it's since been sunk by a wave of Chinese oversupply. Coal and iron ore helped drive the Bloomberg Commodity Index to its most recent peak in 2011, but have fallen on harder times due to fears of climate-related demand weakness and a plateau in steel production. Even copper faces surpluses through to 2020, according to Bloomberg Intelligence's supply model, which would tend to weigh on prices.

Metal Flotation Cobalt prices have doubled this year Source: Metal Bulletin, Bloomberg

Thank goodness, then, for Saint Elon Musk. Demand for battery materials to feed the nascent electric-vehicle and electricity-storage industries has made a group of hitherto obscure minerals -- principally cobalt, lithium and graphite -- the next big thing in the mining industry.

Two Chinese groups spent $3.8 billion over the past year buying Freeport McMoRan Inc. and Lundin Mining Corp. out of Tenke Fungurume, a Congolese mine with some of the world's richest cobalt deposits. Glencore Plc, the largest cobalt producer, plans to double output by 2018. Rio Tinto has called out a lithium deposit discovered in Serbia as a potential top-three source of the element, and there have been numerous reports of bids for Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile SA, or SQM, one of the current largest producers. Shares in Graphite India Ltd., an electrodes manufacturer, have more than doubled this year; those of graphite developer Syrah Resources Ltd. rose 50 percent in the first half of 2016.

Graphite India shares, YTD +152.5%

With Volvo this week becoming the latest automaker to get on the EV train, could these minerals be the salvation of the resources industry?

Probably not.

To see why, it's worth looking at where the money is made in the global commodities trade:

Most resources companies concentrate on producing either basic materials (where demand is vast and prices low) or precious metals, where prices are stratospheric and output microscopic. Between those two extremes, there's a no-man's land of minor metals and other minerals which are somewhat costly, but not consumed in great volumes -- and that's exactly where cobalt, lithium and graphite are to be found.

A cautionary tale for this group of commodities played out in a Delaware bankruptcy court last month, where a judge approved the sale of Molycorp Minerals LLC's Mountain Pass mine to a group of creditors for $20.5 million plus liabilities.

Molycorp, the only U.S. producer of rare earths metals, briefly had a market capitalization above $6 billion in 2011, at a time when fears ran hot that China could control that market and choke off supply of materials used in critical applications such as missile-guidance systems. When Beijing unwound the export curbs that drove the surge in prices, the market was flooded and a budding rare-earths industry was snuffed out.

Rise and Fall Shanghai prices for rare earth oxides went through the roof in 2011. They've yet to recover Source: Shanghai SteelHome E-Commerce, Bloomberg

Why can't these materials get off the ground?

Substitution is part of it. The ideal commodities exist in a Goldilocks zone: Hot enough to generate some good margin, but not so hot that consumers switch to alternative materials. Were it not for the rise of consumer electronics, the copper business would have been in trouble when plumbers started using cheaper PVC in domestic pipework.

The threat of technological change is broader even than that. Humans have been using copper and tin since the Bronze Age kicked off more than 5,000 years ago and iron has been widespread for three millennia or so. By contrast, lithium-ion battery technology only dates back to 1991, and the specific mix of elements used in their electrodes varies widely.

While lithium, cobalt and graphite have some unique chemical properties, there's no guarantee that will last. Cells based on magnesium or sodium could see lithium-ion technology go the way of the nickel-iron cells that Thomas Edison hoped would power a previous generation of electric cars.

Beyond that is an issue of scale. Even after the recent crash in prices, the first rank of global mining companies all generate upward of $10 billion a year in revenue. Were BHP Billiton Ltd. to add the 2016 output of the global lithium industry at SQM's 14 percent net income margin, it would move its own profits by only a percentage point or so. And that sort of situation would never happen: As the U.S. House of Representatives demonstrated when it passed a law in 2010 to deal with Chinese dominance in rare earths, governments tend to get jumpy if one company dominates more than about a third of the supply of any raw material.

Back to Basics The winners from the rise of electric vehicles are likely to be the traditional industrial metals Source: Bloomberg Intelligence; Gadfly calculations

That's the best explanation for why miners are sticking for the most part with the same suite of commodities they've been digging up for the past few decades. Even if electric-vehicle sales surged to 41 million in 2040 from the about 800,000 expected in 2018, the biggest winners in volume and price terms would probably be boring old exchange-traded aluminum, copper and nickel, according to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eily Ong.

The primary industrial metals are dominant for long-standing reasons -- and even Musk isn't likely to change that.

The Chinese bike-sharing company Ofo Inc. just secured another $700 million, outraising Beijing Mobike Technology Co., which added $600 million to its coffers last month.

Except it isn't bike sharing, is it? As I have shouted in this newsroom more than once, these startups are in the business of bike rental. Why do they keep insisting they're part of the sharing economy?

Ofo's fleet by year-end 20 million bikes

If you don't know the difference, look up the term inventory risk.

For Ofo, that means owning 6.5 million bikes in 150 cities from San Francisco to Cambridge, England, with a target of 20 million bikes by the end of the year, funded by a total of $1.35 billion in cash. Mobike said last month that it has 5 million bikes in 100 cities from Manchester, England to Fukuoka, Japan.

Piling On Ofo's most recent funding round takes its cash-raising past $1.3 billion, most of that coming within the past year Source: Crunchbase

I suspect that Ofo, Mobike and their brethren insist on using the "sharing" moniker because they want to be just like Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc.

And who wouldn't want to be a heptaconta-unicorn? (That's a $70 billion valuation. In the startup world we're allowed to invent terms.)

Powerful Friends Mobike has also been busy with the pitch decks, landing Tencent and Foxconn among investors Source: Crunchbase

One thing bike-rental companies have in common with the car- and bed-share players is that they remove the middleman. The dockless business model means you just walk up to a bike and scan a QR code with your phone, while with Uber and Airbnb you use an app.

You haven't really removed the middlemen, though -- you've just outsourced them to the cloud. The startups themselves are the middlemen's programming overlords.

At least Didi Chuxing, Uber and Airbnb are trying to expand beyond their initial business models. Airbnb is adding experiences so that dreadlocked Quinn can help you surf and sleep under Santa Monica's stars. Uber wants to expand beyond car-to-passenger matchmaking and move into driverless cars (or they will, when they find a management team).

Bike startups haven't yet found a new future. Some of them are tapping into advertising, which is more a short-term survival tactic to leverage the inventory they own than a long-term plan.

Perhaps their next phase is to offer you the chance to sleep under a bridge in Shanghai. Or better yet: driverless bikes.

China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd.'s painful 4 percent tumble on Wednesday is a crude reminder of the dangers of trading on reform hopes.

The catalyst for the stock's biggest drop in more than two months was a harsh, two-step downgrade from Morgan Stanley to the equivalent of a "sell" rating. The U.S. bank is betting that the smallest of China's three main mobile operators won't be able to disclose fresh developments on its plan to increase the role of private investors by the time it reports quarterly results on Aug. 14. As a result, investors will shift their focus back to earnings, which are likely to disappoint, Morgan Stanley says.

Unicom had rallied 25 percent this year before Wednesday's setback, while China Mobile Ltd. was little changed and China Telecom Corp. rose less than 3 percent. Buoyed by the impending $10 billion IPO of China Tower Corp., Unicom features among the top 30 percent of globally crowded stock trades identified by quantitative analysts at Bernstein Research.

End of a Love Affair? Unicom has rallied in 2017 on the pending China Tower IPO Source: Bloomberg

It's not hard to see that Unicom has the largest upside if China Tower, set up to hold the wireless infrastructure assets of the phone-company trio, does manage to go public by year-end. It has the smallest market cap among the three major carriers but its stake in the tower company is equal to China Telecom's.

Cashing Out Unicom will be the biggest beneficiary of the China Tower IPO Source: Bloomberg

Still, Unicom investors would be wise not to get too enamored of the IPO, since it's unclear whether China Tower can achieve a decent valuation. While it's China's monopoly tower asset operator, the company hardly has monopoly power. Its customers, after all, are also its owners.

An additional drawback is the limited potential for growth. China is already littered with telecom towers. Any additional expansion is likely to happen in the sparsely populated rural areas, where China Mobile dominates. Just as Sprint Corp. and T-Mobile US Inc. won't go after the rural strongholds of AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., the much smaller Unicom and Telecom won't challenge the market leader in these regions.

So how much revenue growth is there really for China Tower? There's been talk in the market that the company may be tempted to invest in other infrastructure assets, such as recharging stations for electric cars, but investors aren't keen.

For now, Bernstein analyst Chris Lane estimates that China Tower may be valued at 273 billion yuan ($40 billion), well below the 500 billion yuan that might be expected if the business achieved the same enterprise value to Ebitda multiple as India's Bharti Infratel Ltd. That implies the stake would be worth only HK$2.50 per share to Unicom.

Bernstein estimate of China Tower's valuation 273 billion yuan

China Unicom has a second rabbit in its hat. Last October, it said it would be a pilot for China's "state-owned enterprise mixed-ownership reform," prompting wild speculation that internet giants from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent Holdings Ltd. would invest in the operator. As Gadfly has argued, extra investment could help Unicom go head-to-head with China Mobile in the race for spectrum, bandwidth and coverage, while the expertise of the internet companies could also help it develop innovative services.

However, Morgan Stanley is highly skeptical of the mixed-reform agenda. Contrary to market expectations, cable operator China Broadcasting Network is unlikely to become a strategic partner, denying Unicom access to spectrum that could help it narrow the gap with China Mobile as 5G approaches. Meanwhile, on the earnings front, Unicom is clearly underperforming China Telecom.

The day of reckoning may be coming soon for Unicom.

Yum China Holdings Inc.'s belly isn't full yet.

Shares in the operator of the KFC and Pizza Hut restaurant chains in China fell 5 percent in after-hours trading in New York on Wednesday after second-quarter revenue narrowly missed forecasts. Investors counting on Yum China as a bellwether to judge China's consumer growth story shouldn't be too alarmed, though. You can place this response right in the overreaction basket for now.

Part of the sudden share drop can be explained by profit-taking: Shares in Yum China are up more than 50 percent since splitting off from its parent company last November.

But it's also likely that investors freaked out after bidding up expectations in recent months well past realistic targets.

Other metrics, including earnings per share and sales growth at established restaurants (typically the most closely watched figure in the industry), handily beat already lofty forecasts.

Investors sitting down to feast on Yum China should pace themselves. Sure, there will be fits and starts, but the long-term growth story is there.

Unlike in the U.S., where there's little demand to open additional locations in an overly saturated restaurant market, China remains underpenetrated. That's especially true for lower-tier cities, as my colleague Shuli Ren wrote earlier this week. Yum China opened 90 new restaurants and remodeled another 197 in the last quarter, with plenty more locations to come.

It's also being smart and fast about rolling out digital payments, delivery, and loyalty programs -- three of the most important growth drivers in today's competitive restaurant industry. Its recently acquired controlling stake in Daojia, an online food delivery platform, will help accelerate efforts on that front.

Rising wages and commodity costs are certainly a headwind. And it was disappointing that Yum China's greatest laggard, Pizza Hut, posted flat sales this quarter compared to a year ago, especially since comparable-store sales at the chain rose 2 percent last quarter from the year before. But I'm willing to give the company the benefit of the doubt, as it works out all the kinks necessary to turn around the pizza chain and get input costs chainwide under control.

It makes sense for Yum China investors to want a mid-meal palate cleanser. But they're going to want to come back to the table for further courses.

As the U.S. economy enters its ninth year of expansion this month, many Americans feel the recovery has been incomplete -- and the numbers back them up.

Five states -- Arizona, Connecticut, Mississippi, Nevada and Wyoming -- still haven’t regained their levels of gross domestic product from before the financial crisis, more than five years after the country as a whole hit that milestone. Eight states are below prerecession levels of employment. And 15 have home prices that have yet to rebound fully.

While each of the states has individual obstacles, they illustrate how growth has lagged outside of the nation’s largest cities in New York, California and Florida. And though President Donald Trump won some of the states last November after highlighting sectors and regions that have lagged for years -- including, for example, coal mining in West Virginia and manufacturing jobs in the Midwest -- the pain hasn’t been limited to Republican territory.

“The hallmark of the recovery is that it is being driven by the nation’s largest metro areas,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. “Metro areas have attracted millennials and boomer empty-nesters and are globally oriented, benefiting from global capital inflows. Rural economies that are dependent on commodity-based activities have suffered.”

Wyoming’s Dependence

Wyoming -- which has the second-smallest economy and depends on mining for one-fourth of GDP -- is a prime example, having suffered the biggest percentage decline in payrolls from the start of the recession in December 2007. The state, which went for Trump, is likely to be among the final two to return to peak employment, in 2022, according to forecasts by IHS Markit economists.

The state’s tourism business, including the Jackson Hole resort and park area, was also slow to recover in the wake of consumers’ household wealth dropping, said Anne Alexander, a University of Wyoming economist. While tourism has since bounced back, the state’s huge energy sector has slumped since 2014.

“There’s been a significant slowdown in the past couple of years,” she said. “Natural gas prices fell first, then oil, and then coal production took a dive.”

The recent energy downturn has taken a toll on a number of states. Moody’s Analytics considers Alaska and West Virginia -- both big producing states -- now the only two in recession. Even so, energy states have been leaders in increasing production and employment since 2007, including North Dakota, South Dakota and Texas, which benefited from earlier booms in prices as well as new lower-cost production techniques.

Nevada Bust

Nevada has also had a tough road back, having failed to reach prerecession levels of GDP and home prices. It was among a handful of states, also including Florida, Georgia, California and Arizona, where the 2006 housing bust was particularly severe. Las Vegas hotels, restaurants and casinos suffered when consumers bolstered savings in the wake of the 2007-2009 downturn.

In northwestern Nevada, business at 600-employee Q&D Construction Inc. is growing again but hasn’t returned to 2006 levels when it employed 1,100 people. The company builds roads, hospitals, schools and airport facilities as well as housing.

“Things are coming back,” but Nevada “has not gotten back to where it once was,” said Lance Semenko, Sparks-based Q&D’s chief operating officer.

The 4.7 percent unemployment rate in Nevada, though below the 5.1 percent level when the recession began, remains above the housing-boom figure of 3.9 percent last seen in early 2006. Nevada, which voted for Clinton, had the highest percentage of homes with mortgages in excess of the value of homes, or negative equity, at 12.4 percent, followed by Florida, Illinois, New Jersey and Connecticut, according to real estate researcher CoreLogic Inc.

“Our recession was longer and deeper so naturally it will take us longer to recover,” said Stephen M. Miller, director for the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas.

The regional disparities aren’t holding back Federal Reserve policy makers from raising their benchmark interest rate and eyeing a reduction in their $4.5 trillion balance sheet. Central bankers, though mindful of the uneven circumstances, look at the country as a whole when making decisions and generally consider the 4.3 percent U.S. unemployment rate to be below the level consistent with full employment.

Recovery ‘Complete’

“The national recovery is absolutely complete,” said Stanford University economist Robert Hall, who heads the National Bureau of Economic Research committee that dates recessions.

Other issues plaguing the laggard states include slow growth in federal spending in New Mexico and below-average education levels in Mississippi and Alabama, economists said.

Connecticut is another story. In the New England state, which went for Clinton, General Electric Co. last year announced it was moving its headquarters to Boston, followed by Aetna Inc. deciding in June to relocate to New York City. Connecticut’s bonds were downgraded in May after the state faced a widening deficit. Florida Governor Rick Scott even visited the state in June to try to persuade companies to move south.

“Taxes and spending that can’t be sustained” are hurting the economy, said Don Klepper-Smith, chief economist at consulting firm DataCore Partners LLC in Durham, Connecticut. “Lack of fiscal discipline is creating an air of uncertainty. There is a loss of confidence in the business community.”

“We are underperforming in a rather dramatic fashion,” he said.

The 23-year-old who saved the world from a devastating cyberattack in May was asleep in his bed in the English seaside town of Ilfracombe last week after a night of partying when another online extortion campaign spread across the globe.

Around 6 p.m. on June 27, Marcus Hutchins, a self-taught computer-security researcher and avid surfer, was awakened by a phone call from a colleague telling him another attack was underway. Dreading a return of the virulent WannaCry malware that he stopped in its tracks the previous month, Hutchins logged on to his computer in the house he shares with his parents and younger brother to scan the latest reports.

By then, more than 80 Ukrainian banks, government agencies and multinational firms including shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S and Russia’s biggest oil company Rosneft PJSC had been hit by a ransomware attack spreading like an electronic plague across their networks. Within 20 minutes, Hutchins later recounted, he got hold of a sample of the malware and was relieved to see it wasn’t another WannaCry, which infected hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries, but something more targeted and less virulent.

Though both attacks took advantage of flaws in Microsoft Corp.’s Windows operating system to spread their payloads, WannaCry used the internet to propagate itself -- each compromised computer would scan and infect another, creating a snowball effect -- while the so-called Petya attack was confined to local networks. Petya appeared bigger at first because hackers hit Ukrainian software company M.E.Doc and used an automatic update feature to download its malware onto the computers of all users of the software, Hutchins said.

Unlikely Hero

Researchers like Hutchins and his colleagues at Los Angeles-based threat-intelligence firm Kryptos Logic are akin to seismologists, scanning the internet for electronic tremors that could signal the next attack. This time he was only an observer, but on May 12 Hutchins stopped the WannaCry attack that crippled organizations from Britain’s National Health Service to Deutsche Bahn in Germany and Renault SA factories across Europe.

With a mop of curly hair, baggy jeans, T-shirt and sneakers, Hutchins is an unlikely hero. He rarely leaves rural north Devon, where he has lived since he was 8, and hadn’t traveled abroad until last year. He learned to program computers at 12 and was tracking and disrupting botnet attacks for his own enjoyment before anyone paid him to do so.

Hutchins started a blog under the pseudonym MalwareTech while still a teenager and was hired by Kryptos in 2015. He said his parents and friends didn’t even know he had a job until the WannaCry attack.

Cheesy Chips

Hutchins was supposed to be enjoying a week’s holiday, but returning home after a lunch of burgers and cheesy chips with a friend and seeing the carnage WannaCry was inflicting, he couldn’t resist jumping in.

“The fact that so many NHS trusts were being hit at the same time was pretty much unprecedented,” Hutchins said in an interview a few weeks after the attack, drinking Coca-Cola in a hotel bar in Ilfracombe, a picturesque but faded tourist town. “That for me was a massive red flag, which showed that this thing was spreading on its own.”

Most ransomware, which encrypts files on a target machine to force its owner to make a payment in exchange for decryption, is spread via email attachments from rogue senders that infect host computers when they’re opened. Hutchins said he’d expect a handful of people to click on a mass email over a few days, not thousands of employees at scores of medical facilities at the same time.

After analyzing a sample of the malware and seeing it spread by exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s network file-sharing protocols, he realized it was using a cyberweapon allegedly stolen from the U.S. National Security Agency. Known as “EternalBlue,” it was part of a cache of sophisticated NSA hacking tools targeting Microsoft software that were obtained by the Shadow Brokers criminal gang last year and leaked onto the internet in April.

Hutchins also noticed a quirk buried deep in the malware code. It tested for the existence of an unregistered nonsensical domain name. He promptly registered the domain for 8.5 pounds ($11) and redirected all traffic to a server designed to capture malicious data, known as a sinkhole, which would allow him to monitor the progress of the attack.

Kill Switch

Although he didn’t realize it at the time, Hutchins had inadvertently triggered the malware’s kill switch. Before infecting and encrypting a computer’s hard drive, WannaCry would query the domain, and as long as it remained unregistered would proceed with the attack. Now, when the malware checked the domain and found it active, it immediately shut down. About 100 million attempts to infect computers, including more than 7 million in the U.S., have been mitigated since then, according to Kryptos data.

“At the time, we were just like ‘Yay, we can track it now,’ we didn’t know that we’d stopped it,” Hutchins said. “The minute we registered the domain we were looking at like 5,000 or 6,000 unique systems all connecting, and it went up to 200,000 within an hour. I remember thinking: Holy shit, this is really big.”

Hutchins is part of a global community of online security researchers and bloggers who battle with hackers and cybercriminals from their home offices at all hours of the day and night. Given the wave of attacks in recent years, they’re in high demand from governments and corporations and can command six-figure salaries while still in their early 20s.

Hutchins said he has been courted by some of the world’s biggest cybersecurity firms. In 2015, he interviewed with Britain’s top-secret Government Communications Headquarters but went to work for Kryptos instead after it made him an offer he said he “couldn’t refuse.”

‘Great Cyberwarriors’

“He’s a natural talent,” said Salim Neino, 33, Kryptos’s chief executive officer, who hired Hutchins after reading his blog. “He was obviously solving hard problems and he wasn’t doing it for monetary reward, and those are some of the key traits of great cyberwarriors.”

Neino, a self-taught programmer who got his first computing job at 15, co-founded Kryptos nine years ago. The firm doesn’t do any marketing and has no salespeople among its 25 employees.

Hutchins said he didn’t ask for a raise after WannaCry because he had just been given one. He wouldn’t say how much he earns, but money goes a long way in Ilfracombe, where 1 in 5 children comes from a family whose income is less than 60 percent of the national average. He said he invests his earnings in stocks and bitcoin, and made thousands of pounds shorting the British currency after the country voted to leave the European Union last year.

Given the nature of his work and his tendency to sound off on social media without much of a filter, Hutchins had kept his online and real-world lives separate.

“No one knew on either side what the other side did,” he said.

Changed Forever

WannaCry changed that forever. After registering the domain that Friday afternoon in May, Hutchins posted a link to it online so others could track the attack’s progress. Within a few hours it became clear that WannaCry had stopped self-propagating, and fellow researchers started tweeting that it was @MalwareTechBlog who had saved the day. Pretty soon he was being bombarded with thousands of emails and direct messages on Twitter from journalists and security companies wanting to know whether their clients had been infected.

Hutchins knew it was only a matter of time before his identity was blown and admits feeling a little scared.

“Generally, you don’t want to advertise what you’re doing as you don’t want to piss off the bad guys,” Hutchins said. “We published the tracker not knowing we’d foiled it. Had I known that, I wouldn’t have publicized that it was me. Angry criminals are the worst criminals.”

For the next 72 hours, Hutchins went without sleep while fending off ever more aggressive attacks from hackers trying to take his servers offline to disable the kill switch and repropagate WannaCry.

Hutchins thinks that was mostly the work of low-level, semi-skilled hackers referred to in the industry as skids, or script kiddies. They aren’t in it for the money, he said, they just like causing as much trouble as possible.

‘Pretty Shocked’

By Sunday, the British media had identified Hutchins as the man who stopped WannaCry, and the next day he had journalists camped outside his house, 170 miles from London, stuffing business cards through his letterbox and ringing the doorbell. At one point Hutchins jumped over the back wall of his yard and fled through a car park.

“When I was outed, my parents were pretty shocked and my friends still don’t believe that I have a job,” Hutchins said. “Being unmasked was pretty horrendous.”

Hutchins claims to not like people very much, but he’s affable and engaging. Several times during a walk around Ilfracombe’s harbor and through its narrow streets, friends and acquaintances called out greetings. He chafes at being identified as a hero and said he doesn’t have plans to move, though he did enjoy a recent trip to Copenhagen to give a speech at an industry convention.

“What we did with WannaCry was impressive in terms of the scale of what we stopped, but on a technical level all we did was register a domain,” Hutchins said. “My employer was already paying me way more than I was worth, so the whole WannaCry thing didn’t really change anything.”

Kryptos’s Neino is adamant that Hutchins deserves to be called a hero and warns that everyone should prepare for more attacks.

“We’re going to see a wave of these attacks if Shadow Brokers make good on their promise to release more exploits,” Neino said. “They’ve made good on every other threat, so there’s no reason to think they won’t this time.”

Petya was proof of more to come. After pulling another all-nighter, Hutchins said, he just wanted to go back to bed.

The global refugee population continues to climb. In 2016 there were 17.2 million refugees, an increase of 7 percent over 2015, according to UNHCR, the UN agency for refugees. For the third straight year, Turkey hosted the most refugees, at 2.9 million, followed by Pakistan, with 1.4 million, and Lebanon with 1 million people. Turkey and Germany are the only Group of 20 nations among the top 10 host countries. More than half of the world’s refugees originated from Syria, Afghanistan and South Sudan. In South Sudan, a growing humanitarian crisis led to an increase of 64 percent during the second half of the year to 1.4 million people.

With nations from China and Germany to Mexico and the U.S. at the G-20 summit table, finding a shared approach is difficult. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has made migration a priority as G-20 summit host, calling on members to back a “Compact With Africa” to promote investment to build up local economies. Europe’s Mediterranean countries such as Italy are among those concerned about new waves of refugees and migrants arriving from North Africa. (Unlike refugees, who flee their homes due to war or persecution, migrants choose to move mainly for better economic opportunities or family reunification.) The influx of arrivals to Italy has prompted Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni to request help from the European Union to deal with the pressure.

The fallout from the Bahamas catastrophe may make it harder to insure events already known for risky behavior.

Already facing numerous lawsuits, Fyre Festival organizer Billy McFarland was arrested on federal charges last week. The government alleged he defrauded investors who bought into Fyre Media Inc., the company behind the music festival which collapsed so spectacularly in the Bahamas a few months back.

But the fiasco’s graduation to prosecution is almost beside the point as far as the festival industry is concerned. Events constructed to attract free-spending youth tend to include some who drink too much or take drugs, and consequently do all the risky things that come with both. Organizers already had it tough when it came to getting insurance. Then Fyre Festival came apart, replete with tent cities, stranded teens, broken promises, and a global media spotlight covering it all.

“How exposed is Fyre Media as a company in the case of litigation?” Fyre Media employees presciently asked management in an early May email. The answer has come in about a dozen lawsuits filed since the concert ended with stranded attendees scrambling for shelter and food on a remote island.

A Fyre-like calamity is the greatest fear of most festival organizers. The majority already seek to protect themselves by obtaining insurance, but it doesn’t come cheap, or easy. Insurers typically begin working with mega-festival organizers well in advance, determining exactly what kind of coverage they need. In some cases, risk and claim specialists will even tour facilities in advance and during the festival in an effort to mitigate any potential issues. In an ideal scenario, risk experts remove every danger and festival-goers stay safe, employees don’t get hurt, the production company doesn’t get sued, and the insurer doesn’t pay out a huge claim. (A lawsuit filed by National Event Services Inc. claimed Fyre Festival didn’t purchase cancelation insurance. McFarland’s attorney declined to comment, and her client has yet to enter a plea in his fraud prosecution.)

Big events, those the caliber of Coachella and Bonnaroo, typically take on at least five kinds of insurance policies: cancelation, including terrorism coverage, general liability, umbrella policies, workers compensation, and business auto coverage, explained Peter Temkins, managing director of entertainment for HUB International. Some will also opt for crime coverage, errors and omissions policies, and directors and officers policies. If videographers are on site, there’s also film insurance.

Festivals can be lucrative, but such policies take out a big chunk. “Music festivals are one of the hardest things to insure because of the alcohol and the drugs,” said Robert Nuccio, president of R.V. Nuccio & Associates Insurance Brokers Inc. “Its a different exposure. Can you keep the drugs and alcohol away? No.”

Cancelation insurance will typically cost 1 to 1.5 percent of the overall cost of an event, as much as $150,000 for a $10 million festival, Temkins said. General liability coverage is priced per head.

“Depending on the type of event it is and the type of music, that will dictate cost,” he said. General liability coverage for an event without camping can run between 30 and 45 cents an attendee, while an overnight event that must protect festival goers could be as much as $1.50 a person. Throw a myriad of other insurance options into the mix, and the cost could be well over $300,000.

Insurers aren’t always rushing to underwrite these mega policies for events defined by drunk, partying teenagers. The decision is often based on what might be considered to be adult supervision: Before Temkins agrees to accept a client, he takes a close look at who is managing the festival. “The most important thing to me is not who owns the festival, but who is running the festival. I want to know who the actual boots on the ground are, who is really doing everything,” he said. “I know a lot of production people who do festivals. They’re going to do their job the same way every time, no matter who owns it.”

Travel with us, drive with us, eat with us. Get our weekly Pursuits newsletter.

Specific people in the festival chain-of-command, including the site manager, production manager, security director, and medical director, are also considered when a policy is being written. “Safety is a very, very important component for us,” said Sue McGuirl, head of Entertainment, North America, for Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty, one of the largest event insurers. The company said it’s involved in some aspect of insuring about 90 percent of America’s music festivals. “They need to have evacuation plans, there needs to be a decision-maker if there’s a weather event, there has to be a communications strategy.”

Inevitably, there will be claims, with spectator liability being the most common, said Nuccio. “Most of them are liability claims: slip and fall, molestation, alleged rape, false arrest, false imprisonment, assault, battery.”

In late June, Insomniac Holdings LLC and Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. were sued for the wrongful death of attendee Tom Nicholas at the Electric Daisy Carnival festival in Las Vegas, alleging the event made it difficult to access water and medical staff. In 2016, the mother of Emily Michelle Tran, who died at the HARD Summer Festival in 2014 after taking MDMA and having a seizure, sued Live Nation for negligence and wrongful death. Insomniac and Live Nation declined to comment on the litigation.

Risk assessment can help curb spectator lawsuits, but little can be done when the weather takes a turn. Hurricane Irene in 2011 led to issues for several festivals which Temkins helped insure. Electric Zoo, which he worked with at the time, had to stop construction, then reassemble after the storm passed. Another event he helped insure in Houston suffered from such bad rain that it had to be moved last minute.

Insurance, while a great safety blanket, isn’t a magic wand. There are caveats to every agreement, especially when it comes to festivals, Temkins said.

“I’m not convinced that if Fyre had cancelation coverage, it would’ve covered” the costs of refunding attendees, he said, alluding to allegations made by former employees that the organizers were unprepared for the event. “The cause of that was not outside of their control.”

The unsold wheat sitting inside Buzz Mattelin’s grain silos in Montana should offer some comfort to American noodle lovers.

Benchmark wheat futures in Chicago have jumped more than 37 percent this year -- off to their fastest start since 1979 -- after a plunge in North American planting was followed by drought that’s showing signs of damaging the harvest. That’s raised concern that it will cost more to make all sorts of flour-based foods like bread and pizza and cakes.

But U.S. stockpiles of the high-protein durum wheat used in pasta noodles including spaghetti and macaroni are the biggest in 11 years, left over from a harvest last season that was the largest since 2009. And Canadian inventories are up 51 percent. Mattelin, who farms about 900 acres of durum near Culbertson, Montana, says he’s still got 25 percent of the grain he collected last year, while his 2017 crop wilts from lack of moisture.

“National yields will be lower in the U.S., but we are starting with a strong supply left from last year’s big crops,” said Jeff Van Pevanage, the president and chief executive officer at Portland-based Columbia Grain International, a unit of Japanese trader Marubeni Corp. “The U.S. has a comfortable supply, and Canada can export more. A lot of mills already bought ahead for the third and fourth quarters.”

Even with higher prices, consumers probably won’t see much impact. Wheat accounts for only a small part of the cost to make most products -- often just a few cents for a loaf of bread. In previous years, when durum wheat surged, retail pasta prices barely budged.

The Montana durum price rose 33 percent in June, the most for that month since before 1999, as drought intensified from the northern Great Plains to the southern Canadian Prairies, where most of the North American wheat crops are grown. Before 2017, wheat had tumbled for four straight years, so U.S. farmers planted 20 percent less this season. Canada cut acreage by 16 percent, sowing more canola than wheat for the first time ever. Spot prices in the Golden Triangle area of Montana reached $7 a bushel from $5.25 in May and April.

At the same time, the average retail price of spaghetti and macaroni was $1.272 a pound at the end of May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The price has neither risen nor fallen by more than 13 cents in a year since 2008, even when wheat skyrocketed in 2011 and 2014.

A bushel of durum wheat can produce about 42 pounds of macaroni or spaghetti, according to Jim Peterson, marketing director of the North Dakota Wheat Commission. Even if durum prices continue to climb, it’s unlikely that individual pasta packages will get more expensive, he said.

Still, there are signs of trouble ahead for growers in North America, where the U.S. and Canada had been expected to be the world’s biggest exporters of wheat after Russia. The U.S. Department of Agriculture last month forecast domestic wheat output will plunge 21 percent, the most since 1992, after farmers planted the fewest acres in a century. In Canada, production will fall 11 percent, the third decline in four seasons.

The northern U.S. has been plagued by dryness this year, and conditions for the domestic spring-wheat crop are their worst for this time since 1988. Much of North Dakota, Montana and South Dakota are in a moderate to extreme drought, according to most recent U.S. Drought Monitor data. Canada also is experiencing a hot, dry summer, according to MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg, Maryland.

The price of spring wheat, the high-protein variety favored for hard rolls, bagels and yeast breads, has surged 52 percent this year and topped $8 a bushel this week for the first time since a devastating drought in 2012.
