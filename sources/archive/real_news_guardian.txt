Head of Iraq inquiry says he does not believe former PM was clear enough about his decisions in the run-up to war

Sir John Chilcot has said he does not believe Tony Blair was “straight with the nation” about his decisions in the run-up to the Iraq war.

The chairman of the public inquiry into the 2003 conflict said the former prime minister had however been “emotionally truthful” in his account of events leading up to the war, meaning he relied on both emotion and fact.

Breaking his long silence on the matter in an interview with the BBC’s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, Chilcot said: “Tony Blair is always and ever an advocate. He makes the most persuasive case he can. Not departing from the truth but persuasion is everything.”

Chilcot was later asked if Blair was as truthful with him and the public as he should have been during the seven-year inquiry.

He replied: “Can I slightly reword that to say I think any prime minister taking a country into war has got to be straight with the nation and carry it, so far as possible, with him or her. I don’t believe that was the case in the Iraq instance.”

A spokesman for Blair told the BBC that “all these issues” had been dealt with.

Chilcot’s report, published in July last year, found that the former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein posed “no imminent threat” at the time of the invasion of his country in 2003, and the war was fought on the basis of “flawed” intelligence. It found that the cabinet’s decision to invade was made in circumstances that were “far from satisfactory”.

While giving evidence to the inquiry, Blair denied he had taken the country to war on the basis of a lie over Hussein’s supposed weapons of mass destruction.

Asked in the BBC interview if he felt Blair had given the fullest version of events to the inquiry, Chilcot said: “I think he gave an – what was – I hesitate to say this, rather, but I think it was, from his perspective and standpoint, emotionally truthful and I think that came out also in his press conference after the launch statement.

“I think he was under – as you said just now – very great emotional pressure during those sessions … He was suffering. He was deeply engaged. Now in that state of mind and mood you fall back on your instinctive skills and reactions, I think.”

He agreed the questioning sessions with Blair had been “extraordinarily intense”.

Chilcot also revealed he was given just eight minutes to decide if he wanted to lead the Iraq inquiry. “I knew that I could do it in a way that would not be the same as other inquiries which had proved problematic, frankly, in their procedure,” he said.

Asked how his would be different, Chilcot replied: “I was really clear from the outset, even before the parliamentary statement by Gordon Brown on the Monday, that it shouldn’t be an accusatory inquiry, it should be an inquiry into the facts, the history, in effect.”

Chilcot defended the length of the inquiry, which took nine years to complete: “There was so much stuff. It was a history of, in effect, starting in 2001, of eight to nine years of diplomatic, military, political resource, every sort of aspect.”

David Cameron pressured him to speed up the inquiry, Chilcot said, “which I think would have been unforgivable, a terrible waste of a lot of time and effort and truth”.

Asked how Cameron communicated, he said: “Essentially messages via the cabinet secretary or senior Cabinet Office staff, and then eventually public correspondence. Which I had no difficulty in replying to politely. Firmness and politeness are different things.”

Maj Gen Tim Cross, who advised Blair on the invasion of Iraq, said it was significant that Chilcot suggested emotion swayed Blair’s decision to go to war.

Speaking to BBC Breakfast he said: “Sir John didn’t say that he [Blair] did not tell the truth, but obviously his emotions had a big impact on his decision-making process.”

Asked whether Blair’s emotions intervened with rational decision-making, he said: “I’m sure it did. When I met Tony Blair in Kosovo, when my brigade ran refugee camps, he literally wept in the tents with the refugees.”

He added: “Sir John reaffirmed in this interview that one of his criticisms was that this was not last resort, one of the just war criteria.



“When I briefed Tony Blair it was quite clear that he felt that this was a necessity, that there was a just cause, that we had to do something about this. My own sense is that he wasn’t that far short, if he was short.

“I have no problem with the fact that in the end we did away with Saddam Hussein. I watched the mass graves being dug up in Iraq, this was a nasty brutal dictator.”

Fentanyl and carfentanyl – which are many times stronger than morphine – found in bodies of 46 people who died this year

Dozens of drug deaths in the UK this year are being linked to the opiates fentanyl and carfentanyl, which are being added to heroin even though they are many times stronger.

The National Crime Agency says dealers are mixing the class A drugs with heroin, and the substances have been found in the bodies of 46 people who died this year, although the exact causes of their deaths remained uncertain.

Many toxicologists have only recently started looking for fentanyl and carfentanyl in postmortem examinations, and cases involving the substances have yet to reach coroners’ courts – meaning there has been little public discussion of the impact of the drugs.

Public Health England said heroin users should be “extra careful” when using the drug, urging them to test a small amount first and not to take it alone. In April, the body issued an alert to medical and emergency services to be vigilant following a spate of deaths in the north of England.

Fentanyl is a synthetic opiate, which can be prescribed as a painkiller in carefully measured doses. It is up to 100 times stronger than morphine. Its analogue carfentanyl is 10,000 times stronger and has been used as an elephant tranquilliser.

Fentanyl hit international headlines in June, when it was found that Prince died after overdosing on it. In the US, fentanyl is one of the drugs blamed for the rapid rise in overdose deaths and widespread opioid addiction.

Harry Sumnall, a professor of substance use at the Public Health Institute at Liverpool John Moores University, said it was unclear why fentanyl and carfentanyl were appearing on the black market in the UK. He suggested it could have been bought on the dark web, and that new suppliers may be trying to enter the market.

“Whether it’s so-called user dealers who are buying a local supply, or new actors trying to enter the market but at a much lower level than the established heroin gangs, we don’t really know,” said Sumnall.

Simon Hudson, a technical director at LGC, which tests biological samples from coroners for pathology labs, said carfentanyl or fentanyl had been found in 46 cases since March.



He said about three or four of the 15 cases he received every week were testing positive for the substances but that in most instances a coroner had not yet recorded an official cause of death.

Hudson said that 20 micrograms of carfentanyl could be enough to kill someone. “If you look at a grain of sugar, that is one or two milligrams, so 20 micrograms is a 50th of that. You wouldn’t even be able to see that if it was on the desk in front of you. It would be like a spec of dust.

Fentanyl: drug 50 times more potent than heroin ravages New Hampshire Read more

“So if somebody’s trying to cut heroin and make it uniform throughout the whole amount of heroin, that’s pretty much impossible,” he said. “Taking it is like playing Russian roulette. One portion of heroin won’t have anything in it, but another will have a couple of specs and it’ll be enough to kill you.”

The majority of drug overdoses thought to have involved fentanyl and carfentanyl are in the Yorkshire and the Humber region, but police forces across the north of England, Northern Ireland and Hampshire have issued warnings after finding evidence that heroin was being mixed with the drugs.



In April, Humberside police confirmed that two people in Hull had died after taking heroin mixed with fentanyl. DCI Paul Kirby said the force was also trying to establish how a number of other drug users had died in the city.



The same month, police said they were investigating whether two deaths in the Leeds area were connected to “unusually strong heroin or heroin derivates”. In May, police linked the death of a 43-year-old man in Wakefield to carfentanyl-laced heroin.

A few days later, South Yorkshire police said they were investigating seven deaths around Barnsley. They said they were looking into the possibility that the dead had taken heroin contaminated with carfentanyl and fentanyl.

Rosanna O’Connor, the director of drugs, alcohol and tobacco at Public Health England, said the organisation was working closely with coroners, the police, drug testing labs and local drug services to get more information on confirmed and suspected cases.

US president will say west must ‘defend our civilisation’ from terrorism, bureaucracy and erosion of traditions

Donald Trump will use a landmark speech in Warsaw on Thursday to warn that the future of the west is in doubt if nations do not show more resolve in facing challenges.

“The defence of the west ultimately rests not only on means but also on the will of its people to prevail,” Trump will say, according to excerpts released by the White House.

“The fundamental question of our time is whether the west has the will to survive.”

Trump will paint a picture of the west facing existential challenges to “defend our civilisation” from terrorism, bureaucracy and the erosion of traditions, according to the extracts.

He will point to Poland – which in the last century endured Nazi and Soviet occupation – as an example of resolve.

“The story of Poland is the story of a people who have never lost hope, who have never been broken, and who have never forgotten who they are,” he will say.

In a nod to the conservative values he shares with Poland’s controversial ruling Law and Justice party, Trump will also call on the west to defend its traditions.

“Americans, Poles, and the nations of Europe value individual freedom and sovereignty,” he will say.

“We must work together to counter forces, whether they come from inside or out, from the south or the east, that threaten over time to undermine these values and to erase the bonds of culture, faith and tradition that make us who we are.”

Trump will also issue a Reaganesque call to tackle bureaucracy, which he will frame as more than just an inconvenience or byproduct of a rules-based society.

“On both sides of the Atlantic, our citizens are confronted by yet another danger – one firmly within our control. This danger is invisible to some but familiar to the Poles. The steady creep of government bureaucracy that drains the vitality and wealth of the people.

“The west became great not because of paperwork and regulations but because people were allowed to chase their dreams and pursue their destinies,” he will say.

Before the speech, Trump and the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, held a press conference touching on a range of issues including Russia, Islamic State, North Korea and the US president’s recent spat with CNN over a tweet posted by Trump of a video of him wrestling a man with a CNN logo superimposed on his head.

Trump praised Poland as being one of the “few nations” that met its financial obligations to Nato. He said since he had pressured other member nations to meet their financial obligations the “money had been pouring in”.

Trump said the US was also working with Poland “in response to Russia’s actions and destabilising behaviour”.

And he said nations must unite to confront Isis and terror groups but also “the threat from North Korea”.

“We will confront it very strongly. President Duma and I call on our nations to publicly demonstrate to North Korea and demonstrate there are consequences to their very bad behaviour.”

On Syria, Trump said both nations recognised the war-torn country required “a political solution that does not advance Iran’s destructive agenda and does not allow terrorist organisations to return”.

Asked about North Korea’s recent missile tests and Trump’s planned response, the president replied: “I don’t know. We’ll see what happens. I don’t like to talk about what I have planned.

“I have some pretty severe things we’re thinking about. I don’t draw red lines. President Obama drew red lines. I’m the one who makes it look a little bit better than it was.

“I would have done a lot sooner and you wouldn’t have the same situation as you do in Syria. We’ll just take a look at what’s coming over the weeks and months. It’s a shame they’re behaving in this way. They’re behaving in a very dangerous manner.”

Asked to comment on the wrestling tweet, Trump said: “What CNN did was unfortunate for them. They have some pretty serious problems.

“They have been fake news for a long time. They’ve been covering me in a very dishonest way. NBC is equally as bad, despite the fact I made them a fortune with the Apprentice.

“CNN has really taken it too seriously and they have hurt themselves very badly. We want to see honest – beautiful, free – but honest press. We want to see fair press. We don’t want fake news. Not everybody is fake news. But we don’t want fake news.”

Trump closed the press conference with a rambling response to a call from a reporter to “finally answer yes or no” whether he thought Russia interfered in the 2016 US election.

He said: “I think it was Russia; I think it was other countries. I think it could well have been Russia and it could have been other countries. A lot of people interfere. It’s been happening a long time.”

Trump accused the former US president Barack Obama of ignoring warnings given before the election that Russia was interfering with it.

“He was told in early August, Russia was trying to get involved, meddling, pretty strongly. He did nothing about it. The reason is he thought Hillary was going to win,” Trump said. “I agree it was Russia but I think it was other people or other countries. No one really knows, no one really knows for sure.”

The press conference ended with the reporter being shouted over by the Polish mediator to end her questioning.

US president says he is determined to confront threat from Pyongyang, after his ambassador to UN raises prospect of military action if diplomacy fails

Donald Trump has said he is considering some “very severe things” in response to North Korea’s successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) this week, as he called on other nations to exert pressure on Pyongyang over its “very bad behaviour”.

The president’s comments, made in Poland, came after the US ambassador to the UN made a push for new sanctions at a security council meeting and said America’s “considerable military forces” could be used against North Korea.



Nikki Haley told the meeting the US would submit a draft resolution within days “that raises the international response in a way that is proportionate to North Korea’s escalation”, but warned Washington had options if diplomacy failed.

“The United States is prepared to use the full range of our capabilities to defend ourselves and our allies,” Haley said. “One of our capabilities lies with our considerable military forces. We will use them, if we must, but we prefer not to have to go in that direction.”

She said the US was eyeing penalties against “any country that does business with this outlaw regime”.



Trump said the US would confront the North Korean threat, but noted that he would not draw a red line. “I don’t like to talk about what I have planned, but I have some pretty severe things that we’re thinking about,” he said. “That doesn’t mean we’re going to do them.”

Some administration officials are still hoping to persuade China to increase economic pressure on Pyongyang.

Trump is scheduled to meet the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg, where he will travel from Poland later on Thursday.



Trump and Vladimir Putin are also expected to address growing North Korean provocations at their meeting on Friday.

Haley did not go into detail about the proposed resolution but said that if the council was united, the international community could cut off major sources of hard currency to North Korea, restrict oil to its military and weapons programs, increase air and maritime restrictions, and hold senior officials accountable.



China has already called for restraint from all sides, after joining diplomatic forces with Russia to suggest that North Korea suspend its missile programme in return for a moratorium on large-scale US and South Korean military exercises.

Donald Trump's romance with China's Xi has cooled, 'ass-kicking' could lie ahead Read more

China is pushing for talks between world powers and North Korea on dismantling its nuclear programme but the US maintains that Pyongyang must first halt its missile and nuclear tests.



China’s UN ambassador, Liu Jieyi, said North Korea’s missile test was a “flagrant violation” of UN resolutions, but aimed his missive at both sides of the conflict.



“We call on all the parties concerned to exercise restraint, avoid provocative actions, and belligerent rhetoric, demonstrate the will for unconditional dialogue and work actively together to defuse the tension,” Jieyi said.



That would cover deployments like the live-fire ballistic missile exercise early on Wednesday that officials in Seoul said was intended as a warning to Pyongyang.

The Pentagon said on Wednesday that the missile test-fired by North Korea was not one the US had previously seen, and was fired from a new launch point.



Jeff Davis, the Pentagon spokesman, told reporters that as no airspace had been cleared for the test, commercial planes and ships in the surrounding area had been exposed to risk. He said: “This act demonstrates that North Korea poses a threat to the United States and our allies and we remain prepared to defend ourselves and our allies and to use the full range of capabilities at our disposal.”



Kim delivered his own message on Wednesday, with the state Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) quoting him as saying: “American bastards would be not very happy with this gift sent on the July 4 anniversary.”



The news agency claimed the North Korean missile was capable of carrying a “large, heavy nuclear warhead” that could survive re-entry into the earth’s atmosphere.

Kim was quoted as saying the North’s long confrontation with Washington had entered the “final stage” and that Pyongyang would not put its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles up for negotiation “unless the US hostile policy and nuclear threats come to an end completely”.

A report in its state media said Kim urged his scientists to “frequently send big and small ‘gift packages’ to the Yankees”.

Questions remain about whether the North can miniaturize a nuclear weapon to fit a missile nosecone, or if it has mastered the technology needed for it to survive re-entry into the earth’s atmosphere.



Some experts believe the North already has the ability to mount warheads on shorter-range missiles that can strike South Korea and Japan, home to dozens of US military bases and about 80,000 US troops.

Investigators seeking to speak to attacker’s brother Hashem in Libya but do not believe large network was behind bombing

Police investigating the bombing of Manchester Arena do not believe that attacker Salman Abedi acted alone, they said on Thursday.

Investigators do not believe that Abedi, who died in the suicide attack in May, which killed 22 other people, was part of a large network. But in a briefing DCS Russ Jackson, head of north-west counter-terrorism policing, said that others were involved and there could still be further arrests.

He said: “We don’t have evidence of a large network. We do however suspect others were either aware or complicit in the knowledge of this attack.”



Jackson said the police still wanted to talk to Abedi’s brother Hashem, currently being held in Libya.

“We are currently engaging with the Crown Prosecution Service and the Libyan authorities,” he said. “This is a live criminal investigation where central to it are 22 murdered people, with grieving families.”

Counter-terrorism police initially feared that Abedi was helped by a network of accomplices but concluded that he acted largely alone as he assembled the nail bomb.

Abedi was born in Manchester to Libyan parents, who moved back to Tripoli in recent years, along with his younger siblings. He is believed to have visited Libya shortly before the attack, arriving back in the UK on 18 May.

Nobel laureate and democracy campaigner was released from jail last month on medical parole after liver cancer diagnosis

The condition of China’s most famous political prisoner, the democracy campaigner and Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, has worsened, family friends and local reports have said.



Liu, 61, was jailed in 2009 for allegedly trying to topple China’s one-party state. He was given medical parole last month after being diagnosed with terminal liver cancer.

The dissident writer has been receiving treatment at a hospital in the north-eastern city of Shenyang where, according to one report, he has been separated from other patients and is guarded by plainclothes agents from China’s paramilitary armed police.

Writing on Twitter on Thursday, Ye Du, a dissident poet and family friend, said Liu’s condition had worsened and that relatives had been told he did not have much more time to live.

Citing medical staff and another family friend, the Hong Kong broadcaster RTHK reported that doctors had stopped giving Liu medication because he was too weak for treatment. He was also no longer able to eat. Yang Jianli, the friend, told RTHK Liu had developed a kidney problem as a result of the accumulation of fluid in his abdomen.

A photograph that circulated among friends and activists on Thursday showed a visibly emaciated Liu standing beside his wife, the writer Liu Xia.



Liu’s worsening health has distressed his friends and many admirers. “As someone who had a chance to talk to him in the past, I really feel heartbroken to see how he has been treated,” said Patrick Poon, a Hong Kong-based Amnesty International activist.

For the Chinese government it represents a public relations disaster, coming on the eve of the G20 summit in Hamburg. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, had hoped to use the two-day summit to bolster China’s case to be seen as a responsible and forward-looking world power. The state now faces international embarrassment and censure over its treatment of the 2010 Nobel peace prize winner.

The Global Times – a state-run tabloid that uses the Communist party description of Liu as a “convicted criminal”, rather than a political prisoner – emphasised the efforts that were now being put into his treatment. “A team of medical experts from all over China headed by a renowned surgeon from Beijing has arrived in Shenyang to help treat Liu Xiaobo,” the newspaper reported on Thursday.

However, campaigners and critics dismiss such reports as a smokescreen intended to cover-up Beijing’s persecution of Liu and his family.



Poon said Beijing was attempting to shift the focus on to how much medical attention Liu was receiving to shirk responsibility for its “cold-blooded” treatment of the democracy activist.

Beijing had repeatedly rejected calls for Liu to be treated abroad, Poon pointed out. “They simply ignored Liu’s modest request: to live out his last days in dignity,” he said. “Now, we might lose him any time soon.”

Reckitt Benckiser says ‘Petya’ ransomware – which also affected FedEx and others – disrupted production and deliveries

The “Petya” ransomware cyber-attack on some of the world’s biggest companies last week could cost Reckitt Benckiser, the maker of Nurofen painkillers and Durex condoms, an estimated £100m in revenue.

Reckitt Benckiser said the attack on 27 June had disrupted production and deliveries of goods to customers in several countries.



“Consequently, we were unable to ship and invoice some orders to customers prior to the close of the quarter,” the British consumer goods company said in a statement on Thursday. “Some of our factories are currently still not operating normally but plans are in place to return to full operation.”

Business Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news Read more

Reckitt Benckiser said it was still assessing the full financial impact of the attack on the company.

“We expect that some of the revenue lost from the second quarter will be recovered in the third quarter. However, the continued production difficulties in some factories mean that we also expect to lose some further revenue permanently.”

The Slough-based company now expects like-for-like net revenue in 2017 to increase by about 2%, down from an earlier growth forecast of 3%. With the company making almost £10bn in revenues in 2016, that would equate to about £100m in lost revenue.

Reckitt’s shares were among the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 in early trading on Thursday, down 2%.

The company has operations in more than 60 countries and sells its products in most countries, employing about 37,000 people worldwide. The sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote has benefited companies like Reckitt Benckiser, because it has significant operations outside the UK.

Companies including the UK-based advertising group WPP, Danish shipping company AP Moller-Maersk, and US delivery service FedEx, were hit by last week’s cyber-attack.

Maersk, the world’s largest shipping company, said it had been forced to redirect ships to alternative locations because the attack on its computer systems left it unable to dock and unload containers at some of its ports.

Ukraine government, banks and electricity grid hit hardest, but companies in France, Denmark and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania also attacked

Victims of a major ransomware cyberattack that has spread through the US and Europe can no longer unlock their computers even if they pay the ransom.

The “Petya” ransomware has caused serious disruption at large firms including the advertising giant WPP, French construction materials company Saint-Gobain and Russian steel and oil firms Evraz and Rosneft.

Infected computers display a message demanding a Bitcoin ransom worth $300. Those who pay are asked to send confirmation of payment to an email address. However, that email address has been shut down by the email provider.

“We do not tolerate any misuse of our platform,” said the German email provider Posteo in a blog post.

This means that there is no longer any way for people who decide to pay the ransom to contact the attacker for a decryption key to unlock their computer.

“This is not an experienced ransomware operator,” said Ryan Kalember, senior vice-president of cybersecurity strategy at Proofpoint.

The attack was first reported in Ukraine, where the government, banks, state power utility and Kiev’s airport and metro system were all affected. The radiation monitoring system at Chernobyl was taken offline, forcing employees to use hand-held counters to measure levels at the former nuclear plant’s exclusion zone.

The food giant Mondelez, legal firm DLA Piper, Danish shipping and transport giant AP Moller-Maersk and Heritage Valley Health System, which runs hospitals and care facilities in Pittsburgh, also said their systems had been hit by the malware.

WPP said in a statement that the computer systems at several of its subsidiary companies had been affected, adding that it was “assessing the situation and taking appropriate measures”.



In an internal memo to staff, one WPP firm said it was the target of “a massive global malware attack, affecting all Windows servers, PCs and laptops”. It warned employes to turn off and disconnect all machines using Windows.

Some technology experts said the attack appeared consistent with an “updated variant” of a virus known as Petya or Petrwrap, a ransomware that locks computer files and forces users to pay a designated sum to regain access.

But analysts at cyber security firm Kaspersky Labs said they had traced the infections to “a new ransomware that has not been seen before”. The “NotPetya” attack had hit 2,000 users in Russia, Ukraine, Poland, France, Italy, the UK, Germany and the US, Kaspersky said.

Last month’s WannaCry or WannaCrypt ransomware attack affected more than 230,000 computers in over 150 countries, with the UK’s national health service, Spanish phone giant Telefónica and German state railways among those hardest hit.



Symantec cyber security experts said they had confirmed the ransomware in the current attack was using the same exploit – a program that takes advantage of a software vulnerability - as WannaCry.

The exploit - called EternalBlue - was leaked by the Shadow Brokers hacker group in April and is thought to have been developed by the US National Security Agency.

To spread within companies that installed the patch to protect themselves against WannaCry, the Petya ransomware appears to have two other ways of spreading rapidly within an organisation, by targeting the network’s administrator tools.

It’s not yet clear how computers became infected with the ransomware in the first place, but it doesn’t seem to be through email as happened with WannaCry, said Kalember.

Pictures circulating on social media on Tuesday of screens purportedly affected by the attack showed a message stating, “Your files are no longer accessible because they have been encrypted,” and demanding a $300 ransom in the Bitcoin digital currency.

The attack affected all business units at Maersk, including container shipping, port and tug boat operations, oil and gas production, drilling services, and oil tankers, the company said, as well as seventeen container terminals.



“We can confirm that Maersk IT systems are down across multiple sites and business units due to a cyber-attack,” the Copenhagen-based firm said on Twitter. “We continue to assess the situation.”

The disruptions in Ukraine follow a rash of hacking attempts on state websites in late 2016 and a succession of attacks on the national electricity grid that prompted security chiefs to call for improved cyber defences.

The country’s prime minister, Volodymyr Groysman, said the attack was “unprecedented” but vital systems had not been affected. “Our IT experts are doing their job and protecting critical infrastructure,” he said. “The attack will be repelled and the perpetrators will be tracked down.”

In a bid to calm public fears about the attack, which temporarily shut down the country’s main airport and prevented travellers from using the Kiev metro, the authorities tweeted a GIF of a dog nonchalantly drinking tea in a room on fire.

Ukraine / Україна (@Ukraine) Some of our gov agencies, private firms were hit by a virus. No need to panic, we’re putting utmost efforts to tackle the issue 👌 pic.twitter.com/RsDnwZD5Oj

Deputy prime minister Pavlo Rozenko earlier tweeted a picture of a darkened computer screen and said the government’s IT system had been shut down. The state grid, Ukrenergo, said its system had been hit but power supplies were unaffected.

The central bank said an “unknown virus” was to blame for the latest attacks. “As a result of these cyber-attacks, these banks are having difficulties with client services and carrying out banking operations,” it said in a statement.



Ukraine has blamed Russia for previous cyber-ttacks, including one on its power grid at the end of 2015 that left part of western Ukraine temporarily without electricity. Russia has denied carrying out cyber-attacks on Ukraine.



Nicolas Duvinage, head of the French military’s digital crime unit, told Agence France-Presse the attack was “a bit like a flu epidemic in winter”, adding: “We will get many of these viral attack waves in coming months.”

The growing fight against cyber-attacks has seen protection spending surge around the world, with the global cyber security market estimated to be worth some £94bn ($120bn) this year – more than 30 times its size just over a decade ago.

Joseph Rowntree Foundation says inflation and benefit cuts are pushing decent standard of living further out of reach

Rising inflation and less generous state benefits have made it harder over the past year for families on tight budgets to enjoy what the public considers a decent standard of living, according to one of Britain’s leading thinktanks.

The Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) said that despite an above-inflation increase in the “national living wage”, low-income families were falling further behind a minimum income standard.

The thinktank said less generous in-work benefits had made life tougher for all low-income families with children, and that lone-parent single-breadwinner families were the hardest hit.

Each year, the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University provides a minimum income standard for the JRF, which acts as a barometer of living standards for households on low incomes.

While not a measure of poverty, the minimum income standard is based on feedback from the public on what it thinks people need to achieve a decent living standard. It includes money for school trips, Christmas presents and swimming lessons, and is updated annually to take account of economic trends and policy changes.

Consumer confidence is lowest since Brexit vote aftermath, survey finds Read more

The research found that despite the national living wage rising from £7.20 to £7.50, the gains had been offset by the rise in the cost of living, the freeze on tax credits and benefits, and wage increases being clawed back through reduced in-work benefits.

The JRF said a single person now needed to earn £17,900 a year to reach the minimum income standard. A dual-earner couple with two children needed to earn £20,400 each, while a lone parent with a preschool child had to earn £25,900. Developments over the past 12 months had made achieving these targets more difficult.

According to the report, a single-breadwinner family was £120 a week short of achieving the minimum income standard this year, up from £103 a week in 2016. An £11.24 pay rise from the national living wage had been offset by a £9.03 reduction in tax credits and housing benefit, and a £1.25 increase in tax and national insurance payments. The resulting 96p a week increase in pay had been dwarfed by a £17.75 rise in living costs, widening the gap between income and outgoings by £16.79 a week.

A lone parent was £55 a week short of the minimum income standard in 2016, but the shortfall widened to £67 a week in 2017. An £11.24 pay rise from the national living wage had been offset by a £3.51 reduction in tax credits and housing benefit, and a £1.44 increase in tax and national insurance payments. Net pay rose by £6.29 a week, but living costs added £18.55 to weekly expenditure, widening the gap with the minimum income standard by £12.26 a week.

The JRF said the gap for a working couple on low incomes had widened from £50 to £59 a week over the past 12 months.

Public sector pay cap is matter for future budgets, says Grayling Read more

Campbell Robb, chief executive of the JRF, said: “Struggling families tell us, as well as juggling the bills, it’s things like after-school clubs and swimming lessons that have to be sacrificed to cover the essentials.

“With the Bank of England forecasting inflation will increase even higher this year, families are facing no respite. We need the government to take action and ensure living standards do not fall backwards. Lifting the freeze on working-age benefits and tax credits must be the start, along with allowing people to keep more of their earnings.”

Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: “The government needs a proper plan to get wages rising. Ministers must stop holding down the pay of public sector workers, and give them their first proper pay rise in seven years. The minimum wage needs to rise faster, to reach £10 an hour as soon as possible.”

Rising cost of package holidays one factor in unexpected May increase, with inflation continuing to outpace UK wage growth

UK inflation rose to a four-year high in May as the pound’s sharp fall since the Brexit vote worked its way through the economy, intensifying the squeeze on household budgets.

The increasing cost of computer games and package holidays helped push up inflation to 2.9% last month, above the expectation of economists that it would remain at the 2.7% rate seen in April. The year-on-year rise in the consumer prices index (CPI) means prices continue to go up faster than wages for many workers, further denting living standards.

Inflation has been steadily increasing since the EU referendum result a year ago, which triggered a sharp drop in the value of the pound and pushed up the cost of goods imported from abroad. Inflation was 0.3% in May 2016, a month before the Brexit vote.

Higher oil prices have also added to the upward pressure on inflation. But in the latest official figures, there was evidence that sterling was a key factor. Statisticians highlighted the rising prices of package holidays, reflecting the growing cost of travelling abroad for Britons because of the weaker pound.

The Office for National Statistics said higher food and electricity prices also contributed to the inflation figure. This continues a pattern of essentials becoming increasingly expensive, leaving households with less to spend on treats. Consumer spending has slowed as a result, holding back the pace of overall economic growth.

The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said the inflation figures underlined the pressure on the new government to help households cope with rising living costs.



“The election showed that working people are struggling. And the biggest price rises in four years won’t provide any comfort,” she said.

“Working people are still £20 a week worse off, on average, than they were before the crash, and now rising prices are hammering their pay packets again. The new government must stop the real wage slide. Ministers must focus on delivering better-paid jobs all around the UK.”

Tim Roache, the general secretary of the GMB union, said: “Too often there is more month than money left after pay day. Ending the public sector pay freeze and making sure all workers are paid a decent wage is an absolute must and it needs to be on the agenda for the Queen’s speech.”

A Treasury spokesman said: “The government is helping families with the everyday cost of living by keeping taxes low, freezing fuel duty and increasing the ‘national living wage’.”

Inflation remains higher than the average wage growth of 2.1% year on year in the three months to March. Wage figures due on Wednesday were expected to show the gap between underlying pay growth and the inflation increase widened further in April.

The higher-than-expected inflation figure will intensify the debate over how long the Bank of England may leave interest rates at the record low of 0.25%. Inflation is well above the Bank’s 2% target, but policymakers have said they are happy to tolerate some overshoot because they want to support growth and employment as the UK prepares to begin Brexit negotiations.

The Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) will meet this week to set interest rates and announce its decision at noon on Thursday.

Oliver Kolodseike, a senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research consultancy, said: “Under normal circumstances, the Bank of England would have a sufficient set of arguments to justify an interest rate rise.

“That said, the recent rise in inflation was partly driven by external factors such as the oil price and the depreciation of the pound ... Another argument for the Bank to keep monetary policy on hold is that a rise in interest rates would increase the cost of borrowing, at a time at which consumers are already feeling a squeeze on their incomes as wage growth remains stubbornly low.

“Add to this uncertainty regarding the UK’s future outside the European Union and it seems sensible for the Bank to keep interest rates at their current levels.”



The ONS figures showed that its preferred measure of inflation, CPIH, which includes owner occupiers’ housing costs, hit a five-year high of 2.7% in May, up from 2.6% in April.

Its measure of how much manufacturers are having to pay for raw materials and energy showed that these cost pressures continued to ease off last month. Input prices increased by 11.6% in the year to May, down from a 15.6% rise in the year to April. This took pressure off companies to raise the prices they charge customers, and factory gate inflation held at 3.6% in May for the third month in a row

Jonathan Athow, the ONS deputy national statistician, said: “The rate of increase in factory gate prices has levelled now that manufacturing input costs have started to fall back.”

Paul Hollingsworth, a UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said this pattern supported a view that the struggling pound had fed through faster than expected, rather than by a larger amount.

“The effects of the lower pound already appear to be fading at the start of the production pipeline,” he said.

“Of course, it takes time for rises in producer prices to feed through to prices in the shops, and as a result, we think that CPI inflation will rise a bit further in the second half of the year, peaking at about 3.2% in the fourth quarter. But inflation is likely to drop back quickly in 2018 as the impact of the lower pound begins to fade.”

The pensions minister is facing criticism after suggesting that millions of women in their 60s who are facing cuts to their state pension could take up apprenticeships as a route to re-employment.

Guy Opperman said the government would not change laws that have disadvantaged older women, but instead highlighted “extended apprenticeship opportunities” to get older people into work.



His comments, which were met with cries of “shame”, came at a meeting in Westminster Hall at which fellow Conservatives and members of the Democratic Unionist Party were among dozens of MPs saying that the changes were unfair.



The debate centred on the plight of the so-called Waspi women – Women Against State Pension Inequality – whose aim is to achieve fair transitional arrangements for women born in the 1950s, for whom the state pension age is being raised from 60 to 66 by 2020.



Opperman said the government would not offer concessions and instead suggested that older people could retrain, go back to work or take up an apprenticeship.



“There is a massive amount that this government has done on a progressive basis to get people back into employment in their pre-pension years.

“We have created and extended a network of older people’s champions into all 34 Jobcentre Plus districts in the country.

“We have committed to lifelong learning – over 200,000 over 60 have entered further education.

“Thirdly, we have also extended apprenticeship opportunities as one of the best routes to skilled employment for people of all ages and gender. Such apprenticeships in England for example in 2014/15 are 12% of the starting apprenticeships are for those over 45,” he said.

Graham Jones, the Labour MP for Hyndburn, raised a point of order following Opperman’s comment.

“I’m struggling to hear the debate, did the minister just say that women aged 64 could go on an apprenticeship course?” he said.

Campaigners for Waspi women took to Twitter to express their anger at Opperman’s comments. Diana Mitchell Launt wrote: “I don’t want an apprenticeship: I’ve studied enough. ILM Level 3 in Management, NHS M & H trainer. H & S. Want my pension. 45 yrs NI.

“I care for my partner who has severe heart failure. At 60 I would be gutted that I would be stealing an apprentice ship from young.”



Another, Carol Billett, tweeted: “So maybe us Waspi Campaign women can all be become sorcerers apprentices and magic a pension! Guy Opperman, you’re a disgrace!”



Mhairi Black, the SNP’s pensions spokesperson, told MPs that if the Conservatives could find £1bn to strike a deal with the DUP, they could afford to give women the pensions they are due.



“For the government to say they can’t afford to pay these women what they are owed is laughable.

“These women have had the misfortune of being female and being born in the 1950s and live under this UK government, which refuses to do the right thing.

“This is an issue of equality. The UK government must take responsibility and do the right thing for these women who are missing out on their pension,” she said.

Labour’s Caroline Harris said the government “has betrayed these women – they’ve stolen their security and they’ve shattered their dreams without time to prepare and make the necessary alternative arrangements”.



Conservative MP Keith Simpson said his own wife was affected by the changes. “She feels incandescent with rage. She had no correspondence whatsoever,” he said. Another Conservative, former children’s minister Tim Loughton, described the changes as an “injustice” and “unfair burden” made worse by “poor communications” from the government.

Sammy Wilson, a DUP MP, said his party would use its “influence, however minimal or maximum”, to push the government into changing the policy.

Fans pay tribute to popular children’s television performer who created green witch character with Rod Hull in the 1980s

The children’s television actor Carol Lee Scott, best known as Grotbags the witch, has died aged 74.

The entertainer appeared in several children’s programmes in the 1980s and early 1990s, including the Rod Hull hit Emu’s World.

Scott’s death was announced by relatives on social media, prompting an outpouring of nostalgic tributes by fans.

Among those remembering the performer was comedian Rufus Hound, who said she was “an icon for folk of my generation”.

Many warmly remembered Scott’s Grotbags character, with one fan tweeting: “Rest in peace grotbags, another part of my childhood heaven bound.”

The Somerset-born actor’s early career saw stints as a cabaret performer touring clubs in the north of England. She worked as a London pub singer and as a Blue Coat at holiday camp Pontins.

She spent 19 years working for the holiday park company before collaborating with Hull in the 1980s.

The pair created Grotbags while performing a summer season in Cleethorpes, with the character first appearing in Emu’s World in the 1980s before going it alone.

Also starring puppeteer Richard Coombs, Grotbags ran on ITV for three series between 1991 and 1993, with each episode following the antics of the green witch and her minions at her Gloomy Fortress. Scott and Hull remained friends until his death in 1999.

Scott’s niece Gina Mear wrote on Facebook on Wednesday: “My dear aunty Carol lost her brave fight against cancer yesterday. To many of you she was Grotbags – a legend! To me she was just aunty Carol. I shall miss her hugely, rest in peace Carol.”

I was sceptical about Manchester’s new hire bikes, fearing they would all end up at the bottom of the Ship Canal.

Yet just a week after Chinese firm Mobike plonked 1,000 silver and orange two-wheelers on the streets of Manchester and Salford, I’m already a convert. Yes, there have been a few glitches with the app (you’re supposed to be able to reserve a bike for 15 minutes but I haven’t been able to for a few days), and I’ve no idea what those messages say that they’ve sent me in Chinese. But Mobikes are significantly better than London’s hire bikes, or any I’ve tried in other cities across the world. Here’s why:

1 You can leave them anywhere

There are no docking stations, so you can just park your Mobike at your destination, whether that’s outside your house, the pub, the cinema, the station. The other day I merrily left one in the Northern Quarter, a part of the city I have avoided by bike since mine got stolen there earlier in the year. In London I’ve had many infuriating experiences — notably, cycling to Euston on a Boris Bike to catch a train, only to discover the nearest docking station (which is still five minutes walk away from the platforms) is full. Not a problem with Mobikes. You can leave them anywhere within the boundaries of Manchester and Salford, as long as you park them somewhere public that doesn’t obstruct the road or pavement.

2 They’re cheap

At 50p per half hour, the pricing is low enough that you feel it’s worth a quick spin, even just a five-minute ride that would have taken 20 to walk. In London, it costs £2 for a day pass, which allows unlimited rides of 30 minutes or less. But often when I’m down in the capital I just want to do one quick ride, and £2 feels a bit much, when it’s only £1.50 to take the bus. It’s significantly more expensive in other cities: a 24-hour pass for a B-bike in Austin, Texas, costs $12 (£9.30). A Vélib in Paris is €1.70 (£1.50).

3 They’re fun to ride

Yes, the single gear is pretty low, so you’ll be pedalling like billy-o if you’re in a rush. And the airless tyres do make for a slightly bone-shaking ride, especially on cobbles. But they’re much nippier than the London tanks, and lighter too. The jury is out on whether they really are indestructible, as the designers claim. There are doubtless some Manc reprobates who will do their best to prove the Chinese wrong.

4 The system rewards good behaviour

It remains to be seen whether the fleet will all get trashed or nicked, but built into Mobike’s operation is a points system which rewards chivalry and punishes selfishness and anti social behaviour. All users start with 100 credits. If you end up on zero you are barred from using the bikes. Being a tell-tale pays. If you dob someone in for parking “wrongly” (ie in the middle of the road or in their front garden, like this one I spotted in Old Trafford), you get an extra credit. You lose 20 credits if you park it somewhere inaccessible to the public, 15 if you forget to lock it, 100 if you abandon one after being stopped by the police. Attach your own personal lock or break the law on one and you’ll be on a big fat zero. In future, you may be able to earn free rides if you spot a bike parked somewhere silly and ride it back into the centre of town.

5 They aren’t a massive drain on public funds

Don’t get me wrong, I am all for diverting a lot more of the transport budget towards cycling. But the London scheme has cost £60m of public money since it launched in 2010, and is still subsidised to the tune of £3.6m each year. Mobike costs Manchester and Salford city councils diddly squat. They hope the bikes will save them money, because Mobike has promised to share with them data showing where the bikes are most commonly ridden, which should help them plan future cycle infrastructure. On which note: please sort out the canal and Irwell-side routes, Transport for Greater Manchester. Last night I really struggled to lug a Mobike up the steps to Regent Road when the riverside bike route suddenly stopped.

Of course, they are not perfect. If Mobike are reading this please consider:

When China’s biggest public bike-hire operator chose Manchester as the location for their first smart scheme outside Asia, they were cautioned that the weather on the banks of the Irwell differed a little from the Yangtze.

“Everyone warned us about the rain,” said Richard Huang, head of international product at Mobike. He was sheltering under an alcove outside Marks & Spencer on Thursday morning as 1,000 of his silver and orange babies were released into the pot-holed streets of the sodden Cottonopolis for 50p a go.

We wanted a city that would be the most open-minded to work with, and everyone said Manchester Chris Martin, Mobike

To simulate a Mancunian puddle, his team took the bikes to a river in China. They turned the pedals in the water to spin the back wheel, checking the minimalist mudguards would block the spray and spare users a soggy bottom. They do, according to early adopters braving weather described by Manchester councillor Pat Karney as “double-minging – not just rainy but cold, too”.

The bikes are built to last four years with no maintenance, with shaft-driven single-speed transmission hidden inside the bike to turn the wheels instead of a mucky old chain; airless tyres that never get punctures; and wheels made out of aluminium magnesium alloy, which are indestructible even with a hammer, according to Steve Pyer, Mobike’s UK general manager.

Described as the world’s first cashless and station-free bike-sharing platform, Mobike launched in Shanghai in April 2016 and has expanded to 99 cities across Asia. Five million Mobikes are in circulation, and the company claims to be able to manufacture 100,000 more every day.

'Uber for bikes': Chinese firm eyes global dominion with launch in Manchester Read more

An “Uber for bikes”, the company does not rely on fixed docking stations like more established schemes in London and Paris, instead trusting users to park them wherever they like within the city boundaries of Manchester and Salford.

Huang is optimistic that the Mobikes won’t all get stolen, pointing out the parts are all custom designed and can only be dismantled with custom tools. He hopes they won’t end up at the bottom of the Irwell or the Ship Canal either: the app riders use to unlock and pay for the bikes tracks where they end up, and there are fines and bans for those who dump them somewhere stupid. They are also fitted with alarms that sound if someone tries to break the wheel lock.

The firm chose Manchester for its first non-Asian launch because of the city’s reputation for innovation, said Chris Martin, Mobike’s head of international expansion. “We wanted to find a city that would be the fastest and most open-minded to work with, and everyone said Manchester.”

The company had its first meetings with Manchester city council in March, successfully persuading officials that inviting Mobike in was a win-win situation. Unlike the London scheme, which has cost taxpayers over £60m since its launch in 2010 and is still subsidised by £3.6m each year, Mobike costs nothing to the public purse.

That’s partly why Manchester, along with its neighbouring city of Salford, thought it would give it a go, said Karney. Plus there was a chance to beat London. “This is the start of Manchester becoming the UK’s cycling capital. We are never modest in our ambitions here,” said the councillor.

It is certainly an ambitious idea in an area which just this week was declared one of the unhealthiest in England, and which is home to the only drive-through branch of Greggs.

The bikes received a warm welcome despite the June gloom. “Getting more people on bikes who don’t normally ride bikes is a brilliant idea,” said Stuart Round, 38. But he admitted he doesn’t dare ride around town. “I’ve never rode my bike in the city centre, because I think it’s probably a death trap if I’m being honest with you. I think the infrastructure is the key thing. And I can’t see why the two [bikes and roads] can’t go hand-in-hand.”

Rob Raikes, 72, from the Greater Manchester Cycling Campaign, said he thought the idea was “wonderful” and hoped it would encourage the council to invest in making cycling safer. “If you suddenly have a thousand inexperienced cyclists in the middle of Manchester there’s going to be one hulluva duty to make the city streets safer. People will be terrified. Hopefully this scheme will be a pump primer for making cycling infrastructure in the city much better.”

John Brown, 58, said he would like more segregated bike lanes, but loved the idea of the hire bikes. They’re good value for money, he said: “50p for 30 mins – for a pound you can be at work and fit, so happy days. Your wife might fancy you more.”

How it works

Find yourself in the red every month? Can’t seem to budget responsibly? Chip could be for you – if you don’t mind it snooping around your bank account

A robot banker who can pull you out of your overdraft sounds like the premise of a – dull, admittedly – sci-fi story, but Chip promises that it’s here right now.

Just finishing its first year in existence, the start-up has a compelling pitch: plug it in to your bank account, and it will analyse your spending, moving money you don’t need into a savings account, and slowly helping you hit financial security.

But even the best technology can’t overcome the iron law of budgeting. There are ultimately only two ways to fix your finances: spend less, or earn more. So which does Chip do? And how much does it actually help?

Simon Rabin, Chip’s chief executive and co-founder, says that the company’s goal is to “help people spend their money in a better way”.

“Younger people find it notoriously difficult to focus their spending on the things they care about,” he says. If you ask a typical millennial – Rabin, who is 30, includes himself in this – what they want to use their disposable income for, they’ll say holidays, deposit for a home, a new wardrobe, and so on.

“But if you exported your bank statements and went through it, you’d see you’re not focusing your spending on those things,” Rabin says. “And you’ll probably focus it more towards stuff you wish you weren’t.”

Chip’s solution is to peer over your digital shoulder at your bank balance, and when it’s looking particularly full – shortly after payday, or when you haven’t been out for a while – siphon a small amount off into a separate savings account. Over time, that savings account swells, and, hopefully, you don’t notice the difference to your current account.

Spending a little less but without having to think about it

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Chip in action. Photograph: Chip

Of course, the money still comes from somewhere. In practice, one of two things will happen: either you’ll carry on spending the same as you did before, and your savings account will grow at the same rate as your overdraft; or Chip’s model will work for you, and you’ll begin to spend less without really thinking about it.

You’ll scrape the bottom of your bank account slightly earlier each month than you would have done otherwise, and the slight sense of panic at running out of money will force you to cut down on spending. At least, until payday.

It’s not a system that will work for everybody. For one thing, your outgoings need to be flexible enough that cutting down on them is actually possible: if your extra few days scraping the bottom of your account means you don’t go out to the pub, fine; if it means you don’t eat, that’s less helpful.

For another, you need to be just the right sort of irrational: bad enough at financial restraint that simply making a budget and sticking to it hasn’t worked, but good enough at it that when you do run out of money in a given month you don’t just transfer money back out of the Chip savings account and carry on partying.

But for 10s of thousands of people, it does work. “It’s all about using technology to make better decisions, rather than using technology to give you the discipline to make the decisions yourself,” says Rabin. “It’s not necessary. The technology can make the decisions for you.”

Getting people out of their overdraft

Rabin says the average Chip user is around 29, with £2,000 a month net income – well above the median, particularly if they’re graduates with student loans, and so the sort of people for whom financial security is tantalisingly within reach.

And yet their spending habits are atrocious: the typical Chip user spends a third of the month in their overdraft, every month, constantly fluctuating between feeling moderately well-off and unable to make ends meet.

Those users, who are throwing upwards of 100 pounds a year at a problem which is so easily solvable, also provide the wider motivation behind Chip, as well as a guide to the service’s future growth: Rabin wants to destroy the overdraft.

“The first big problem for us to solve with this is pulling people out of this overdraft behaviour, and help them live their lives in the black,” he says. “Overdrafts are the sleeping dragon of the British banking industry: 40% of Brits use their overdraft every month, 20% are perpetually in them.

“It’s the crack cocaine model. You go to university, you get a free overdraft, and you keep it once you’re a graduate … then, suddenly, you’re 25, and there’s a pound a day charge, a 15% APR, and a fee every time you hit the bottom. It’s funny, there’s such outrage about the payday loan industry and high APR credit cards, but overdrafts – no one’s really woken up to them.”

For Chip users, the battle to leave their overdraft is such that they even pushed the company to institute a feature which, on the face of it, makes no sense: the option to carry on saving while they’re in their overdraft.

At first glance, borrowing money to put it in a savings account with a worse rate of interest is … not great financial planning. But it works: those savers who swing between feast and famine save more, quicker, if they carry on stashing away cash even when they’re technically overdrawn. And then, when they’ve saved a month’s salary, they can transfer it back all in one go and be free.

For those who can’t quite stomach that tier of irrationality, Chip is also working on another solution due to arrive this month: a different form of overdraft. The company will offer users “Smart Credit”, transferring £100 into their accounts just before they would otherwise hit their overdraft. “The average rate for an £800 overdraft is 37% APR, which is outrageous. We want to protect our customers from that and charge them half the price.”

There’s a chance such a move could leave a sour taste in the mouth – replacing a bad thing with a slightly less bad thing – but for now, Chip’s users are evangelical (although a £10 referral reward probably doesn’t hurt matters). “I saved £108 in a month that I otherwise wouldn’t have, and didn’t go overdrawn,” said one user, Joe Lane. “I think it’s great.”

I’d like to use it myself, but I’m one of the weird millennials Rabin can’t understand, who actually does a budget and sticks to it, saving cash the old fashioned way. “I tried that,” he said. “I couldn’t be arsed to put in the time, effort and energy … I don’t think the other products solved the problem for me.

“I don’t want to look at a pie chart showing that I’ve spent 20% of my money on going out this month. I want it done for me.”

There have been times in my reporting from disaster zones when I have had the unsettling feeling that I was seeing not just a crisis in the here and now, but getting a glimpse of the future – a preview of where the road we are all on is headed, unless we somehow grab the wheel and swerve. When I listen to Donald Trump speak, with his obvious relish in creating an atmosphere of chaos and destabilisation, I often think: I’ve seen this before, in those strange moments when portals seemed to open up into our collective future.

One of those moments arrived in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, as I watched hordes of private military contractors descend on the flooded city to find ways to profit from the disaster, even as thousands of the city’s residents, abandoned by their government, were treated like dangerous criminals just for trying to survive.

I started to notice the same tactics in disaster zones around the world. I used the term “shock doctrine” to describe the brutal tactic of using the public’s disorientation following a collective shock – wars, coups, terrorist attacks, market crashes or natural disasters – to push through radical pro-corporate measures, often called “shock therapy”. Though Trump breaks the mould in some ways, his shock tactics do follow a script, and one that is familiar from other countries that have had rapid changes imposed under the cover of crisis.

This strategy has been a silent partner to the imposition of neoliberalism for more than 40 years. Shock tactics follow a clear pattern: wait for a crisis (or even, in some instances, as in Chile or Russia, help foment one), declare a moment of what is sometimes called “extraordinary politics”, suspend some or all democratic norms – and then ram the corporate wishlist through as quickly as possible. The research showed that virtually any tumultuous situation, if framed with sufficient hysteria by political leaders, could serve this softening-up function. It could be an event as radical as a military coup, but the economic shock of a market or budget crisis would also do the trick. Amid hyperinflation or a banking collapse, for instance, the country’s governing elites were frequently able to sell a panicked population on the necessity for attacks on social protections, or enormous bailouts to prop up the financial private sector – because the alternative, they claimed, was outright economic apocalypse.

The Republicans under Donald Trump are already seizing the atmosphere of constant crisis that surrounds this presidency to push through as many unpopular, pro-corporate policies. And we know they would move much further and faster given an even bigger external shock. We know this because senior members of Trump’s team have been at the heart of some of the most egregious examples of the shock doctrine in recent memory.

Rex Tillerson, the US secretary of state, has built his career in large part around taking advantage of the profitability of war and instability. ExxonMobil profited more than any oil major from the increase in the price of oil that was the result of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. It also directly exploited the Iraq war to defy US state department advice and make an exploration deal in Iraqi Kurdistan, a move that, because it sidelined Iraq’s central government, could well have sparked a full-blown civil war, and certainly did contribute to internal conflict.

As CEO of ExxonMobil, Tillerson profited from disaster in other ways as well. As an executive at the fossil fuel giant, he spent his career working for a company that, despite its own scientists’ research into the reality of human-caused climate change, decided to fund and spread misinformation and junk climate science. All the while, according to an LA Times investigation, ExxonMobil (both before and after Exxon and Mobil merged) worked diligently to figure out how to further profit from and protect itself against the very crisis on which it was casting doubt. It did so by exploring drilling in the Arctic (which was melting, thanks to climate change), redesigning a natural gas pipeline in the North Sea to accommodate rising sea levels and supercharged storms, and doing the same for a new rig off the coast of Nova Scotia.

At a public event in 2012, Tillerson acknowledged that climate change was happening – but what he said next was revealing: “as a species”, humans have always adapted. “So we will adapt to this. Changes to weather patterns that move crop production areas around – we’ll adapt to that.”

He’s quite right: humans do adapt when their land ceases to produce food. The way humans adapt is by moving. They leave their homes and look for places to live where they can feed themselves and their families. But, as Tillerson well knows, we do not live at a time when countries gladly open their borders to hungry and desperate people. In fact, he now works for a president who has painted refugees from Syria – a country where drought was an accelerant of the tensions that led to civil war – as Trojan horses for terrorism. A president who introduced a travel ban that has gone a long way towards barring Syrian migrants from entering the United States.

A president who has said about Syrian children seeking asylum, “I can look in their faces and say: ‘You can’t come.’” A president who has not budged from that position even after he ordered missile strikes on Syria, supposedly moved by the horrifying impacts of a chemical weapon attack on Syrian children and “beautiful babies”. (But not moved enough to welcome them and their parents.) A president who has announced plans to turn the tracking, surveillance, incarceration and deportation of immigrants into a defining feature of his administration.

Waiting in the wings, biding their time, are plenty of other members of the Trump team who have deep skills in profiting from all of that.

Between election day and the end of Trump’s first month in office, the stocks of the two largest private prison companies in the US, CoreCivic (formerly the Corrections Corporation of America) and the Geo Group, doubled, soaring by 140% and 98%, respectively. And why not? Just as Exxon learned to profit from climate change, these companies are part of the sprawling industry of private prisons, private security and private surveillance that sees wars and migration – both very often linked to climate stresses – as exciting and expanding market opportunities. In the US, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (Ice) incarcerates up to 34,000 immigrants thought to be in the country illegally on any given day, and 73% of them are held in private prisons. Little wonder, then, that these companies’ stocks soared on Trump’s election. And soon they had even more reasons to celebrate: one of the first things Trump’s new attorney general, Jeff Sessions, did was rescind the Obama administration’s decision to move away from for-profit jails for the general prison population.

Trump appointed as deputy defence secretary Patrick Shanahan, a top executive at Boeing who, at one point, was responsible for selling costly hardware to the US military, including Apache and Chinook helicopters. He also oversaw Boeing’s ballistic missile defence programme – a part of the operation that stands to profit enormously if international tensions continue to escalate under Trump.

And this is part of a much larger trend. As Lee Fang reported in the Intercept in March 2017, “President Donald Trump has weaponised the revolving door by appointing defence contractors and lobbyists to key government positions as he seeks to rapidly expand the military budget and homeland security programmes … At least 15 officials with financial ties to defence contractors have been either nominated or appointed so far.”

The revolving door is nothing new, of course. Retired military brass reliably take up jobs and contracts with weapons companies. What’s new is the number of generals with lucrative ties to military contractors whom Trump has appointed to cabinet posts with the power to allocate funds – including those stemming from his plan to increase spending on the military, the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security by more than $80bn in just one year.

The other thing that has changed is the size of the Homeland Security and surveillance industry. This sector grew exponentially after the September 11 attacks, when the Bush administration announced it was embarking on a never-ending “war on terror”, and that everything that could be outsourced would be. New firms with tinted windows sprouted up like malevolent mushrooms around suburban Virginia, outside Washington DC, and existing ones, such as Booz Allen Hamilton, expanded into brand new territories. Writing in Slate in 2005, Daniel Gross captured the mood of what many called the security bubble: “Homeland security may have just reached the stage that internet investing hit in 1997. Back then, all you needed to do was put an ‘e’ in front of your company name and your IPO would rocket. Now you can do the same with ‘fortress’.”

That means many of Trump’s appointees come from firms that specialise in functions that, not so long ago, it would have been unthinkable to outsource. His National Security Council chief of staff, for instance, is retired Lt Gen Keith Kellogg. Among the many jobs Kellogg has had with security contractors since going private was one with Cubic Defense.

According to the company, he led “our ground combat training business and focus[ed] on expanding the company’s worldwide customer base”. If you think “combat training” is something armies used to do all on their own, you’d be right.

One noticeable thing about Trump’s contractor appointees is how many of them come from firms that did not even exist before 9/11: L-1 Identity Solutions (specialising in biometrics), the Chertoff Group (founded by George W Bush’s homeland security director Michael Chertoff), Palantir Technologies (a surveillance/big data firm cofounded by PayPal billionaire and Trump backer Peter Thiel), and many more. Security firms draw heavily on the military and intelligence wings of government for their staffing.

Under Trump, lobbyists and staffers from these firms are now migrating back to government, where they will very likely push for even more opportunities to monetise the hunt for people Trump likes to call “bad hombres”.

This creates a disastrous cocktail. Take a group of people who directly profit from ongoing war and then put those same people at the heart of government. Who’s going to make the case for peace? Indeed, the idea that a war could ever definitively end seems a quaint relic of what during the Bush years was dismissed as “pre–September 11 thinking”.

And then there’s vice-president Mike Pence, seen by many as the grownup in Trump’s messy room. Yet it is Pence, the former governor of Indiana, who actually has the most disturbing track record when it comes to bloody-minded exploitation of human suffering.

When Mike Pence was announced as Donald Trump’s running mate, I thought to myself: I know that name, I’ve seen it somewhere. And then I remembered. He was at the heart of one of the most shocking stories I’ve ever covered: the disaster capitalism free-for-all that followed Katrina and the drowning of New Orleans. Mike Pence’s doings as a profiteer from human suffering are so appalling that they are worth exploring in a little more depth, since they tell us a great deal about what we can expect from this administration during times of heightened crisis.

Before we delve into Pence’s role, what’s important to remember about Hurricane Katrina is that, though it is usually described as a “natural disaster”, there was nothing natural about the way it affected the city of New Orleans. When Katrina hit the coast of Mississippi in August 2005, it had been downgraded from a category 5 to a still-devastating category 3 hurricane. But by the time it made its way to New Orleans, it had lost most of its strength and been downgraded again, to a “tropical storm”.

That’s relevant, because a tropical storm should never have broken through New Orleans’s flood defence. Katrina did break through, however, because the levees that protect the city did not hold. Why? We now know that despite repeated warnings about the risk, the army corps of engineers had allowed the levees to fall into a state of disrepair. That failure was the result of two main factors.

One was a specific disregard for the lives of poor black people, whose homes in the Lower Ninth Ward were left most vulnerable by the failure to fix the levees. This was part of a wider neglect of public infrastructure, which is the direct result of decades of neoliberal policy. Because when you systematically wage war on the very idea of the public sphere and the public good, of course the publicly owned bones of society – roads, bridges, levees, water systems – are going to slip into a state of such disrepair that it takes little to push them beyond the breaking point. When you massively cut taxes so that you don’t have money to spend on much of anything besides the police and the military, this is what happens.

It wasn’t just the physical infrastructure that failed the city, and particularly its poorest residents, who are, as in so many US cities, overwhelmingly African American. The human systems of disaster response also failed – the second great fracturing. The arm of the federal government that is tasked with responding to moments of national crisis such as this is the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), with state and municipal governments also playing key roles in evacuation planning and response. All levels of government failed.

It took Fema five days to get water and food to people in New Orleans who had sought emergency shelter in the Superdome. The most harrowing images from that time were of people stranded on rooftops – of homes and hospitals – holding up signs that said “HELP”, watching the helicopters pass them by. People helped each other as best they could. They rescued each other in canoes and rowboats. They fed each other. They displayed that beautiful human capacity for solidarity that moments of crisis so often intensify. But at the official level, it was the complete opposite. I’ll always remember the words of Curtis Muhammad, a longtime New Orleans civil rights organiser, who said this experience “convinced us that we had no caretakers”.

The way this abandonment played out was deeply unequal, and the divisions cleaved along lines of race and class. Many people were able to leave the city on their own – they got into their cars, drove to a dry hotel, called their insurance brokers. Some people stayed because they believed the storm defences would hold. But a great many others stayed because they had no choice – they didn’t have a car, or were too infirm to drive, or simply didn’t know what to do. Those are the people who needed a functioning system of evacuation and relief – and they were out of luck.

Abandoned in the city without food or water, those in need did what anyone would do in those circumstances: they took provisions from local stores. Fox News and other media outlets seized on this to paint New Orleans’s black residents as dangerous “looters” who would soon be coming to invade the dry, white parts of the city and surrounding suburbs and towns. Buildings were spray-painted with messages: “Looters will be shot.”

Checkpoints were set up to trap people in the flooded parts of town. On Danziger Bridge, police officers shot black residents on sight (five of the officers involved ultimately pleaded guilty, and the city came to a $13.3m settlement with the families in that case and two other similar post-Katrina cases). Meanwhile, gangs of armed white vigilantes prowled the streets looking, as one resident later put it in an exposé by investigative journalist AC Thompson, for “the opportunity to hunt black people”.

I was in New Orleans during the flooding and I saw for myself how amped up the police and military were – not to mention private security guards from companies such as Blackwater who were showing up fresh from Iraq. It felt very much like a war zone, with poor and black people in the crosshairs – people whose only crime was trying to survive. By the time the National Guard arrived to organise a full evacuation of the city, it was done with a level of aggression and ruthlessness that was hard to fathom. Soldiers pointed machine guns at residents as they boarded buses, providing no information about where they were being taken. Children were often separated from their parents.

What I saw during the flooding shocked me. But what I saw in the aftermath of Katrina shocked me even more. With the city reeling, and with its residents dispersed across the country and unable to protect their own interests, a plan emerged to ram through a pro-corporate wishlist with maximum velocity. The famed free-market economist Milton Friedman, then 93 years old, wrote an article for the Wall Street Journal stating, “Most New Orleans schools are in ruins, as are the homes of the children who have attended them. The children are now scattered all over the country. This is a tragedy. It is also an opportunity to radically reform the educational system.”

In a similar vein, Richard Baker, at that time a Republican congressman from Louisiana, declared, “We finally cleaned up public housing in New Orleans. We couldn’t do it, but God did.” I was in an evacuation shelter near Baton Rouge when Baker made that statement. The people I spoke with were just floored by it. Imagine being forced to leave your home, having to sleep in a camping bed in some cavernous convention centre, and then finding out that the people who are supposed to represent you are claiming this was some sort of divine intervention – God apparently really likes condo developments.

Baker got his “cleanup” of public housing. In the months after the storm, with New Orleans’s residents – and all their inconvenient opinions, rich culture and deep attachments – out of the way, thousands of public housing units, many of which had sustained minimal storm damage because they were on high ground, were demolished. They were replaced with condos and town houses priced far out of reach for most who had lived there.

And this is where Mike Pence enters the story. At the time Katrina hit New Orleans, Pence was chairman of the powerful and highly ideological Republican Study Committee (RSC), a caucus of conservative lawmakers. On 13 September 2005 – just 15 days after the levees were breached, and with parts of New Orleans still under water – the RSC convened a fateful meeting at the offices of the Heritage Foundation in Washington DC. Under Pence’s leadership, the group came up with a list of “Pro-Free-Market Ideas for Responding to Hurricane Katrina and High Gas Prices” – 32 pseudo-relief policies in all, each one straight out of the disaster capitalism playbook.

What stands out is the commitment to wage all-out war on labour standards and the public sphere – which is bitterly ironic, because the failure of public infrastructure is what turned Katrina into a human catastrophe in the first place. Also notable is the determination to use any opportunity to strengthen the hand of the oil and gas industry. The list includes recommendations to suspend the obligation for federal contractors to pay a living wage; make the entire affected area a free-enterprise zone; and “repeal or waive restrictive environmental regulations … that hamper rebuilding”. In other words, a war on the kind of red tape designed to keep communities safe from harm.

President Bush adopted many of the recommendations within the week, although, under pressure, he was eventually forced to reinstate the labour standards. Another recommendation called for giving parents vouchers to use at private and charter schools (for-profit schools subsidised with tax dollars), a move perfectly in line with the vision held by Trump’s pick for education secretary, Betsy DeVos. Within the year, the New Orleans school system became the most privatised in the US.

And there was more. Though climate scientists have directly linked the increased intensity of hurricanes to warming ocean temperatures, that didn’t stop Pence and his committee from calling on Congress to repeal environmental regulations on the Gulf coast, give permission for new oil refineries in the US, and green-light “drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge”.

It’s a kind of madness. After all, these very measures are a surefire way to drive up greenhouse gas emissions, the major human contributor to climate change, which leads to fiercer storms. Yet they were immediately championed by Pence, and later adopted by Bush, under the guise of responding to a devastating hurricane.

It’s worth pausing to tease out the implications of all of this. Hurricane Katrina turned into a catastrophe in New Orleans because of a combination of extremely heavy weather – possibly linked to climate change – and weak and neglected public infrastructure. The so-called solutions proposed by the group Pence headed at the time were the very things that would inevitably exacerbate climate change and weaken public infrastructure even further. He and his fellow “free-market” travellers were determined, it seems, to do the very things that are guaranteed to lead to more Katrinas in the future.

And now Mike Pence is in a position to bring this vision to the entire United States.

The oil industry wasn’t the only one to profit from Hurricane Katrina. Immediately after the storm, the whole gang of contractors who had descended on Baghdad when war broke out – Bechtel, Fluor, Halliburton, Blackwater, CH2M Hill and Parsons, infamous for its sloppy Iraq work – now arrived in New Orleans. They had a singular vision: to prove that the kinds of privatised services they had been providing in Iraq and Afghanistan also had an ongoing domestic market – and to collect no-bid contracts totalling $3.4bn.

The controversies were legion. Relevant experience often appeared to have nothing to do with how contracts were allocated. Take, for example, the company that Fema paid $5.2m to perform the crucial role of building a base camp for emergency workers in St Bernard Parish, a suburb of New Orleans. The camp construction fell behind schedule and was never completed. Under investigation, it emerged that the contractor, Lighthouse Disaster Relief, was in fact a religious group. “About the closest thing I have done to this is just organise a youth camp with my church,” confessed Lighthouse’s director, Pastor Gary Heldreth.

After all the layers of subcontractors had taken their cut, there was next to nothing left for the people doing the work. Author Mike Davis tracked the way Fema paid Shaw $175 per sq ft to install blue tarps on damaged roofs, even though the tarps themselves were provided by the government. Once all the subcontractors took their share, the workers who actually hammered in the tarps were paid as little as $2 per sq ft.

“Every level of the contracting food chain, in other words, is grotesquely overfed except the bottom rung,” Davis wrote, “where the actual work is carried out.” These supposed “contractors” were really – like the Trump Organization – hollow brands, sucking out profit and then slapping their name on cheap or non-existent services.

In order to offset the tens of billions going to private companies in contracts and tax breaks, in November 2005 the Republican-controlled Congress announced that it needed to cut $40bn from the federal budget. Among the programmes that were slashed: student loans, Medicaid and food stamps.

So, the poorest people in the US subsidised the contractor bonanza twice: first, when Katrina relief morphed into unregulated corporate handouts, providing neither decent jobs nor functional public services; and second, when the few programmes that assist the unemployed and working poor nationwide were gutted to pay those bloated bills.

New Orleans is the disaster capitalism blueprint – designed by the current vice-president and by the Heritage Foundation, the hard-right think tank to which Trump has outsourced much of his administration’s budgeting. Ultimately, the response to Katrina sparked an approval ratings freefall for George W Bush, a plunge that eventually lost the Republicans the presidency in 2008. Nine years later, with Republicans now in control of Congress and the White House, it’s not hard to imagine this test case for privatised disaster response being adopted on a national scale.

The presence of highly militarised police and armed private soldiers in New Orleans came as a surprise to many. Since then, the phenomenon has expanded exponentially, with local police forces across the country outfitted to the gills with military-grade gear, including tanks and drones, and private security companies frequently providing training and support. Given the array of private military and security contractors occupying key positions in the Trump administration, we can expect all of this to expand further with each new shock.

The Katrina experience also stands as a stark warning to those who are holding out hope for Trump’s promised $1tn in infrastructure spending. That spending will fix some roads and bridges, and it will create jobs. Crucially, Trump has indicated that he plans to do as much as possible not through the public sector but through public-private partnerships – which have a terrible track record for corruption, and may result in far lower wages than true public-works projects would. Given Trump’s business record, and Pence’s role in the administration, there is every reason to fear that his big-ticket infrastructure spending could become a Katrina-like kleptocracy, a government of thieves, with the Mar-a-Lago set helping themselves to vast sums of taxpayer money.

New Orleans provides a harrowing picture of what we can expect when the next shock hits. But sadly, it is far from complete: there is much more that this administration might try to push through under cover of crisis. To become shock-resistant, we need to prepare for that, too.

The annual Running of the Bulls festival brought Pamplona world fame, but has become tainted by animal rights abuses and reports of sexual assault

Hordes of people will descend on Pamplona this week for the annual Running of the Bulls festival. The city in the northern Spanish region of Navarre will be caught in collective ecstasy as the six bulls and six steers race through the narrow streets as part of a historic tradition first documented in the 14th century.

Red handkerchiefs at the ready, Pamplona has been gearing up for the world-famous event which drew 1.5 million visitors last year.

But the festival is also at the centre of multiple controversies. Last year, it made headlines over reports of sexual violence when police arrested 16 men in relation to five violent attacks, including a rape, and 11 allegations of sexual assault.

The event, known as the festival of San Fermín, also brings ongoing criticism from animal rights activists. Each year anti-bullfighting protests have been held on the eve of the event, decrying the closing ritual in which the bulls are fought and killed by a matador in the historic bullring.

Beyond the bulls, the festivity is also a communal celebration of excess and fun that encompasses and paralyses the entire city for nine days. In fact, unless you or your relative owns a flat with a balcony somewhere along the 825 metre run, you’re better off watching the race on TV.

As far as Pamplona’s residents are concerned, “the days before San Fermín feel like the world is going to end”, says Zurine Altable who lives in the city. “During Sanfermínes you can see almost everything – from someone sleeping standing up while a txaranga (a local band) plays in their ear, to someone literally ripping off the toilet from your bar, to someone pissing on the actual bar, which has happened to me while working.”

The city in numbers …

16,448 people took part in last year’s running of the bulls’ corridas (the race itself).

46% of visitors took part in the corridas for the first time in 2016. Most of them were Australian, British and American. According to a survey, 82% of the runners said they knew the drill – so they had a good night’s sleep the night before the early morning event, knew the rules and were aware they could die. The French participants seemed to be the most reckless, with 33% of participants running without having slept the night before.

92% of runners are men.

500 – the minimum price in euros of a bedroom in the famous hotel where Hemingway used to stay during the festival.

… and pictures

Pamplona in sound and vision

To get a true sense of the city’s glory, you need to read the Pamplona depicted in literature. The Sun Also Rises (translated into Spanish as “Fiesta”, which is said to be the name Hemingway originally gave it) is where the author first displayed his infatuation with the city, helping to create the image that endures to this day, 91 years after the book was published. Shakespeare also set his eye on the kingdom of Navarre, of which Pamplona is the capital; he said the region would be “the wonder of the world” in his comedy Love’s Labour’s Lost.

The most memorable cinematic rendering of Pamplona is, inevitably, in the film adaptation of the Hemingway novel released in 1957 starring Ava Gardner, and it also appears in Orson Welles’s unfinished 1992 film Don Quixote, in which Sancho Panza is seen attending a bull run.

History in 100 words

Pamplona lies in a vast valley inhabited by humans for at least 75,000 years. It is believed that its name in Basque, Iruña, dates back to before the Roman invasion, in around 27BC.

Throughout its history, Navarra has preserved a special degree of fiscal and administrative autonomy dating back to medieval times, like the neighbouring Basque region. Traditionally one of Spain’s industrial powerhouses, the city now struggles to resolve the tension between preserving its ancient past, and embracing the new.

What’s everyone talking about?

The city is forcefully clamping down on sexual assault and violence during San Fermín through adverts, workshops (self-defence for women, and education classes for men), and a 24-hour telephone line, as well as more long-term initiatives to tackle gender inequality.

“No celebration should mean women’s rights are suspended, nor institutional responsibility,” says Vanesa Eguiluz, the local councillor for equality. “A city is only free when women can move around it with freedom, without fear or violence.”

What’s next for the city?

After being governed by the right for almost three decades, Pamplona made a significant political shift in 2015 when it elected an art history teacher called Joseba Asirón to the role of mayor, from the leftist coalition EH Bildu.

“In its immediate future, Pamplona will see if the change sticks or not,” says local resident Altable. “You can smell it in the air; there’s a will to do things differently, but it’s still at a turning point. Either we all change, or we will go back to doing things the old way and to the dark past.” (The city has strong ties with the Catholic church and is home to the University of Navarre, owned by the ultra-secretive Opus Dei.)

Pamplona anima a otras ciudades a seguir su estela contra las agresiones sexistas - Los fuegos artificiales se mantienen como cita más multitudinaria y aumenta el público en la Plaza del Castillo

D.N. - Viernes, 15 de Julio de 2016 - Actualizado a las 13:41h

PAMPLONA. 1,5 millones de personas han participado en los actos programados dentro de las fiestas de San Fermín que este año han contado con cinco espacios participativos impulsados por distintos colectivos. En las cifras totales destacan el número de personas que se acercaron a ver los disparos de las colecciones de fuegos artificiales y que sumaron 424.000 espectadores y las que acudieron a las verbenas que han regresado a la Plaza del Castillo (más de 140.000 personas).

Otro incremento de público reseñable se ha producido en el ciclo Jazzfermín que ha regresado estas fiestas a su ubicación original en la plaza de Compañía, tras dos años de ausencia. Estos son los principales datos del balance festivo que ha sido presentado esta mañana en rueda de prensa por el alcalde de Pamplona, Joseba Asiron, acompañado por los concejales delegados de Segurida Ciudadana y Convivencia, Aritz Romeo, y de Cultura, Política Lingüística, Educación y Deporte, Maider Beloki, y la concejala especial de Igualdad y LGTBI, Laura Berro.

El alcalde Asirón ha animado a otras ciudades y ayuntamientos a seguir la "estela" de la capital navarra en la lucha contra las agresiones sexistas durante la celebración de fiestas populares. El alcalde ha informado de que Policía Nacional, Guardia Civil, Policía Foral y Policía Municipal han recogido en Sanfermines cuatro denuncias por agresión sexual, una por intento de agresión y once por tocamientos, aunque en uno de los casos el fiscal ha pedido que la denunciante sea imputada judicialmente por simulación de delito y detención ilegal.



En total, ha habido 16 detenidos, siete relacionados con agresiones sexuales (incluido el de la denuncia en la que no se han apreciado indicios de delito) y once por abusos (incluida la mujer imputada por simulación).



De los 16 detenidos, 9 son de procedencia extranjera y 7 son españoles.



Entre los principales datos de balance, en los Sanfermines este año se han registrado un 1,09% de menos corredores en el Encierro y han aumentado las denuncias por infracciones en la carrera gracias a la mayor vigilancia tras la colocación de cámaras de videovigilancia. El total de denuncias recogidas en las fiestas por todos los cuerpos de seguridad en Pamplona ha ascendido a 1.923. Ha aumentado el trabajo de los servicios de limpieza que han recogido durante todas las fiestas más de un millón de kilos de basura (6,6% más que en 2015).

Desde el punto de vista de difusión de la fiesta y midiendo como ejemplo la red social Twitter, se han registrado más de tres millones de impactos sobre los Sanfermines (un 60% más que el año pasado). Además, la Oficina de Turismo del Ayuntamiento atendió estos Sanfermines, del 6 al 14 de julio, a 7.531 turistas, una cifra prácticamente igual a la del año pasado (7.542). Del total, el 57% eran turistas nacionales y 3.235 visitantes desde el extranjero. Según los datos disponibles, los tres países desde los que se han recibido más visitantes han sido Francia, con 1.310 personas atendidas en la Oficina de Turismo; Estados Unidos, 376; e Italia, 276.

El balance se completa con los datos de la consigna municipal, instalada en la plaza de San Francisco para facilitar la estancia a los visitantes. En total, la consigna realizó 850 servicios, lo que supone una disminución del 44% con respecto a 2015, cuando se contabilizaron 1.512 servicios.

El favor del público: 1,5 millones de participantes

El programa oficial este año ha obtenido el respaldo de casi 1,5 millones de personas. Son 13.000 participantes más que en 2015 en los actos propiamente municipales, a los que habría que sumar otros 100.000 asistentes a los actos programados en los cinco espacios colectivos que por primera vez se han puesto en marcha: Bosquecillo, Taconera, San francisco, Recoletas y Plazuela de San José.

En cifras absolutas los fuegos artificiales (424.000 espectadores), la Comparsa de Gigantes y Cabezudos (185.000) y las Verbenas de la plaza del Castillo (más de 140.000 personas) han sido los actos con mayor afluencia de público estas fiestas. En términos relativos, esas mismas verbenas y los espectáculos del ciclo Jazzfermin –de nuevo en su escenario habitual- han sido las propuestas cuya afluencia más se ha incrementado con un 64%, un 33%, respectivamente. También se ha registrado, en número de espectadores, el refuerzo de la programación infantil.

La retransmisión del Chupinazo, con 42.000 asistentes, ha sido de nuevo un hito de participación ciudadana a través de las cinco pantallas gigantes instaladas en distintos puntos de la ciudad (Plaza del Castillo, el paseo de Sarasate, la plaza de los Fueros, el parque de Antoniutti y la zona peatonal de Carlos III en la confluencia con la avenida de Roncesvalles).

Las citas más multitudinarias del programa

La edición de los fuegos ‘Campeón de Campeones’ ha sido con mucho la cita más multitudinaria en términos absolutos, con alrededor de 45.000 personas cada día sólo solo en la Vuelta del Castillo. La buena acogida de las modificaciones en la parte obligatoria del programa y de la iluminación del marco de lanzamiento, además del saludo final entre el público y los diseñadores, han marcado el concurso de este año.

La Comparsa de Gigantes y Cabezudos un año más bate records, convirtiéndose en la segunda cita más multitudinaria de las fiestas. En este caso las estimaciones aumentan sus fieles seguidores de los 180.000 a los 185.000 participantes en sus recorridos mañaneros por la ciudad.

La apuesta del programa por devolver a la plaza del Castillo su tradicional función de escenario de verbenas, dividiendo además el tipo de público en función de su edad, ha sido respaldada en 2016 por más de 140.000 asistentes. Esta respuesta coloca las verbenas en el tercer puesto entre los actos más multitudinarios de las fiestas. Este espacio, en el que el pasado año participaron 90.000 personas, en 2016 ha recibido público familiar por las tardes público y público joven por las noches.

La personalidad del Jazz y la fuerza de las actividades familiares

Jazzfermín ha vuelto estas fiestas a su ubicación original en la plaza de Compañía, tras dos años de ausencia. Este ciclo ha celebrado su decimonovena edición obteniendo el favor del público, que ha pasado de los 3.400 espectadores del pasado año (en paseo de Sarasate) a los 10.300 asistentes de este, además de críticas positivas en medios especializados.

El 22% de los 410 actos del programa de este año han estado destinados a público familiar e infantil, una propuesta reforzada respecto al año anterior. La respuesta en 2016 es que 7 de cada 10 personas que ha participado en el programa festivo oficial lo han hecho en una actividad de este bloque, en horario diurno, incluyendo Comparsa. El parque infantil de la plaza de la Libertad de nuevo ha sido un punto de referencia con 135.000 asistentes, 5.000 más que el pasado año. A su cierre, los espectáculos de teatro de calle de Carlos III han congregado 41.300 espectadores, 15.875 más que en 2015.

El refuerzo a las sesiones de títeres en euskera y castellano ha sido bien acogido por 11.500 espectadores, aunque las sesiones matinales han concitado menos aistencia que las diurnas. Para el año que viene el Consistorio evaluará si modificar ese espacio -ahora sin sombra- o buscar emplazamiento alternativo para este tipo de sesiones, además de ampliar las actividades infantiles a otras zonas. Los encierros infantiles mantienen las cifras de 9.000 asistentes del año pasado, y otros 10.400 menores han utilizado los trenes infantiles, participado en el Festival Infantil de Danzas o asistido a las dos actuaciones de teatro infantil de Sarasate. Estas últimas –de nueva oferta- han recibido el favor de 900 menores.

25.600 espectadores bailaron y cantaron con Los Diablos

Contando el Jazz, casi 340.000 personas asistieron a las citas musicales. De ellas, 198.200 acudieron a encuentros de música de ambientación de calle de dianas, fanfarres, bandas o charangas (165.000 espectadores) y a sesiones de música folklórica (11.300 en jotas; 7.000 en txistu y gaita; 2.500 en el festival folklorico que inicia las fiestas, etc.).

Los Diablos, dentro de las verbenas de la plaza de la Cruz que concitaron el favor de 25.600 aficionados, contó con un público de 5.000 personas. En ese mismo espacio, la música de bandas amenizó el vermú a 5.580 personas. La plaza de los Fueros mantiene aforo respecto de 2015 con 84.900 personas en sus sesiones. Fermín Muguruza y la New Orleans Basque Orkestra y Duncan Dhu, de 6 y 10 de julio, respectivamente, han sido los conciertos de más público.

Por lo que respecta al espacio de música y danzas folclóricas en Paseo Sarasate, a las jotas que ya se programaban otros años por las mañanas, este año se le ha añadido programación de tarde con actuaciones de danzas y bertsolaris que han vuelto a tener presencia en el centro de la ciudad con éxito de participación.

Además de los más de 10.000 espectadores de Jazzfermín, 14.200 han asistido a las músicas del mundo (las sesiones más multitudinarias: Cuban Beats All Star, Danbakhana Afrofusión y Kalakan) y a las sesiones de DJ que también han tenido lugar en Antoniutti. Y alrededor de 1.000 personas disfrutaron de la Coral Big Band en la plaza de Compañía.

Suman también asistentes los espectáculos taurinos (13.500); el Toro de fuego (35.200), el deporte rural de la plaza de los Fueros (5.900); las exposiciones específicas “Versus” y “carteles de San Fermín”, en Condestable (3.000 asistentes); las sesiones teatrales en el Gayarre (2.780), etc.

Atendidas 1.923 denuncias en Pamplona durante las fiestas

Las denuncias recogidas por todos los cuerpos de seguridad presentes en la fiesta han sido de 1.923, siendo más de la mitad de ellas por hurto (1.106). El año pasado se recibieron 1.656 denuncias frente a las 2.047 de 2014 y las de 2013 que estuvieron en cifras similares a las de este año con 1.827. Por orden descendente, el resto de denuncias se encuadran en otros (469), por robo o intento de robo (117), por daños (51) o por agresión o atentado al agente (30). Las personas detenidas en total en estos días de fiesta han sido 179.

En cuanto a la categoría específica de delitos contra la libertad sexual, el conjunto policías han recogido cuatro denuncias por agresión sexual, una denuncia por intento de agresión sexual y once por tocamientos, aunque en uno de los casos el fiscal ha pedido que la denunciante sea imputada judicialmente por simulación de delito y detención ilegal. Ha habido 16 detenidos acusados de estos delitos, siete relacionados con agresiones sexuales (uno en la denuncia en la que la juez no hayó indicios de delito) y once por abusos (entre ellos el del caso que la mujer imputada por simulación), lo que supone que se han producido detenciones en más del 80% de los casos denunciados. De los 16 detenidos, 9 son de procedencia extranjera y 7 españoles.

Miles de personas en las concentraciones contras las agresiones sexistas

En este sentido, Pamplona ha acogido dos concentraciones ciudadanas en contra de las agresiones sexistas en las que han participado miles de personas que el día 7 llenaron la Plaza Consistorial y las calles limítrofes y el día 11 la Plaza del Castillo y las zonas adyacentes.

Además, el punto de información de la campaña de prevención “Por unas fiestas libres de agresiones sexistas / Eraso sexistarik gabeko jaien alde” situado en la Plaza Castillo ha atendido a más del doble de personas que el año pasado con un incremento del 118%. En 2016 se han acercado a obtener información 7.475 personas 4.053 más que en 2015. Además, se han recogido 43 cuestionarios sobre incidencias de baja intensidad (18 cuestionarios más que en 2015).

Este año ha ampliado su horario de atención en una hora respecto a 2015. Se han repartido 20.00 guías en cuatro idiomas (13.000 más que el año 2015) sobre cómo identificar la violencia sexista, como frenarla, responder o buscar ayuda y atención. También se han editado para estas fiestas 10.000 dípticos con la campaña “No es No, Si es Si” en el que se incluye la imagen de un semáforo con conductas ‘rojas’ que no se pueden producir y que denotan distintos grados de agresividad hacia las mujeres y otras conductas ‘verdes’ que derivan, si se llevan a cabo, en unas fiestas vividas y disfrutadas en igualdad. Asimismo, se facilitaban teléfonos de atención y urgencias.

Para la difusión de la campaña se repartieron 20.000 pins con las manos rojas para su distribución entre la población (15.000 más que en 2015) y 240.000 servilletas de barra (120.000 más que el año pasado) además de carteles, mupis, campañas de publicidad, lonas en los escenarios, etc.

Servicio nuevo de atención a personas que sufren ataques sexistas

Con el mismo objetivo, el Ayuntamiento de Pamplona ha impulsado por primera vez un servicio de acompañamiento social para dar la necesaria cobertura técnica a la atención y/o acompañamiento social a las personas que pudieran sufrir una agresión sexual durante las fiestas de San Fermín. El personal técnico de guardia, cuya disponibilidad ha sido de 24 horas, se ha desplazado, cuando así lo ha requerido la Policía Municipal, al lugar donde se encontraban las personas agredidas para acompañarlas como figura técnica de referencia y enlace entre los diferentes dispositivos (policiales, judiciales, sanitarios, etc.) dándoles así apoyo a ellas y a sus familiares en todo el proceso.

En el mismo campo, se han realizado dos estudios: uno sobre puntos críticos en Sanfermines y otro centrado en agresiones sexistas y uso de drogas. Este último ha incluido la realización de 600 encuestas y 40 micro-entrevistas y 10 personas ejecutando estudios de campo. Por último, ha habido acciones formativas con Policía Municipal y personas contratadas para protección civil sobre cómo atender y responder en casos de agresiones en fiestas; con profesionales del Servicio de Acompañamiento Social en caso de agresión sexista del área de Acción Social y Desarrollo Comunitario; y con chicas jóvenes para acciones de autodefensa.

Por otra parte, este año el Ayuntamiento, en colaboración con la Asociación Hegoak, abrió de forma piloto un servicio informativo para la prevención y reducción de riesgos asociados al consumo de alcohol y drogas en los espacios de ocio. Este punto informativo estuvo abierto en la plaza de Recoletas los días 11, 12 y 13 de julio de 22.30 a 3.30 horas y atendió a un total de 220 personas, además de repartir medio millar de materiales informativos.

Menos corredores y más denuncias

16.448 corredores han participado en el conjunto de los ocho encierros de San Fermín 2016, 181 menos que en 2015 (un 1,09% menos). El encierro más multitudinario fue el del viernes 8 de julio, en el que corrieron 2.706 personas. El número de participantes cada día en los encierros ha sido: 7 de julio 2.594, 8 de julio 2.706, 9 de julio 2.384, 10 de julio 2.109, 11 de julio 1.790, 12 de julio 1.646, 13 de julio 1.734 y el 14 de julio 1.485.

Se mantiene la tónica de que la mayoría de los corredores (45%) son extranjeros; de los nacionales un 14% es de Pamplona y otro 4% de participantes provienen del resto de Navarra. Este año se han seguido haciendo encuestas a los corredores en el recorrido por parte de un dispositivo en el que participan diariamente 500 personas, dentro del operativo de seguridad. Del 45% de corredores extranjeros, la nacionalidad más frecuente es la estadounidense (20% del total de corredores), seguida de la australiana y neozelandesa (8%) y británica (3%). Es menor la participación de corredores latinoamericanos (1,5%) y franceses (1%). El 12% restante proviene de otros países.

El balance de los encierros arroja el dato de 12 corredores con heridas por asta de toro, lo que supone dos corneados más que en 2015 y cuatro más que en el año 2014. Las cogidas se han concentrado en cuatro encierros, mientras que otras cuatro carreras han sido limpias. El encierro más peligroso fue el del 8 de julio, con toros de Cebada Gago, y que dejaron siete corredores corneados siendo también el de mayor duración con 5 minutos y 46 segundos. También fue largo el encierro del día 9, que duró 4 minutos, debido a un astado que en Santo Domingo se dio la vuelta y tuvo que hacer todo el recorrido en solitario. El resto de los encierros de Sanfermines se han caracterizado por su velocidad. El más rápido fue el del 12 de julio, que duró 2 minutos y 10 segundos.

Como novedad este año, se han instalado 6 cámaras de vigilancia de alta resolución a lo largo del recorrido del encierro, desde la Plaza Consistorial hasta la entrada del callejón, controladas por Policía Municipal desde un centro de coordinación situado en Cecop. Desde este centro de control se visiona en tiempo real el desarrollo de la carrera, durante las tareas de despeje como de la carrera en sí, con la finalidad de observar y detectar posibles infracciones graves a la ordenanza del encierro. Este visionado se realizó tanto en tiempo real como a posteriori para la identificación y localización de los autores. Es de reseñar que en el encierro del día 7 se pudo identificar, a través de este sistema de cámaras, a los presuntos autores de un supuesto delito de agresión sexual y robo con violencia o intimidación, lo que facilitó su posterior detención.

Gracias a este trabajo, Policía Municipal ha sancionado a 12 corredores por infracciones de la Ordenanza Municipal del Encierro, tres de ellas por esperar la salida de los toros dentro de un portal, dos por utilizar un medio de grabación en el recorrido del encierro, otras dos por tocar las reses, agarrando al toro y creando peligro, otras dos por correr hacia las reses creando situación de peligro y sendas denuncias por tocar las reses y por desbordar los límites de seguridad que se establecen en el encierro. De las doce denuncias, siete corresponden al sábado 9, tres al domingo 10 y las tres restantes se registraron el martes 12.

Durante los Sanfermines de 2015 se sancionó a 9 corredores por incumplimiento de la Ordenanza del Encierro. Las sanciones llevan aparejadas las multas que contempla la Ley Foral 2/1989, de 13 de marzo, Reguladora de Espectáculos Públicos y Actividades Recreativas de Navarra.

Más basura recogida

En cuanto a la limpieza, el total de kilos de vidrio y basura recogidos en el entorno festivo ha aumentado un 6,64%. En 2016 se han recogido 1.051.612 kilos, por los 986.100 kilos del año anterior. Desglosado por conceptos, la recogida de vidrio ha aumentado un 6,04% y supuso 414.100 kilos en estas pasadas fiestas (390.500 en 2015). También ha aumentado la basura y el barrido. Este último ha crecido un 9,02%, recogiéndose 394.820 kilos este año, frente a los 362.820 de 2015. Por último, ha subido un 3,96% la recogida de basura: en 2016 se han retirado 242.692 kilos, mientras que en 2015 se recogieron 233.440.

El servicio de limpieza municipal se refuerza con la llegada de los Sanfermines y pasa de las 110 personas habitualmente contratadas durante el año para realizar esas labores de lunes a viernes a las 240 del dispositivo establecido para las fiestas. Se cuenta, además, con 50 vehículos o máquinas para realizar esas labores de limpieza. Todos esos medios han provocado que se finalizase antes la labor de limpieza en el Casco Antiguo y se pudieran trasladar los equipos a otras zonas periféricas de la fiesta, como los Ensanches, Rochapea o San Juan, igualmente necesitadas de atención reformazas de limpieza.

El marcador del aspecto de limpieza en la ciudad es el dato recogido como ‘barrido en el entorno festivo’, que incluye la gran recogida de basura en la madrugada de cada día en el Casco Antiguo de la ciudad, así como el barrido manual y de máquinas y el baldeo de las calles. El Servicio Municipal de Limpieza analizará estos datos, si bien inicialmente apuntan a que este año ha habido más gente en el entorno festivo. Asimismo, se apunta a que es necesaria una mayor implicación del sector hostelero y la del ciudadano.

Asimismo, este año se ha aplicado un repelente de orines en distintas zonas del Casco Antiguo. Según la información disponible en el área, es difícil valorar el efecto disuasorio del producto, pero sí que se ha comprobado que al formar una película sobre la superficie aplicada se reduce el olor y además es más fácil de limpiar y eliminar los restos. También ha servido para poner de manifiesto el problema de los orines en San Fermín y concienciar a la ciudadanía.

142 inspecciones alimentarias y 179 requerimientos por ruido

El Servicio de Inspección Alimentaria del Ayuntamiento de Pamplona ha realizado 142 actos de inspección en los mesones del ferial del Runa, Antoniutti, Casas Regionales, Bosquecillo, espacios ciudadanos, los espacios de conciertos de Plaza de los Fueros y Plaza de la Cruz, bares, restaurantes y otras actividades permanentes y no permanentes de hostelería y alimentación. Esta actividad supone un incremento del 46% con respecto al año pasado, cundo se realizaron 97 inspecciones. Del total de inspecciones, 47 se llevaron a cabo los días previos a las fiestas y 97 durante los Sanfermines.

Asimismo, se han analizado 16 muestras de alimentos, de las que sólo se localizó una en mal estado de conservación. Como resultado, se han detectado 73 deficiencias, fundamentalmente en instalaciones y aparatos. En lo que se refiere al estado de los alimentos, destaca el decomiso de comida preparada en un mercado de comida latina ligado al espacio de Recoletas, donde se decomisaron alrededor de 15 kilos de alimentos al no haber garantías de su origen ni de su elaboración.

El control de ruidos en establecimientos y vía pública durante las fiestas ha dejado un saldo de 1.766 controles, cerca de 200 controles diarios, una cifra similar a la del año pasado. En 179 casos se detectaron emisiones altas o muy altas. Al igual que el año anterior, destaca el hecho de que en los establecimientos de la cuesta del Labrit todas las instalaciones han tenido la misma música, lo que ha hecho disminuir la presión sonora en la zona en relación a años anteriores. No obstante, se ha detectado la música demasiado elevada en algunas de las inspecciones, al igual que ha ocurrido en el recinto ferial de la Runa donde están situadas las barracas.

En las calles hosteleras principales, los puntos negros han estado en la zona superior de la calle Estafeta y en la calle san Nicolás, con establecimientos a los que se les ha amonestado repetidamente por mostrar altavoces hacia la calle o por tener la música demasiado alta y las puertas y ventanas abiertas. La situación de las terrazas de la calle Olite mejoró los últimos días de las fiestas, aunque aún tuvo algún episodio suelto de música en directo no permitida. Es recurrente la colocación de altavoces a la calle en algunos de los establecimientos con licencias exprés. En todos los casos en que se ha detectado se les ha hecho requerimiento.

Menor afluencia en los servicios de duchas a partir del fin de semana

El paso del fin de semana y la bajada de la temperatura se dejó notar en el uso del servicio de duchas que se oferta durante las fiestas tanto en Antoniutti como en la Casa de Baños de la calle Eslava. En total se han prestado 3.418 duchas, un 3,63% menos que en 2015. En cuanto a los aseos públicos, se han ofertado un total de 465 de forma permanente entre los días 6 y 14 de julio, número ampliado por los aseos químicos instalados en los espacios ciudadanos. Asimismo, este año se ha ampliado el servicio de los aseos ubicados en el puente de Curtidores. Estos aseos permanecerán abiertos hasta el domingo 17 de julio, ya que las instalaciones del Ferial de La Runa funcionarán hasta dicho día.

En cuanto a datos de Sanidad ambiental, se han realizado 95 inspecciones y se han tomado 39 muestras de agua de fuentes públicas, de las que sólo siete resultaron incorrectas. Las altas temperaturas y el mal uso de las fuentes por parte de algunos usuarios han propiciado la presencia de patógenos aunque en todos los casos han sido en baja cantidad y se ha solucionado de manera inmediata.

Por último, desde el servicio de Zoonosis se han realizado 12 intervenciones en el control de animales (tres gatos y nueve perros), lo que supone una clara disminución respecto a años anteriores: el año pasado hubo que realizar 68 intervenciones de control de animales.

Incremento de pago con móvil en la zona naranja

Este año, al igual que los tres últimos años, se ha implantado la zona naranja a lo largo de todas las zonas reguladas de la ciudad durante las 24 horas y durante todos los días de fiesta. Se habían realizado hasta el día 14, 181.089 operaciones. De ellas, 133.399 (74%) han sido en los expendedores situados en la vía pública y 47.690 a través del móvil (26%). Este dato significa que han aumentado un 10% las operaciones realizadas a través del móvil. Este porcentaje se mantiene en cuento a la recaudación que ha ascendido a 429.095 euros con 327.018 euros en los expendedores y 102.077 euros abonados a través de la aplicación del móvil. Se han impuesto un total de 3.380 denuncias, que han descendido desde las 4.623 del año pasado, y se han realizado 854 actuaciones con la grúa.

Estos San Fermines se han registrado 43 accidentes de los cuales 4 han sido atropellos con un balance total de 10 heridos leves frente a los 44 accidentes atendidos en el 2015, tres de ellos atropellos que nos dejaron un balance de 11 heridos leves y 1 herido grave. Por otra parte, Policía Municipal ha realizado continuas etilometrías pruebas de detección de drogas para disuadir y sancionar a los que durante las fiestas tras la ingesta de alcohol u otro tipo de drogas, ha utilizado el coche, de las cuales 50 han sido positivas con denuncia administrativa y 11 con detención del conductor y tramitación al Juzgado frente a los 3 detenidos del año anterior.

Más de 3 millones de impactos en Twitter, un 60% más que en 2015

La conversación sobre San Fermín en Twitter ha batido todos los récords en 2016 y ha superado todas las previsiones. Según el estudio realizado por el Ayuntamiento de Pamplona con la herramienta navarra Tweet Binder, las fiestas han llegado prácticamente a todos los timelines de los usuarios de Twitter. En total, se han generado un total de 3.221.425.607 impactos, frente a los 2.019.909.447 del año pasado, lo que supone un incremento del 60% de la actividad en esta red social. El crecimiento es exponencial, dado que sólo un año antes, en 2014, el número de impactos en Twitter rondaba el medio millón.

Los 250.000 tuits emitidos por 116.000 usuarios en 2015 se han visto superados este año 2016, ya que se han registrado más de 310.000 tuits lanzados por 137.080 cuentas. Como años anteriores, el Chupinazo y los encierros ha sido lo más comentado en esta red social, donde destacan los tuits emitidos por medios y agencias internacionales como The New York Times, Associated Press, Reuters, The Economist y Radio Caracol.

El idioma predominante de los tuits es el castellano, el 79% de los mensajes se lanzan en esta lengua; el 11,7% de los tuits se lanzan en inglés; y la tercera lengua de las conversaciones sanfermineras es el japonés, con un 1,5% de los tuits. De forma menor, hay tuits, en este origen de relevancia, en italiano, portugués, francés, indonesio, alemán y noruego. Y aunque la actividad se registra a diario, los tres primeros días de fiesta concentraron el mayor volumen de mensajes. Destacan especialmente dos momentos: el del Chupinazo, con más de 3.400 cuentas diferentes de Twitter lanzando mensajes entre las 12 del mediodía y las 2 de la tarde; y el primer encierro, el día 7, cuando se alcanzó un nuevo pico de entre las 7 y media y las 8 y media de la mañana: se lanzaron más de 4.000 tuits desde otras tantas cuentas diferentes, en los que se incluyeron 1.502 imágenes.

Más de 400 profesionales acreditados para los encierros

Los Sanfermines siguen siendo un referente mediático e informativos. Más de 400 profesionales gráficos y periodistas de 115 medios de comunicación de todo el mundo se han acercado a Pamplona para cubrir los encierros de fiestas. Se han interesado por el encierro fotógrafos freelance, agencias nacionales e internacionales, periódicos de diferentes países, radios, productoras cinematográficas y de televisión... El Ayuntamiento de Pamplona ha acreditado a profesionales de 15 países: Estados Unidos, Argentina, China, Reino Unido, Eslovenia, Francia, Turquía, República Checa, Filipinas, Italia, Alemania, Suecia, Holanda, Colombia y España.

La cobertura de las fiestas a nivel regional, nacional e internacional comenzó desde el Chupinazo el pasado día 6. Esa mañana se contabilizaron 179 personas acreditadas por el Ayuntamiento en la propia Casa Consistorial y en Casa Seminario para cubrir el inicio de los Sanfermines. Esos profesionales trabajaban para 45 medios de comunicación. Para el Pobre de Mí estuvieron acreditadas 105 personas de 38 medios de comunicación. Esas acreditaciones se han repartido desde primeros de julio en Baluarte, en la Oficina Internacional de Prensa, un proyecto en el que colaboran el Ayuntamiento, el Gobierno de Navarra y la Asociación de Periodista de Navarra para que los medios de comunicación tengan un espacio de referencia durante las fiestas.

Bavuma says he and the paceman Kagiso Rabada want to help inspire young black compatriots to escape the poverty trap

“I believe I have planted a seed in younger guys. If they see me – someone from the same roots – coming up and doing it at international level, they will have the belief that they can too.” These are the words of Temba Bavuma, the South Africa middle-order batsman who will face England on Thursday, as we sit on a bench in the sunshine at the back of the Victorian pavilion at Lord’s after practice on Tuesday afternoon and discuss our memories of his maiden Test century at Newlands in January 2016.

For England supporters the run-soaked draw under Table Mountain, in what would go on to be a 2-1 series win for Alastair Cook’s tourists, will chiefly be remembered for Ben Stokes igniting the afterburners on the second morning with a record-breaking 258 from No6 that was simply jaw-dropping in its unbridled violence against the bowlers.

But a moment that will perhaps be referenced in years to come instead came on the fourth evening, as a thick edge off Steven Finn ran for four to vacant third man and saw Bavuma become the first black South African to reach the hallowed three-figure mark in Test cricket.

For all the significance of this, coming 25 years after readmission and in an era of transformation policies, Bavuma’s emotions were understandably personal. Seven Tests into his career – the mark that certainly England batsmen of late have been deemed to have had a fair crack – the right-hander felt under pressure for his spot.

“I remember seeing my parents and my sister in the stand and their jubilation and joy. For me it was the relief at putting in a performance for my team. It gives me goosebumps now thinking back,” says Bavuma, who grew up in the township of Langa, 12km down the road from South Africa’s picture-perfect cricketing citadel.

While a feature of this compact 5ft 4in right-hander’s innings was some, ahem, running commentary from Stokes – “it’s something I have grown up with. Being short, guys target you. He’s spirited and plays hard but was also one of the first to shake my hand” – a more vivid memory from that day has stuck with him.

“I remember kids playing cricket during the intervals. It made me think about going to Newlands when I was young and doing the same. Seeing them inspired me, and that most of them were from Langa also added an extra special taste.”

In the days and weeks that followed, as Bavuma fever spread and the spike in television viewers that day was marvelled at, it began to dawn on him just what this meant. “I realised it wasn’t just me that scored a hundred that day. So it became a purpose of mine: to do things not just for myself but for other people. To become a role model that kids could aspire to.”

The 27-year-old grew up in a middle-class cricketing family, played street games with friends and watched his uncles playing for the local club before eventually joining them. His schooling, where his love for the game was honed, was private, first at South African College Junior School in Newlands and then St David’s Marist in Johannesburg.

These advantages have not been lost on him, such that in April this year he established a foundation in South Africa that has invested in cricket facilities in Langa and Soweto and put on coaching clinics, with the dream of one day introducing it nationwide to further the sport among the country’s 67% black population.

“The purpose is to holistically empower young black South African cricketers,” he says. “[It came from] looking at my own development, as someone born in a township but fortunate to attend places where the coaches and facilities were good. We identify the young players through clinics, we link them up with partner schools and give them their best opportunity.

“We’re not looking for the next Kagiso Rabada, it’s just about empowering them. If they become a lawyer, a doctor, that’s a win for us, because they will then be in a position to influence others. It gives them an opportunity to escape out of poverty.”

Rabada, the gifted 22-year-old fast bowler, and Bavuma discuss their positions as role models in this respect frequently. Both players are in the side on merit – Bavuma, averaging 31 from 20 Tests, still has a point to prove starting at Lord’s this week – but the topic of the racial quota that requires the national cricket team to average at least six non-whites, including two black players, across the year remains a thorny one.

Bavuma says: “We do have chats, more than just brief ones. It can get a bit deep. He’s philosophical, but he understands his existence that it’s not about him, it’s not about us, it’s about those that came before us and those who are yet to come.

“We’re paving the way for them, and that’s what motivates us in both tough times and good times. We don’t see it as a negative pressure, it’s something that drives us forward. I try to embrace it. I am still learning and growing into it, but it will always be there as long as I’m playing international cricket.”

Can he picture the day when the subject is no longer relevant? “That’s the ideal picture, where everyone is seen irrespective of colour. We’re moving towards it.”

Daniil Medvedev, the young Russian who knocked out Stan Wawrinka, is facing the prospect of heavy punishment after being forced to deny that he made an accusation of bias when he threw money at the umpire’s chair following the conclusion of his ill-tempered second-round exit.

Little sympathy for Tomic and Kyrgios but let’s not misplace our humanity | Jacob Steinberg Read more

Two days after delighting Centre Court with a nerveless win over Wawrinka, the 21-year-old found himself in hot water when he reacted angrily to a series of controversial calls during his defeat to Belgium’s Ruben Bemelmans, appeared to ask the court supervisor to remove Mariana Alves as umpire late in the fifth set then emptied his wallet of loose change moments after losing 6-4, 6-2, 3-6, 2-6, 6-2.

Wimbledon officials are likely to take a dim view of Medvedev’s conduct, despite his insistence that there was no deeper meaning to his behaviour, and he could be hit with a hefty fine.

Britain’s Heather Watson received the second-largest ever single fine in the tournament’s history last year – $12,000 (£9,043) for smashing her racket into the grass – while the record remains the $20,000 Fabio Fognini received for unsportsmanlike behaviour in 2014. The Italian was sanctioned for “damaging the court” but also received an extra fine of $7,500 for abusing a tournament official and making an obscene gesture to his opponent.

Medvedev, who visited the referee’s office after completing his media duties on Wednesday night and said that he would apologise to Alves personally if he sees her, admitted it will be his fault if he has fallen foul of the authorities. There is a chance that his embarrassed demeanour in an apologetic press conference could lessen the damage.

However, he was at a loss to explain why he threw money at Alves’s chair. “I was just frustrated, so it has no meaning,” he said. “I haven’t thought about it.”

Medvedev, who was defaulted from a tournament in the US last year after questioning the impartiality of an umpire, was at pains to stress that he was not insinuating bias on the part of the official. “It would be really stupid,” he claimed. “It was stupid, but it was not like this. It was just that I was packing my things and I saw my wallet. In the heat of the moment I did a stupid thing. I was ready to leave the court, but that’s what happened. I don’t even remember what the coins were.”

Wimbledon diary: Watson’s coach gets ready for a close shave Read more

But the world No49 could not justify his behaviour and said that he had immediately regretted it. His unhappiness grew after squandering a 2-0 lead in the fifth set and his frustration boiled over when he found himself trailing 5-2 at a changeover. Docked a point after arguing with Alves, he called for the supervisor.

Asked whether he requested Alves’s removal, Medvedev replied: “I don’t actually remember what I said. It was a long match … very hot out there.”

It represented an unsatisfactory end for the Russian, who had never won a grand slam match before beating Wawrinka, the No5 seed and US Open champion.

“I was disappointed with the result,” he said. “It was frustrating after a big win. The match was not going well for me. In the heat of the moment, I did a bad thing. I apologise. Sometimes you are unhappy with the call. Sometimes it’s in your favour. It happens.”

Heather Watson has a cruel sense of humour. When her coach Morgan Phillips offered to shave his head if the British No2 makes the second week of a grand slam for the first time in her career, Watson appreciated the sentiment but was worried about the consequences for him. “I said ‘no, your girlfriend will kill you … you can shave your legs’,” Watson said after her excellent 6-0, 6-4 victory over Anastasija Sevastova, with a wicked smile. Razors at the ready if the 25-year-old beats Victoria Azarenka on Friday.

Murray horse is neigh good

Shortly before Andy Murray delighted a packed Centre Court crowd on Wednesday an appropriately-named horse, Murray Mount, was backed into 5-4 favourite in the 2.20pm 2m4f handicap chase at Worcester. Unfortunately it stumbled badly at the sixth, made another mistake three out, and weakened in the run-in before finishing fourth.

Cash did it for Dad

On Wednesday was the 30th anniversary of Pat Cash’s Wimbledon win over Ivan Lendl but the Australian – who now coaches Coco Vandeweghe – says he did not spend last night celebrating. “I am not really into anniversaries,” he said. “Just ask my ex-wife.” Cash was also asked about that famous moment when he climbed to the players’ box to celebrate with his father, Pat Snr. Said Cash. “It wasn’t planned very well. The night before I knew I was going to win but that made it very stressful, with the expectation on yourself but it was worth it. With my dad no longer with me, it was a special moment but I can’t watch it anymore. It just makes me cry.”

Tennis journo-men

Those desperate to watch some tennis on middle Sunday, traditionally a day of rest for players and staff, could do worse than to head to Wimbledon Park where the 23rd Annual Press Tournament – held in memory of Elena Baltacha – will take place. Among the hacks who have paid the £10 entrance fee, one claims to be “Federer-like” while another reckons they are “the best there is”. Alas, none of the ex-players working for the media are signed up, which means there is little chance of coming up against the likes of John McEnroe or Tracy Austin and putting their claims to the test.

Nadal goes shopping

Rafael Nadal may know his way around grass and clay courts, but he struggled when confronted with a supermarket self-service checkout machine. The former Wimbledon champion, now world No2, was spotted shopping for groceries in a Tesco Express by a fan, who offered to lend a hand. He bought six cans of Diet Coke, though did not purchase a carrier bag, according to fellow shopper Nick Roberts, who shared his excitement on Twitter. “Just done Rafa Nadal’s shopping for him on the self service tills on the Tesco Express in Wimbledon village. Surreal,” he wrote. “He bought a 6 pack of Diet Coke. Didn’t need a bag. Environmentally conscious and awesome at tennis.”

Mum’s the word

Victoria Azarenka, who plays Heather Watson on Friday, has stepped up the pressure on the WTA to do more to help women players with young children. The former world No1, who gave birth to her son Leo last year, said the women’s tour had fallen behind the men’s tour. “The guys have that luxury of having the nurseries and stuff at every event and I think it’s time for women to have the same benefit,” she said. “For women it is much more important and harder.” Azarenka also paid tribute to Mandy Minella, who played her first-round match while four and a half months pregnant. “I’m very happy for her. But, you know, she’s doing it, and she obviously feels good. Until the doctor says, ‘Hey, cut it, you know, quit’, I think it’s wonderful.”

• United confident Belgium international will join before tour starts on Sunday • Chelsea must now decide whether they make a counter-offer

Manchester United have agreed a £75m fee with Everton to buy Romelu Lukaku and are confident of pushing through the deal before the weekend so that the Belgium striker can fly out with the rest of the team to the United States on Sunday.

Lukaku would be United’s second summer signing after the arrival of Benfica’s Swedish centre-back Victor Lindelof for £31m. The club’s manager, José Mourinho, had become frustrated with the lack of progress on signings as he had said early on in the summer that he wanted as many new arrivals in place before they set off for their pre-season tour.

The move, if it goes through, will be a significant blow to Chelsea, whose manager, Antonio Conte, had identified Lukaku early on as his main reinforcement up front. The champions, who have been unable as yet to offload Diego Costa, must now decide whether or not to table their own counter-offer to Everton for Lukaku.

Reports in Belgium have suggested the Italian has spoken to the Everton forward over recent weeks, outlining where he sees him in his first-team plans and stressing his significance to the side’s approach, and had envisaged the deal being completed before his own squad return for pre-season training next Monday.

Missing out on the Belgian would place further strain on Conte’s relationship with the Chelsea board, with the manager having been frustrated to date at the club’s inability to add to his options. The club have seen the likes of Asmir Begovic, Nathan Aké, Tammy Abraham and John Terry depart either on permanent or long-term loan deals, and have only confirmed the arrival of Willy Caballero on a free transfer from Manchester City.

Conte, who had infuriated the hierarchy by texting Costa to inform him he was no longer in his plans, has pinned much on Lukaku’s addition, and it will be intriguing to see if the club’s hierarchy now act swiftly to lodge their own bid with Everton for the striker’s services.

The alternative options would, ironically enough, be Álvaro Morata – whom United had previously targeted – or the Torino forward, Andrea Belotti, though both know they were always second-choice to Lukaku.

United dropped their interest in Morata this week after the Spanish club refused to lower their asking price of €90m (£79m).

Manchester United have completed the signing of the Swedish international defender Victor Lindelof from Benfica on a four-year deal.

The 22-year-old centre‑back arrived at Manchester United’s Aon Training Complex on Wednesday morning after the two clubs agreed a fee understood to be €35m (£31m).

José Mourinho, the United manager, told the club’s official website: “Victor is a very talented young player, who has a great future ahead of him at United.

“Our season last year showed us that we need options and quality to add depth to the squad and Victor is the first to join us this summer. I know that our fantastic group of players will welcome him as one of us.”

Lindelof had arrived in Manchester fresh from international duty with Sweden, where he was an unused substitute in the teams’s 1-1 draw with Norway on Tuesday night.

He has been a long-time target for United as they look to bolster their defensive options for the club’s return to the Champions League next season.

He told United’s official website: “I am thrilled to be joining Manchester United. I have enjoyed my time at Benfica enormously and I have learned a lot there. But I’m looking forward to playing in the Premier League at Old Trafford and for José Mourinho.

“I’m keen to get started and make my contribution to the team’s efforts to win more trophies.”

Lindelof could be one of three or four high-profile acquisitions at Old Trafford this summer, with the club also believed to be keen on acquiring the Spain striker Álvaro Morata from Real Madrid.

The Real Madrid forward’s agent said this week that United had lodged a “very important offer” with the Spanish giants to try to bring him to the Europa League champions. PA

• Cavendish says he and his family targeted after Tour de France crash • ‘I’m paying now for the attitude I had as a kid – Peter and I are friends’

Mark Cavendish has hit out at the “vile and threatening” abuse he has received on social media in the wake of the collision with Peter Sagan that ended both cyclists’ participation in the Tour de France.

Tour de France: Chris Froome in yellow jersey as Fabio Aru wins stage five Read more

Cavendish was forced to abandon the Tour with a broken shoulder suffered in the incident which resulted in Sagan’s disqualification, and says the hurtful messages he and his family have received since must stop.

“Everybody is entitled to their opinions”, Cavendish said in a video message posted on Twitter. “But please note it is a sport. Vile and threatening comments on social media to myself and my family isn’t deserved. I’d ask you all to respect that and please not send threatening or abusive language to myself and my family.”

Cavendish sad he has sorted things out with Sagan, the reigning world champion, and the Briton believes he is being targeted partly because of his behaviour during his younger years.

“I’m paying now as a 32-year-old for the attitude I had as a kid,” he said. “Unfortunately this will never leave me and I’ll always deal with the brunt of people’s personal opinions.

“I’ve missed the race that I’ve built my career around. Unfortunately these things happen in cycling, especially in the chaotic finale of the sprint, but there’s no hard feelings between Peter and I. We are friends, he apologised after and called me in the evening as well. That’s a measure of the man he is.”

Bernard Tomic has been fined £11,600 ($15,000) for “unsportsmanlike conduct” after admitting in a press conference that he faked an injury. The fine is understood to be the second largest fine for a single infraction in the tournament’s history.

Tomic was slammed by former Australian players for admitting to feeling “bored” and not being really concerned by his grand slam results following his 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 first round loss to German veteran Mischa Zverev.



The 24-year-old’s level of effort has frequently been called into question, and he said on Tuesday: “I couldn’t care less if I make a fourth round at the US Open or I lose first round. To me, everything is the same. I’m going to play another 10 years, and I know after my career I won’t have to work again.”

Daniil Medvedev, the young Russian who knocked out Stan Wawrinka, has also been fined three times for a total of £11,200 ($14,500) for unsportsmanlike conduct after the officials decreed he had made an accusation of bias when he threw money at the umpire’s chair following the conclusion of his ill-tempered second-round exit against Belgium’s Ruben Bemelmans. Medvedev seemed to ask the court supervisor to remove Mariana Alves as umpire late in the fifth set then emptied his wallet of loose change moments after losing 6-4, 6-2, 3-6, 2-6, 6-2.

Medvedev was given a $4,000 fine for a warning after badmouthing the umpire, a $3,000 fine for a point penalty and $7,500 for the coin-throwing incident.



It is not the first time Medvedev, who knocked out Stan Wawrinka in the first round, has been in hot water over his conduct towards officials. At a second-tier event last year, the 21-year-old was defaulted from a match after saying umpire Sandy French was “friends” with his opponent Donald Young. Both are black.

So far in this Wimbledon £25,900 worth of fines have been issued. By the close of Wimbledon last year £57,000 in fines had been doled out to tennis players.

• Emirates game to kick off season on 11 August at 7.45pm • Bournemouth to host Brighton on Friday 15 September

The Premier League season will kick off on a Friday night for the first time, with Arsenal against Leicester City at the Emirates Stadium having been chosen for the somewhat contentious slot by Sky TV.

The definition of the opening weekend has been stretched, with Arsenal to host the curtain-raiser at 7.45pm on Friday 11 August. The league has announced the changes to the schedule driven by the TV companies and the standout detail is the earlier than expected start.

Sky introduced Friday night football last season to mixed success, with the experience beginning with Manchester United’s home win over Southampton on 19 August. Under the terms of its agreement, Sky can select up to 10 matches per season for Friday viewing.

They chose only seven last season as juggling the congested league schedule with the other competitions proved problematic. Chelsea secured the title with their victory at West Bromwich Albion on a Friday.

One other game in the season’s opening two months has been scheduled for a Friday – Bournemouth’s home game against Brighton on 15 September.

Mark Cavendish has withdrawn from the Tour de France after he suffered a fractured shoulder blade in a horrendous crash 200 metres from the finish line on stage four. Cycling’s governing body quickly disqualified the world champion, Peter Sagan, for a dangerous move in the sprint finish in which he appeared to elbow the British rider to the floor.

Cavendish also sustained a heavy cut to his hand and was taken to hospital for x-rays to investigate injuries to the shoulder he damaged in a similar pile-up at the end of the first stage of the Tour in Harrogate in July 2014. In a chaotic finale, the yellow jersey holder, Geraint Thomas, also fell – but to no ill effect.

On Tuesday night it was confirmed that Cavendish’s Tour is over. “I’m obviously massively disappointed to get this news about the fracture,” he said. “I feel I was in a good position to win [the stage] and to lose that and even having to leave the Tour, a race I have built my whole career around, is really sad.”

Cavendish’s sporting director at Dimension Data, Roger Hammond, described the move that led to Sagan’s expulsion as “a flick of the elbow which was completely outrageous”. He added: “No one comes out of it well. This is a sad, sad day for the sport, Sagan is a hero and an idol of mine but a precedent has to be set.”

Sagan was initially relegated to 115th place on the stage – last place in the lead bunch – and received the standard sanction of a 30-second time penalty but the president of the jury, Philippe Marien, said the referees applied a sterner sanction because the world champion “had put several other riders involved in the crash in danger”.

Sagan’s Bora-Hansgrohe team announced they had officially protested about the Slovak’s expulsion. The German team said Sagan “rejected [the claim] to have caused, or in any way intended to cause, the crash of Mark Cavendish”. On Wednesday morning, Sagan appeared to have accepted his fate.

“I can accept the decision but for sure I do not agree with them, because I think I have done nothing wrong,” Sagan said in a statement delivered outside the team hotel.

“It is very bad that Mark fell down, it is important he can recover well, I am sorry for that,” he added. “As you saw it was a crazy sprint, it was not the first one like that or the last one. I wish that Mark recovers well.”

In two crashes in the final kilometres involving about 20 riders, it was Cavendish who came off worst, being the first of three sprinters to hit the deck. He lay prone on the tarmac as the rest of the group passed and crossed the line several minutes after the stage winner, Arnaud Démare. Cavendish was holding his right shoulder, with his skin suit ripped from shoulder to waist, and with heavy bandaging on his right hand.

“I’m going to go and get it checked out,” he said. “I will definitely need stitches in this finger, it’s bleeding a lot. With the shoulder, it might be something to do with a previous injury, it’s sat backwards, so I’m not sure if I’ve done something to the ligament. I’m not a doctor but from the feelings, I’m not optimistic.”

The Guardian understands he hit the road so hard he folded the spider and the chainring of his chainset so that they were pointing backwards. Sagan was one of several riders, including Cavendish, who launched their sprints in the wake of the Norwegian Alexandr Kristoff and were accelerating to full speed with around 250m to go. Cavendish was following Démare through a gap between Sagan and the crowd barriers when the Slovak moved to his right, making contact with the Manxman.

Sagan then lifted his elbow up and Cavendish was forced into the barriers in a split second and fell heavily on his right side. “There was no reason for that elbow,” said Hammond. “As a former professional bike rider I know the way it is done.” The German John Degenkolb, who was close behind, rode over Cavendish’s body and helmet and also fell, while the Briton Ben Swift performed a somersault over Cavendish’s bike as it lay on the ground but later told the Guardian he had no injuries.

“I get on with Peter well; if he came across that’s one thing but I’m not a fan of him putting his elbow in me like that,” Cavendish said. “A crash is a crash but I would just like to know about the elbow. I have a good relationship with Peter but I would like to speak to him about it.”

The world champion apologised to Cavendish afterwards but offered no real explanation. “I didn’t know Mark was behind me, he was coming from the right side and I wanted to take the wheel of Kristoff, I think. I wanted to go on his wheel but Mark was coming pretty fast from the back. I didn’t have time to react to go left, he just came to me and then to the barriers.”

Sagan added: “When I was told after the finish that Mark had crashed, I went straight away to find out how he was doing. We are friends and colleagues in the peloton and crashes like that are never nice. I hope Mark recovers soon.”

Philippe Marien, the head UCI commissaire [race official], said: “Before the Tour de France we warned the sprinters that we would look very closely at every sprint, that is what we did today. It was not an easy decision, but this is the beginning of the Tour and now is the moment to set our boundaries. And that is what we did today. It was not about Sagan, but about the act the rider made. What happens here, it looks like it was on purpose and it almost looks like hitting a person. It’s not about Cavendish and Sagan, it could be anybody, the names won’t matter.”

Better known as a sedate spa town and a still mineral water, Vittel does things when the Tour comes to visit. In 1968 this was the start town for a Tour de Santé, supposedly to relaunch the sport in the wake of Tom Simpson’s death, but which ended in two positive drug tests over the three weeks.

On Tuesday, what should have been a decorous celebration of 10 years in which Vittel has been the ‘eaufficiel’ du Tour, ended in Sagan’s disqualification.

This was a massive event, partly because of Sagan’s profile as the most popular rider in cycling, but also because this was the first time a world champion had been thrown off the race since Laurent Brochard was given his marching orders during the Festina drug scandal of 1998. And it is rare indeed for the race’s referees to decide that any of the plethora of dodgy manoeuvres and dirty tricks that happen in sprints is sufficiently life-threatening to merit expulsion.

The last time such a thing happened was in 2010 when the mild-mannered Australian Mark Renshaw decided to use his head as well as his legs at Bourg les Valence, not once, but several times, while in 1997 the otherwise utterly genteel Belgian Tom Steels was sent home for bunging a bidon at a fellow fast man.

The problem boils down to this: sprinters are usually as pleasant as they come, but the scent of the line causes a red mist to descend. This is part of their makeup, but just occasionally there is an attempt to draw a line. Unfortunately the fast men will be butting up against that line – if that is not an unfortunate choice of words – soon, probably as early as Thursday.

Sagan’s expulsion left the race for the green jersey wide open, and the favourite now will be the Frenchman Demare, who emerged from the chaos here to give France its first bunch sprint stage winner since Jimmy Casper. Demare is the national champion and rides for the national favourite Francaise des Jeux, whose patriotic manager Marc Madiot refuses to sully the tricolour by letting it be daubed with his sponsors’ logos.

France will delight in Demare’s win, which reflected well on his turn of speed and it will follow his quest for the green jersey with bated breath in the next 17 days. If there was a slight false note, it came when he was accused of misbehaviour by fourth-placed Nacer Bouhanni, who alleged he had cut him up in the finale. Then again, nor is Bouhanni a stranger to the referees’ communiques. Where sprinting is concerned, earning the right to throw the first metaphorical stone is a big ask.

On Wednesday, the race gets serious with the finish at La Planche des Belles Filles ski resort in the Vosges mountains north of Belfort. The Tour has finished here twice, in 2012 and 2014, and on each occasion the race leader at the summit – in 2012 Bradley Wiggins, in 2014 Vincenzo Nibali – has worn yellow all the way to Paris, and perhaps more importantly that the finishing order at the summit strongly reflects the eventual standings at the end of the Tour.

In both years, seven of the first 10 finishers on top of the 20% wall that concludes the six-kilometre climb also finished in the first 10 in Paris. The chances are that either Geraint Thomas or his leader Chris Froome will retain the lead for Team Sky, although the Welshman hinted that Team Sky may give free rein to a long-distance escape. In Vittel, Thomas fell in a 15-man pile-up in the final kilometre, while Froome was held up, but did not fall.

That would happen if there are no riders up front who are a threat to Froome in the overall standings, as relinquishing the lead to another team will relieve them of the need to expend energy in defence of the maillot jaune. “I don’t think we will waste a lot of energy to bring back a big break if there is no one dangerous in it, and if it goes to someone who is not a threat overall, it’s not a big deal. If we are all together on the climb Froome is our main goal, so I will do what I can to help him. If he gets the jersey, great, if I keep it, that’s even better.”

~_~

Only twice in the past 60 years have a single team held the lead from start to finish through the whole of a Tour de France, but after Chris Froome took the yellow jersey from Geraint Thomas here, that remains a possibility, albeit at this stage a remote one, with the usual provisos. It is, however, quite a feat to contemplate even if in theory, as the only rider to manage it since Jacques Anquetil in 1961 was Eddy Merckx back in his pomp in 1970.

The finish here went almost totally to plan for Sky. Froome gained time on all his rivals apart from Fabio Aru, who escaped 2.4km from the top of this brutal ascent and ended the day with a net gain of 26sec on the three-time winner, time bonuses included.

Afterwards, the new race leader openly regretted that his team had given the Italian national champion so much latitude – they did not react when he made his move – and added that it would not happen again.

The Sardinian, winner of the Tour of Spain in 2015, had endured a nightmare on his debut Tour last year, cracking in the Alps when holding eighth place overall, and had been forced to miss the Giro d’Italia in May due to a knee injury. Additionally, he was hard hit, like the rest of his team, by the death of their veteran Michele Scarponi in April.

At 27, and with the support of a strong Astana team, he is ready for a serious assault on the Tour after several years playing second fiddle to Vincenzo Nibali, who left for the newly formed Bahrain Merida team last year. His attack from well back in the select lead group brought no response from Froome’s team-mates Thomas and Mikel Nieve, and he benefited further after Froome decided to test his legs with two kilometres to go.

Only three men could hang on to the Sky leader – Richie Porte, the Irishman Daniel Martin, who is often at his best on this kind of steep finish, and Romain Bardet – but Froome stalled as the road eased, letting the rest of the lead group join up again, before they all tackled the final 20% “wall” to the finish. Aru, meanwhile, was gone for good.

As the Italian sprinted for a decisive victory – and one which might bode well for his chances on the steep climbs on Sunday’s stage to Chambéry – Froome, Martin and Porte fought it out for the minor placings. At the line, behind Porte, eight riders spanned a mere 20sec, and the chances are they will vie for the top 10 in the next couple of weeks: Bardet, Simon Yates – who took the white jersey of best under-25 – Rigoberto Urán, Alberto Contador, Nairo Quintana, Thomas, Louis Meintjes and the 2016 King of the Mountains, Rafal Majka.

Aru apart, this was plain sailing for Sky, as Porte’s BMC opted to spend the entire stage pursuing an octet that looked strong enough to divide up the stage finish and the yellow jersey between them. It was hard to figure out quite why, but among the eight was the Belgian Philippe Gilbert, who can climb sufficiently well that had he taken the yellow jersey with a few minutes in hand, he might have held it for some time. In that case Sky would have been able to look to Quickstep Floors, one of the strongest squads in the race, in controlling affairs.

Better, perhaps, to keep the British squad in the driving seat on their own in the next few days.

With BMC setting the pace, Froome and his team-mates had only to sit back and wait for the climb. They emerged late in the day, and took over from the foot of the ascent, whittling down the peloton in time-honoured style. As Froome pointed out later, there was no need for a dramatic show of strength similar to the one which effectively decided the 2012 race in their favour; here it was up to their rivals to show, and only Aru was willing or able to throw down the gauntlet.

Two flat stages await before the next climbs, Saturday’s stage through the Jura to Les Rousses. Teams with no long-term interest in the yellow jersey may look to probe Team Sky’s defences to see just how keen the British team are to hang on to the lead, and how much help they receive in controlling the race from the teams of the bunch-sprinters.

Whether or not a breakaway succeeds en route to Troyes or Nuits Saint Georges, there will be trepidation as the next bunch-sprint finish approaches, after the controversy following Mark Cavendish’s crash and Peter Sagan’s expulsion in Vittel.

Cavendish said on Wednesday that he felt the race jury had made a brave decision. “It takes a lot of balls to eliminate the world champion from the Tour de France, and I commend the jury on taking a decision that wasn’t based on influences from social media or outside,” he said. “[The jury head] Philippe Marien, he’s relegated me in the past. Whether I think I’m right or wrong, the rules were there and if I break the rules I get relegated.”

On Wednesday morning Sagan made a brief statement, repeating his apology of the previous evening, and – to his credit – underlining that while he did not agree with the verdict of the referees, he was not going to argue with it. The Tour will move on for what should be a couple of routine transition stages, assuming that such days still exist in this eternally hectic race.

• Vettel could have been banned or fined but will not be punished • Driver apologised to FIA at meeting following Azerbaijan clash

The FIA will take no further action against Sebastian Vettel after investigating the incident in which he drove into Lewis Hamilton at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. The Ferrari driver appeared at a meeting on Monday and offered a full apology for his actions, which was accepted by the FIA, alongside a commitment from the Ferrari driver to undertake educational activities across a variety of racing championships over the next 12 months.

The German admitted full responsibility and apologised to Hamilton in a statement published on his website, the first time he has done so since the incident. “During the restart lap I got surprised by Lewis and ran into the back of his car,” he said. “With hindsight I don’t believe he had any bad intentions. In the heat of the action I then overreacted and therefore I want to apologise to Lewis directly, as well as to all the people who were watching the race. I realise that I was not setting a good example.

“I had no intention at any time to put Lewis in danger but I understand that I caused a dangerous situation. Therefore I would like to apologise to the FIA. I accept and respect the decisions that were taken at today’s meeting in Paris, as well as the penalty imposed by the Stewards in Baku. I love this sport and I am determined to represent it in a way that can be an example for future generations.”

Vettel had been sanctioned by the stewards with a 10-second stop-go penalty during the race but the FIA chose to investigate the incident further, concerned by the implications of the incident, particularly in the impression it gave to young fans and drivers.

Hamilton-Vettel could be great F1 rivalry but penalty rulings must be open | Giles Richards Read more

They could have imposed a race ban, grid penalty or fine but have accepted Vettel’s admission of responsibility and declared the case closed.

Vettel hit the back of his championship rival Hamilton’s Mercedes while the pair were behind the safety car in Baku. Believing the British driver had brake-tested him he pulled alongside and, while gesticulating angrily, turned into Hamilton’s car, causing them to bang wheels. Data examined by the stewards proved Hamilton had not braked but at the time Vettel remained unrepentant and insisted both drivers should have received penalties.

The statement from the FIA read: “Following detailed discussion and further examination of video and data evidence related to the incident, Sebastian Vettel admitted full responsibility.”

Vettel has agreed to undertake educational activities at the Formula 2 and Formula 3 European Championship, the Formula 4 Championship and at the FIA Stewards’ seminar, which had been a factor in the decision.

“The FIA notes this commitment, the personal apology made by Sebastian Vettel and his pledge to make that apology public,” the statement continued. “The FIA also notes that Scuderia Ferrari is aligned with the values and objectives of the FIA. In light of these developments, the FIA president, Jean Todt, decided that on this occasion the matter should be closed.”

Hamilton had described the incident as “disgraceful” and pointedly told the race director, Charlie Whiting, on team radio that he did not believe the punishment was sufficient during the race. “A 10-second penalty for driving like that is not enough, you know that, Charlie,” he said. He had also singled out the bad impression it made after the race as a particular issue. “Imagine all the young kids that are watching Formula One today and see that kind of behaviour from a four-time world champion,” he said.

Todt was understood to have been unhappy with the leniency shown by the stewards, who could have given Vettel a black flag – disqualifying him from the race. Todt has been the driving force behind the FIA’s road safety campaign and there was considerable concern that Vettel’s actions sent out the wrong message to drivers both on track and on the road.

Vettel went on to finish fourth in Baku, one place ahead of Hamilton whom he now leads by 14 points in a tightly contested battle for the world championship. He has now accrued nine penalty points and should he receive a further three at the next race in Austria he would face an automatic ban from the British Grand Prix. He has also been informed that a repeat of similar behaviour would immediately be referred to the FIA International Tribunal for further investigation.

Having the four-time world champion perform educational activities has some precedent. In 1997 Michael Schumacher was given a retrospective punishment after driving into Jacques Villeneuve at the title decider in Jerez. He was stripped of his position as runner-up and his points, although the German was allowed to keep his race wins. He was also ordered to participate in a seven-day road safety campaign organised by the FIA and the European Commission the following year.

More recently the French driver Charles Pic was required to take part in one day of community service, requiring the driver and his race engineer to take part in the FIA’s road safety campaign after overtaking another car under a red flag during practice at the 2012 Singapore Grand Prix. A punishment that was understood to have been at the direction of Todt.

“Top-level sport is an intense environment in which tempers can flare. However, it is the role of top sportsmen to deal with that pressure calmly and to conduct themselves in a manner that not only respects the regulations of the sport but which befits the elevated status they enjoy,” said Todt in the statement.

“Sportsmen must be cognisant of the impact their behaviour can have on those who look up to them. They are heroes and role models to millions of fans worldwide and must conduct themselves accordingly.”

The Lions head coach has picked an unchanged side against the All Blacks who are looking a little uncertain with their three changes for the Eden Park decider

For a glimpse of what might lie ahead for the British & Irish Lions in the closing 80 minutes of their New Zealand tour, it is worth recalling the final act of their previous series win here in 1971. The Lions were 2-1 up going into the fourth and final Test and the All Blacks kicked off like men possessed. “For the first 20 minutes the New Zealanders played as if they’d drunk an energy potion,” the great fly‑half Barry John recalled. “I thought we were going to be stuffed.”

Steve Hansen hoping pressure on All Blacks is a challenge, not a burden | Andy Bull Read more

In the end it finished 14-14 and the Lions claimed their place in the pantheon but it was desperately close. Witnesses remember both sides being virtually out on their feet by the end of a physical, niggly encounter. Replacements and professional fitness levels have transformed the modern game but on Saturday at Eden Park, with Steve Hansen having also beefed up his back‑line physically, it will again be the survival of the fittest.

It represents a huge ask for a Lions side whose players have been battling on for almost a year without a break. Fifteen of this squad attended a pre-season training camp with England in the first week of August last year; over 11 months later they are still at it. If the Lions win this series it really will be a case of mind over matter.

All that counts for Warren Gatland, though, is Saturday. Naming an unchanged 23 suggests he feels his key men still have a bit left; if anything it is New Zealand who are casting around for fresh energy. No one would be mad enough to write off the All Blacks at Eden Park, a venue where they have not lost a Test for 23 years, but there is an unusual amount of pressure on the normally invincible hosts.

There was always a chance this series would be closer with the world’s best hooker, Dane Coles, and full‑back, Ben Smith, both unavailable through injury. So it has proved and the suspension of Sonny Bill Williams has forced Hansen to do some further tinkering. With the experienced Williams and Smith not around, the All Blacks back‑line lacks its normal air of seasoned authority. Ryan Crotty is not as celebrated a name but New Zealand are also missing the Crusaders centre.

Anton Lienert-Brown looks a very fine player in the making but is still only 22 years old. Jordie Barrett is a mere 20, which may explain why Julian Savea has been recalled ahead of the similarly youthful Rieko Ioane. Israel Dagg is suddenly the daddy of a very young back‑line containing just two survivors – Savea and Aaron Smith – of the starting one from the World Cup-winning team of 20 months ago. The Lions have some unfamiliar combinations but, increasingly, they have played more Tests together than some opposing partnerships.

It also looks as if Hansen has felt compelled to bolster his goalkicking resources after Beauden Barrett’s three costly misses amid seven successful penalties in Wellington. The younger Barrett is developing into a better goalkicker and the Lions were fully expecting him to feature. “I watched him in the warm-up against us for the Hurricanes and he was hitting the ball from a long, long way,” the Lions kicking coach, Neil Jenkins, said. “He was at an angle in our half and I was trying to say to him: ‘Get in your own half and practice.’ He wouldn’t be there if he wasn’t good enough.”

Jenkins has been equally impressed with the range of the Lions’ Elliot Daly – “he’s scary, isn’t he? He’s got a cannon attached to his hip” – but Gatland will look at New Zealand’s decision to go for more muscularity behind the scrum and know that a heavy bombardment looms on all fronts. This time, presumably, he will make more use of his bench but apart from quietly reassuring himself Mako Vunipola can be trusted to keep his cool and that Liam Williams’s other attributes outweigh his occasional misjudgments under the high ball, the rest of the XV mostly picked itself.

The head coach will not have seen it like that, having made a point of trusting his gut instinct since 2001, when his then-Ireland side lost 32-10 against Scotland at Murrayfield. “Tactically I changed the way we played and I was influenced in some selections. I promised myself I would never do that again, never back down from what I felt was the right decision.” The most extreme example came in Australia four years ago when Brian O’Driscoll was jettisoned for the final Test in Sydney. The Lions duly won 41-16 and Gatland’s judgment, not for the first time, was triumphantly vindicated.

It is interesting to look back at that victorious team now, four years on. Five of the starting XV – Jonathan Davies, Johnny Sexton, Alun Wyn Jones, Sean O’Brien and Taulupe Faletau – will start again in Auckland, with Vunipola, Conor Murray and Owen Farrell also featuring off the bench in Sydney.

One of the consequent effects is that some highly talented individuals have not even featured in this Test series. “There are some players who are pretty disappointed not to be selected and I understand that,” Gatland said. “But we have stressed all along this is not all about the 23 players but everyone in the squad.” It is no accident these Lions are still in series contention.

It has been a long while since the All Blacks lost in Auckland. Two decades, three years and three days, to be exact. But then, as Sam Whitelock said on Tuesday, “we shouldn’t have to lose to learn”, and in among all those victories, one seems particularly instructive right now.

It is the most famous of the lot, the 2011 World Cup final against France. A game a lot of New Zealanders assumed they would breeze through but which, in the end, turned out as close as they come, settled by a single point, 8-7. That match was a different order of magnitude again to the one being played on Saturday. But still, the third Test against the British & Irish Lions is, everyone agrees, the biggest that has been played in New Zealand since. “It definitely has that feel,” Jerome Kaino said, when he was asked how it compared to the World Cup final.

Three days out from the third Test, Steve Hansen sat down for a chat with a few members of the British press. He touched on a lot of topics in the 45 minutes we talked, such as his love of horses, his work as a policeman, and the business model of British rugby. Almost every last little thing, in fact, except the particulars of the upcoming match, which, he said, was a subject for another day. Hansen is a smart man, the type who does not put his finger on a piece until he is certain where he is going to move it. And at a certain point all this conversation, fascinating as it was, began to sound like a clever exercise in managing the pressure mounting on his team, a sleight of hand designed to shift the headline attention elsewhere.

“Whatever happens on Saturday is going to be great for us,” Hansen said at one point. “If we win it’ll be good, because we’ll have come through a moment. If we lose, we’ll have to look at ourselves again and say: ‘Righto, what can we take and learn from that?’ Yes, it will go down in history we lost the series, or that we won the series, but it’s really irrelevant in the long term of a player’s career. Because he’ll have to move on to the Rugby Championship. And there will be an expectation that we will play well in the Rugby Championship. Whilst in that moment it will hurt, we’ll let it go pretty quickly.” It is a fine sentiment but surely not one he will be sharing with his players. You do not get to be the best team in the world by losing the matches that matter.

Hansen pressed the point. “It’s like 2015, when we won the World Cup,” he said. “But then, OK, so what? You’ve got to win next year too, and you have to move on. So you get a wee moment to either sulk or celebrate but you’ve got to keep moving, because if you don’t keep moving someone is going to run you over. And there’s an expectation in this country that you keep moving, an expectation that we’re good at what we do. We understand that, so it doesn’t become a burden, it actually becomes a challenge.”

Hansen, who joined the All Blacks’ staff in 2004, has been around long enough to remember when the reverse was true, and the weight of expectation was a load the team struggled to bear.

This side, Hansen says, are still making that transition from 2015. It has been “harder than people realise”, he says. “You lose people like Keven Mealamu, Richie McCaw, Conrad Smith, Ma’a Nonu, Tony Woodcock. All of them, bar Conrad, have played over 100 games. And that’s a lot of experience.

“We’re very fortunate. We have a lot of people who play the game pretty well. But you don’t just snap your fingers and replace their experience. It takes time.” Time, he says, for the next group to have “their setbacks and their successes, their moments where you hang in, and the moments when you fail to hang in. Because you learn so much from that. That’s where we grow up the best, when we have adversity in our life.”

Add to that, Hansen says, “we’ve had ... adversity, with Ben Smith not playing, Sonny [Bill Williams] suspended, Ryan Crotty out, and they’re three people who play a big part in that experience, because they’ve all been there”.

“You’ve groomed them to take these other people’s places. And then bang! But what’s the positive out of that? You’ve got another group of people who have been exposed to something that maybe they’re not totally ready for, but they’re good enough to deal with it if we do things right.” He says the team is “in its infancy” but they are not as callow as all that. Kieran Read is about to play his 100th Test, Owen Franks has 93 caps, Whitelock 87, Kaino, 80, Israel Dagg 64, Brodie Retallick, 63, Beauden Barrett, 51.

Listen to Hansen long enough, and he almost manages to persuade you the All Blacks are the underdogs. “It’s 1-1. The whole world of rugby is pretty excited about that. They’re thinking: ‘Right, here we go, we’re going to knock the All Blacks off their perch.’ If that does happen, there’ll be a hell of a lot of people excited about that because they’ve got sick of us winning. That’s the reality, whether we like it or not. We don’t want that to happen, because we like winning.”

Then, with his next breath, Hansen says: “The coach’s job is not just about winning, it’s about maximising the talent and then making sure in the rest of his life that person has the tools to be able to be a decent person. If you can do that, that’s success. Doesn’t matter what else you do. Winning things, great, that’s a bonus. But the reason I coach is because I want to see your smile on your face when you can do something you couldn’t do before.” After all, he says, “it’s an important game, but it’s just a game, and don’t lose sight of that”. It hurts, he says, “to lose a game of footie”. Maybe more than he lets on.

The Tour organisers told Jan Bakelants to apologise for his stupid sexist comments but they should also update their own attitude to women’s cycling

How can you tell it’s Tour de France time? Because up pops a doping positive. Step forward André Cardoso of the Trek-Segafredo team! But this year, Cardoso may have to cede the stupid crown to Jan Bakelants. The AG2R La Mondiale rider is in trouble for his sexist/funny comments (delete as appropriate depending on your place on the evolutionary scale) about condoms and podium girls.

Asked what he would take with him for his free moments during the Tour, Bakelants said: “A packet of condoms, for sure. You never know where those podium chicks have been hanging out.” The Belgian, who won a stage and wore the Yellow Jersey at the 2013 Tour, can be excused for feeling under pressure before racing for a French team in the biggest race of the season, but this supposed joke came after he had told his interviewer he would miss his “cute little daughter” Julia the most over the three weeks of racing“but we’ll see each other every day via Skype.”

Perhaps he should realise that the attitudes he espouses about women now are the ones his daughter will grow up with. The podium girls in the revealing outfits who make nice to him and his fellow competitors day after day are not absolutely gagging for it. They’re working long days, smiling until their teeth ache, while running the risk of having their arses pinched by cyclists.

Only in cycling could a sexual assault inspire a race’s advertising strategy Read more

You might think I’m banging the same old drum again: the one I’ve beaten over the “unacceptable” kit row and the sexist poster debacle. Maybe I am. But it seems to me that, instead of evolving into a sport where equality makes antediluvian attitudes entirely redundant, cycling is ever more entrenched in its boys’ club attitudes. Brian Cookson’s abject failure in empowering the sport to deliver the kinds of fundamental reforms that women’s cycling needs to give it true parity with the men’s sport will probably not harm his chances of re-election to the leadership of the UCI later this year because men’s cycling still exists in the 1970s, a decade the women’s sport is desperate to escape.

Of course Bakelants apologised, like Peter Sagan before him. “My sincerest apologies to all those offended by my words in a so called humouristic itw. My words have been inappropriate,” he wrote on Twitter after Tour director Christian Prudhomme contacted his team “so that he makes an apology.”

While on the topic of women in cycling, the Tour might want to look closer to home. They create the conditions that help sexism persist. They should get rid of podium girls. This doesn’t need to be a gendered job. Any reasonably sentient being could give riders bouquets and shuffle them off the stage in the right direction. When the only visible women in the biggest race in cycling resemble hostesses in a tawdry daytime TV quiz show, it’s time to start asking questions about the sport’s underlying attitudes to women.

But the women riders have La Course, I hear you splutter indignantly. And yes, they will be climbing the Col d’Izoard, whose Casse Déserte has been the proving ground of champions for decades. Lest we forget that women cyclists tackled Italy’s fearsome Monte Zoncolan six years before their male counterparts. We live in a century when women in other sports are allowed to tackle distances and events on parity with men, but there remain several major problem with this year’s La Course.

Cycling needs to lose its 'podium girls' | Suze Clemitson Read more

Firstly, the women’s race is just 62km long, while the stage the men tackle on the same day is 129km. Nicole Cooke, the former Olympic and world champion, pointed out the failings of the route and mocked the supposed “progress” on Twitter. “Agreed,” tweeted Dani King. “This isn’t progress for our sport!” Molly Weaver joined in: “Disappointing La Course isn’t a stage race and that it’s so short ... seems like a parallel step!” Kathryn Bertine made the same point: “Instead of expanding to a multi-day race, La Course moves its one-day location – be careful not to confuse progress with shapeshifting.” While Yolanda Álvarez put it neatly: “Do you think we cannot do better?”

Secondly, the riders with the best times on the Col d’Izoard will then be invited to compete in a bonus stage, a pursuit around the fabled Orange velodrome in Marseille as the men tough it out on the road in the penultimate time-trial around Marseille. Just ponder this for a moment. One race is a disciplined exercise of muscle and machine, the other a hell-for-leather dash of chaos in the velodrome – for the best climbers. It’s a freak show of an event that might as well be ridden in clown suits on children’s bicycles.

So, Jan, when you joke about getting it on with podium girls you’re just feeding into the kind of institutionalised sexism that has long been a feature of cycling. It’s time to stop treating women riders like performing animals and stop objectifying women race staff. Women riders are professional athletes and women race staff are professional employees. Your daughters will thank you for it.

Andre Cardoso has been suspended by his Trek-Segafredo team after testing positive for Erythropoietin (EPO) during an out-of-competition test this month.

The Portuguese rider who was scheduled to start the Tour de France, which starts in Düsseldorf, Germany, on Sunday in support of Alberto Contador, was suspended with immediate effect by his team who released a short statement on Tuesday evening and then later replaced him with Haimar Zubeldia.

"To our cycling family, we have some disappointing news to share," the statement said. "It is with deep disappointment that we have just learned that our rider, Andre Cardoso, has tested positive for a prohibited substance. In accordance with our zero tolerance policy, he has been suspended immediately.

Mo Farah was apparently​ suspected of doping on one occasion by an expert enlisted by the IAAF, the athletics world governing body, after his biological passport flagged up unusual results.

But the documents suggest the International Association of Athletics Federations was later satisfied that the four-times Olympic champion was running clean after further testing. The athlete biological passport (ABP) was introduced in 2009 by the IAAF and is a next-generation test, analysing results over a period of time for the effects rather than presence of drugs.

He gets knocked down ... but Mo Farah gets back up again to win 10,000m gold Read more

The latest leak from the Russian hackers Fancy Bears has revealed what appears to be an email from Pierre-Yves Garnier, a senior doctor in the IAAF’s anti-doping department, to Kyle Barber, an IAAF out-of-competition testing coordinator and Thomas Capdevielle, a senior anti-doping manager at the organisation.

The IAAF said on Wednesday night it was investigating the leak but that the email and the attached documents were likely to have been stolen in a cyber-attack in April. “We are looking into this. It does appear to be information from the cyber-attack which the IAAF announced on 3 April, 2017 had taken place,” a spokesman told the Guardian.

Farah is listed in two spreadsheets attached to the email, which appears to list a number of names of athletes next to their ABP results.

In one file, beside the 34-year-old’s name and under the headline “hematological expert opinion” is the comment: “Likely doping; Passport suspicious: further data is required.” That assessment was apparently based on the results of testing over an extended period of time with the last test having been done on 23 November, 2015. A second database, attached to an email dated April 2016, however, records “now flagged as normal with the last sample”.

The email from April 2016 appears to put Farah in the clear, with Garnier stating he was one of two athletes previously under suspicion whose ABP results “very recently became ‘normal’”. Farah has always vociferously denied ever taking performance enhancing drugs.

A spokesperson for Farah said on Wednesday night: “It has been widely reported that previous leaks from this organisation have included false or altered documents, and we have asked the IAAF to urgently look into the validity.

“Regardless, any suggestion of misconduct is entirely false and seriously misleading. Mo Farah has been subject to many blood tests during his career and has never failed a single one. We have never been informed of any of Mo’s test results being outside of the legal parameters set by the relevant authorities, nor has Mo ever been contacted by the IAAF about any individual result. It is totally incorrect and defamatory to suggest otherwise, and we will pursue any claims to the contrary through all necessary legal routes.”

Alberto Salazar, Farah’s coach since 2011, remains under investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency and this probe is believed to be reaching its conclusion. A leaked interim Usada report was also put into the public domain earlier this year by the Fancy Bears hackers, a group believed to be motivated by revenge for the way in which systemic state-sponsored doping in Russia was uncovered.

The report suggested the Cuban-born Salazar had failed to establish a valid reason for possessing testosterone and committed “unlawful” behaviour by rubbing a gel containing the banned substance on his sons. The report also raised “suspicions and concerns” about Salazar’s practice of giving Galen Rupp, Farah’s training partner, massages before big races, despite Nike employing massage therapists. Salazar has denied any wrongdoing.

Salazar has always maintained his innocence, and issued a ferocious 12,000-word rebuttal to many of the allegations against him in 2015. In March, when the full leaked Usada report emerged, he released a statement which said: “I have clearly and repeatedly refuted allegations directed against me and the Oregon Project. I believe in a clean sport and a methodical, dedicated, approach to training. The Oregon Project will never permit doping.”

In April, the IAAF confirmed it had been the victim of a “cyber-attack” by ​the Fancy Bears in​ February and said it had called in security experts from Monaco and the UK to shut down the attack.

At the time, the IAAF said it looked like the Fancy Bears were trying to access the database on which it stored its therapeutic use exemption (TUE) records - the doctors’ notes which allow athletes to use medication which would be otherwise banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).

This was the same tactic the group used to reveal that Sir Bradley Wiggins was given permission to use a powerful corticosteroid before his three biggest races in 2011, 2012 and 2013, including his 2012 Tour de France win.

A statement issued on Wiggins’s behalf at the time said: “There’s nothing new here. Everyone knows Brad suffers from asthma, his medical treatment is British Cycling and International Cycling Union approved and like all Team GB athletes he follows Wada regulations to the letter.”

Gold medals never come easy, but Mo Farah’s third was harder than most. First Farah fell, and then he found himself in a fierce final sprint with Kenya’s Paul Tanui. Farah won in 27min 05.17sec, and by a little less than half a second. Afterwards, of course, we saw that familiar grin, and were treated to the Mobot all over again. But in the press conference that followed the medal ceremony Farah faced a hard question about his association with the Somalian coach Jama Aden, who was arrested by the Spanish police on doping charges last June. At the time British Athletics explained that Aden had worked as an “unofficial facilitator” for Farah in 2015, and that all he had done was “hold a stopwatch”. Four years on from the London Olympics, the atmosphere is different now.

A journalist wanted to know why Farah, as a clean athlete, kept such associations. He asked about a photo of him and Aden together. “Obviously it is a small sport,” Farah said. “There are so many athletes who compete, so getting pictures with someone who asks you to take a picture, you’re not going to say no, are you? It doesn’t mean I’ve trained with him.”

Farah continued “Obviously I believe in clean sport and we’ve got to do what we can, but at the same time you can only control yourself.”

Jessica Ennis-Hill to decide on future after claiming silver in heptathlon Read more

It left a sour note, but Farah shouldn’t be immune to interrogation any more than any other athlete. The truth is that a lot of winners here will face their own versions of these questions in the next week. That’s the the sorry state the sport is in.

Back to Farah’s achievement, then, on a night when there was no repeat of London’s Super Saturday as Jessica Ennis-Hill and Greg Rutherford couldn’t quite match their 2012 golds, settling for heptathlon silver and long jump bronze respectively. Farah is the sixth man to win two Olympic 10,000m titles, following on from Paavo Nurmi, Emil Zátopek, Lasse Virén, Haile Gebrselassie and Kenenisa Bekele. If he wasn’t there already, Farah now ranks high in his sport’s hall of fame. If he wins the 5,000m next week, he will be only the second man, after Virén, to win both Olympic titles twice. Virén famously fell too, when he won the 10,000m for the first time in 1972. He got tangled up with Emiel Puttemans, but got back to his feet and hared back into the race. Which is exactly what Farah did, 44 years later.

For ten laps, Farah barely seemed to stretch his legs. He waved to his family in the stands as he came around the second bend, then coasted at the very back of the pack right through the first 1,000m, thinking it the safest place to be. Soon after he decided to make a move, and slid past the field so he could lurk behind the frontrunners. The American runner Galen Rupp was just behind him. And that’s when it happened. “There was a lot of pushing,” said Rupp, “guys slowing down in front of him.” They collided, and Farah tumbled down to the ground as another runner hurdled over him. For an awful moment, it looked like his race was over.

Farah rolled, regained his feet, and regathered his pace. “When I fell I was just thinking ‘try and get back as fast as I can’,” Farah said. “I was thinking ‘don’t panic, don’t panic, don’t panic’.” Rupp helped. “I wanted to make sure that he was OK first and foremost,” Rupp said, so he turned back and shouted out. Farah flashed a thumb up. He was grateful to Rupp, “he is a great sportsman”. Rupp then told him “just get behind me” and they set off again, Farah asking himself “is the race done? Is the race done? No, no, no.” Farah explained that he had promised his daughter Rihanna a medal “and I wasn’t going to let her down”.

“If it happened with five laps to go I think the race would have been over,” Farah said. But he had time to recover. And besides, it all happened so quickly that there was hardly time for the other runners up front to realise what had happened. He was desperately worried that they would spot the chance to and accelerate away. “I was hoping the guys didn’t see me fall at the front,” he said. The three Kenyans, Tanui, Bedan Muchri, and Geoffrey Kamworor did hit the front in a bunch, but by then Farah was already up on their heels. They tried to block him off, but eventually split, and Ethiopia’s Yigram Demalesh took the race on into the final few laps.

Greg Rutherford wins long jump bronze but says medal is a bitter pill Read more

Virén once said that “it is the mental side which can be the deciding factor” in any race. He liked to a Finnish word, sisu, which has no exact translation in English, but which he defined as “the ability to endure and overcome any pain and challenge through mental strength”. Farah may not know it, but he showed it. His mental strength comes from his faith in his kick over the last 400m, when all the biomechanical work he has done with Alberto Salazar really starts to show. Salazar taught Farah how to increase the number of steps he takes without cutting down his long stride, which eats up two-and-a-quarter metres of track. That gives him an edge over everyone else. He knows it, and so do they.

In full flow Farah looks such a natural, but his technique has in fact been calibrated with scientific precision. He lands on the balls of his feet, places his front foot precisely beneath his knee so that he keeps his centre of balance, and quickly whips his trailing leg up towards his back to cut the distance that it has to travel before it’s ready for its next stride. That’s why Farah can fly. Tanui tried to take him on. He took the lead at the bell and kept it for much of the final lap. But Farah pulled up to him and then kicked on again coming around the last bend. He last lost a major championship race at the World Championships in 2011. They’ve been trying to find a way to beat him for five years now, and they still haven’t done it.

• This article was amended on 15 August 2016. An earlier version said the Finnish word susi could be defined as “the ability to endure and overcome any pain and challenge through mental strength”. That word is sisu.

Highland Acclaim is the nap in the most valuable race (7.15) on the evening card at Epsom while Lunar Deity is the next best at Yarmouth (2.50)

Epsom Downs racecourse makes a mark on the wider sporting public’s consciousness on one day each year but there are few better places to be on a fine summer evening than the home of the Derby, which stages a low-key six-race card on Thursday evening.

As ever at this track, course form is a significant point in favour of any runner and Highland Acclaim (7.15) is consolidating his position at the top of the market for the most valuable race on the card after his main market rival, Major Pusey, was scratched on the morning of the race.

Musselburgh meetings may be scrapped due to bitter internal row Read more

David O’Meara’s gelding has gone 13 starts without a win since his success from a mark of 87 over Thursday’s course and distance last August. He raced off a mark in the 90s after that victory but is now back to 85 and showed definite signs of a return to his best form when second, in a good time, at Thirsk last time out. That was his first start in a hood since July 2016 and if it has a similar effect today, a price of around 5-2 looks very fair.

Silver Ghost (7.50) has yet to experience Epsom’s gradients but he ran well at Goodwood, another downland course, last time out, and has only eight runs behind him to date, so should still have some progress to come. Only the latest three of those runs were for his in-form current trainer, Eve Johnson Houghton, and he has obvious prospects of becoming her third winner from only a handful of runners this month.

Elsewhere, Lunar Deity (2.50) could complete a hat-trick when he lines up for the one-mile handicap at Yarmouth, where he romped home by 10 lengths in mid-June. Himalayan Queen (3.20) is fairly priced at around 100-30 later on the same card, while Our Man In Havana (3.00) could go well at decent odds in the first nursery handicap of the season at Haydock.

It used to be said that a trainer who felt there were several potential Derby winners in the stable did not in truth have even one. But not any more. Aidan O’Brien once sent eight horses to the Classic and left Epsom empty-handed but his six-strong team on Saturday produced a 40-1 winner in Wings Of Eagles, a colt with just a handful of backers among the countless thousands crammed on to the Downs.

The victory of Wings Of Eagles was the biggest surprise in the Derby since Snow Knight’s success at 50-1 in 1974, and the first for a horse at a double-figure price since High-Rise at 20-1 in 1998. On the day, however, there was no fluke about it, and while Wings Of Eagles and Padraig Beggy hit the front only a few strides from the line, they won a shade cosily in the end.

There were echoes of Pour Moi’s charge through the field to victory in 2011 as his son Wings Of Eagles passed horse after horse in the Epsom straight, building momentum all the time and closing steadily on the leaders. Two furlongs out, though, most eyes were glued to his stable companion, Cliffs Of Moher, and O’Brien’s principal jockey Ryan Moore, as they glided past market rival Cracksman and into a useful lead.

The stage was set for Cliffs Of Moher to stride clear but he simply stayed on without quickening as the race reached its climax, as Wings Of Eagles and Beggy chased them down and claimed victory by three-quarters of a length.

Before the race, some might have questioned O’Brien’s apparent wish to run almost every three-year-old colt with a pulse in Saturday’s Classic. A few minutes later, the wisdom of covering every possible base was unarguable, as Wings Of Eagles fulfilled the promise in his pedigree, which has the family of the 1995 Derby winner Lammtarra on his dam’s side to complement Pour Moi.

This was O’Brien’s fourth Derby success in the last six years and his sixth in all, one more than Sir Michael Stoute’s (current) total of five between 1981 and 2010, and just one behind the all-time record of seven wins in the Classic. All three of the trainers to saddle seven winners – Robert Robson, John Porter and Fred Darling – were active in a much less competitive era, and sent out their final Derby winners in 1823, 1899 and 1941 respectively. O’Brien, though, is closing in and seems sure to catch and pass them all before too many more seasons are out.

The trainer made it clear that Wings Of Eagles had been seen as a possible winner beforehand, despite his starting price and a defeat at the hands of Venice Beach, who finished 12th, on his previous start at Chester. That said, he may still suspect that Cliffs Of Moher will prove to be a better horse in the long term.

“He was working very well and we were delighted with him at Chester,” O’Brien said. “Padraig was always going to take his time on him and produce him and he gave him a marvellous ride.”

He added of Cliffs Of Moher: “I was delighted with the second horse. All those really well-bred, good-looking horses, they can make dramatic improvement from race to race, and we knew that they had all improved [from their trial runs].

“I didn’t really know what was going to happen. I thought Ryan’s horse was open to the most improvement, which he was and he did, but Ryan said he got there and he just got tired in his hands. I was half-afraid that that could happen, but we’d just about made the race. If he hadn’t run at Chester, he wouldn’t have made it here. He came with his long, sustained run and in the last 100 yards it just told, the lack of preparation.”

Michael Tabor, a former bookmaker and one of the co-owners of Wings Of Eagles in John Magnier’s Coolmore Stud syndicate, said that he had felt before the race that any one of their six runners could make the step up to win. “We knew Wings Of Eagles was in the mix, but no more than that,” Tabor said. “He’s proved to be a very, very good horse for the future but I’m afraid I didn’t back him and I didn’t have a bet in the race.”

The betting suggested beforehand that this was one of the most open Derbys for years but the fact that a 40-1 chance crossed the line in front does not necessarily mean that it was a sub-par renewal. That will become apparent only in his remaining starts, but however his career plays out, Wings Of Eagles and Beggy are Derby winners, and nothing will ever change that.

“It’s always nice to see Sarah Taylor playing with a smile on her face,” said a beaming Tammy Beaumont. Those at Bristol will be inclined to say the same of her. For it was those two who smashed South Africa all over the County Ground, with a century apiece, as England defeated South Africa by 68 runs for their third win of the Women’s World Cup.

Collectively they were record-breaking: their 275 for the second wicket is England’s highest ODI stand and the second highest of all time. Individually they were breathtaking, taking full advantage of winning the toss and batting on a fresh, true pitch and, for the first time in this competition, with pace on the ball.

England beat South Africa by 68 runs: Women's Cricket World Cup – live! Read more

Taylor, player of the match, unfurled the best of her six ODI hundreds. She was unplayable: a career best of 147 set with the ease and splendour of a Sunday stroll. The half-century came off 49 balls before the reverse sweeps and pick-ups to midwicket came out, ensuring she only had to wait 31 more deliveries for three figures . At that point, she flicked a switch: five fours in a row came off the next over (the 40th) from Shabnim Ismail, the quickest bowler around. Coupled with her unbeaten 74 last time out against Sri Lanka, it is safe to say she is back in business.

Beaumont’s century is another problem solved. Scores of 14, 14 and 12 to start the tournament were scratchy, out on all three occasions trying to force the issue. Crucially here she did not snatch at deliveries and with good carry from the surface, she could play her natural game (as encouraged to do so by her head coach Mark Robinson on the eve of this match).

That is not to say she was sedate. In the same overs that Taylor would hit straight, Beaumont lapped and dabbed behind square: seven of her 22 fours coming behind the keeper as South Africa failed to keep tabs on what these two would do next. A scoop away through fine leg took her to three figures from 118 balls before, like Taylor, she used the milestone to cut loose. Her final 47 runs came in 28 balls, which included England’s only six.

It is worth taking a moment to consider Beaumont’s last 12 months. The first of her now three ODI centuries was scored in June of last year and this knock, in her 32nd innings, took her past 1,000 runs in the format, making her the fourth fastest Englishwoman to four figures. Considering she only had 207 from her first 16 innings, her turnaround has been remarkable.

A 10-ball 22 from the captain, Heather Knight, including 10 from the final over, pushed England to 373.

South Africa’s approach throughout was commendable. An impressive opening stand between Lizelle Lee and the 18-year-old Laura Wolvaardt put on 128, but it could have been curtailed earlier had England taken one of four chances to catch Lee, dropped on 15, 37, 40 and 61 before she was bowled by Nat Sciver for 72.

Once Wolvaardt was out in the 33rd over, with 207 more needed from 105 balls, it seemed England could rest easy. The No6 Chloe Tryon looked to change that with a flashy half-century off 25 balls thanks to four huge sixes – two of them in a row off Dani Hazell before she was caught at midwicket by Knight. With that South Africa’s challenge effectively ended, and they finished on 305 for nine.

That meant it became the first women’s ODI in which both teams made it past 300. The 678 aggregate is a record for runs scored in a women’s ODI, moreover, beating the previous best by 101.

The result moves England above South Africa, into third. Their opponents on Sunday, Australia, lead the group after a 159-run win against Pakistan in Leicester. Despite missing their captain, Meg Lanning, they recovered from seven for two to post 290, with half-centuries from Ellyse Perry, Elyse Villani and Alyssa Healy. India, in second place, also made it four wins from four, albeit in tighter circumstances, as Sri Lanka fell 16 short of their target of 233 at Derby.

This week’s roundup also features Tour de France crashes, deflated All Blacks and terrifying footage at the UCI Mountain Bike World Cup

1) Summer in England has officially started as of today, because Test cricket is here. England face South Africa at Lord’s. The last time these two sides met in this format, England were the tourists in 2015-16, where Stuart Broad took 6-17 in Johannesburg, including a preposterous spell of five wickets for one run, to cap a series win. That tour was also notable for Ben Stokes’s remarkable innings of 258 – the quickest 250 in Test history and the highest score by a No6 batsman – and Kagiso Rabada’s 13 wickets for 144 runs in South Africa’s 280 run victory over England in the final Test.

2) After the All Blacks’ first home defeat in eight years, you’d probably think of staying out of the post-match New Zealand dressing room. But this video goes to show what sort of a captain Kieran Read is, going round to individually shake every one of his team-mates’ hands, and then giving a humble, composed interview. What an occasion the decisive Test match on Saturday promises to be.

3) You may have missed the latest race of the Mountain Bike World Cup in Andorra, where Troy Brosnan won the elite men’s downhill race by just 0.22 seconds, equivalent to about a five-foot margin, ahead of Greg Minnaar. Danny Hart took third in what was probably the wildest, if not the quickest, run of the day: check out the first-person footage from that one.

4) Internazionale’s Ivan Perisic is reportedly in trouble for playing professional volleyball, losing to Brazilian duo Alvaro Morais Filho and Saymon Barbosa Santos as part of a Croatia team with Niksa Dell’Orco. He lost to the Brazilian team in straight sets, 21-10, 21-10. In other footballers playing the wrong sport news, Paolo Maldini – all 49 years of him – has ventured into professional tennis. Here he is in the orange, losing heavily 6-1, 6-1 to Poland’s Tomasz Bednarek and Dutchman David Pel in a doubles match on the ATP Challenger circuit, in a match that lasted just 42 minutes.

5) Peter Sagan has been kicked off the Tour de France after his involvement in a nasty crash with Mark Cavendish on stage two on Tuesday. It is two years to the day since a massive crash involving 20 riders on the 2015 Tour, which forced six competitors – some travelling at over 50mph – to withdraw from the race due to injury.

Lacazette arrives from Lyon with an impressive scoring record and can pretty much do it all – apart from dominate in the air. Can Olivier Giroud’s deputy for France provide a title-winning upgrade?

Alexandre Lacazette has the numbers to press his case. Across eight seasons at Lyon the striker scored 100 goals in 203 Ligue 1 appearances and there were a further 29 in the cups and Europe. The supporters of his boyhood club will remember the spectacular ones, and there were a number of those, but each was marked by a particular brand of precision and ruthlessness.

They have led Lacazette to an extremely big number because never before have Arsenal paid so much for a player. The 26-year-old’s transfer fee could rise as high as €60m (£52.7m) if all of the add-ons are met.

Alexandre Lacazette joins Arsenal for club record fee of £52.7m Read more

Yet, as Lacazette prepares to step into the Emirates madhouse, it distills into a single issue for him. Can he make the difference for Arsenal in their quest for a first Premier League title since 2004? Or, to put it another way, does he have the world-class quality to do so?

It might seem like a black-and-white way of considering the principal aspect of his challenge but, then again, it has long been the championship or bust for Arsène Wenger in terms of vindicating the second part of his long tenure.

Arsenal have craved a top centre-forward for some time or, at least, since Robin van Persie left for Manchester United in 2012 and Olivier Giroud came in from Montpellier. Yes, Alexis Sánchez is a world-class player and he played as the No9 for plenty of last season. But, by the end, Wenger had returned him to his roaming brief off the flank and the manager said that he preferred him there. It was Giroud who finished at the tip of the formation.

Giroud has been a lightning rod for the fans’ frustrations and the consensus on him is he is a very good centre-forward, who is capable of flashes of inspiration. His scorpion kick against Crystal Palace on New Year’s Day was one of the best goals of last season and there have been other crackers, including the sumptuous touch and finish against West Ham United in April 2014.

But Giroud is not world class and he has been damned by the perception he is not quite good enough; that he is not the player to help Arsenal become the best in England.

Can Lacazette be that man? Is he the upgrade on Giroud that even Wenger – through deeds rather than words – has indicated he has needed? Wenger tried and failed to sign Luis Suárez from Liverpool in 2013, following Giroud’s first season in north London and then there was the Sánchez experiment up front last season.

The curious thing is that Lacazette has been nowhere near Didier Deschamps’ starting France team whereas Giroud has come to be the manager’s preferred foil for Antoine Griezmann. When Deschamps introduced Lacazette as a 73rd-minute substitute against Paraguay on 2 June, it was his first international involvement since October 2015. He came on for Giroud, who had scored a hat-trick.

Deschamps gave Lacazette the first of his 11 caps against Uruguay in June 2013 but has started him in only three games and did not name him in his squad for the World Cup in 2014 or Euro 2016 – when Giroud was a key player.

Deschamps would say his preference for Giroud ought not to be taken as a slight to Lacazette. They are different types of No9 – Giroud the old-fashioned hold-up man; Lacazette the more mobile predator. For the balance of the team and the way Deschamps wants to play, he has considered Giroud to be the solution.

It might also be pointed out that Deschamps has an excess of riches up front, with his other choices including Kylian Mbappé, Kévin Gameiro, Kingsley Coman, Anthony Martial and Ousmane Dembélé. And that is before Karim Benzema is factored in. Benzema is technically available for selection having been dropped for Euro 2016 after he was questioned by police in connection to an alleged blackmail attempt against his then France team-mate Mathieu Valbuena. It seems unlikely that Benzema will return while Deschamps is in charge.

It has, nevertheless, been possible to feel Deschamps has not fully trusted Lacazette; that he has been sceptical about whether the player possesses the requisite class. There has also been the view that Lacazette may be more effective as an impact substitute for France, which can impact negatively on a player’s psyche.

Lacazette has been at the top of the game in Ligue 1 for the past three years and there are those in Lyon who think that the 2014-15 season was his best one, when he formed an irrepressible partnership with Nabil Fekir, a touch player, who shares certain qualities with Mesut Özil. Lacazette scored 27 league goals that season and 31 overall but most believe it was last season when he took his football to the next level and changed people’s perceptions.

The numbers were startling: 28 league goals in 30 appearances and 37 in 45 matches in all competitions. Previously, he had been criticised for going missing in the biggest games; now, he rose to them. Wenger was convinced and the call-up from Deschamps for the end-of-season fixtures against Paraguay, Sweden and England was interpreted as a sign he had been won over. On the other hand, Deschamps had named a bigger squad than usual because of the number of matches and he did not use Lacazette against Sweden or England, when he once again started with Giroud.

Premier League transfers club by club: done deals, targets and likely departures Read more

Lacazette’s hold-up work improved greatly last season and Arsenal are getting a striker who can pretty much do it all – apart from dominate in the air. A converted right winger, he can play off the No9 as well as in the No9 role and he is defined by his movement off the ball, work rate, pace and technique, as well as by his goal instinct. He loves to get into the box with little one-twos and the comparison that has done the rounds in English football circles has been to Ian Wright. More fleet of foot than Giroud, he will bring a different dimension to Wenger’s formation, whether it be 4-2-3-1, 4-3-3 or the 3-4-2-1 seen in April and May.

Arsenal’s purchase of Lacazette has been underpinned by realism. Would it have been realistic to have pushed for Monaco’s Mbappé or, say, Álvaro Morata at Real Madrid? Who else is out there? And Wenger’s need has been extreme to the point of desperate.

Lacazette’s detractors say if he were world class, he would have left Lyon two or three years ago and they also argue his statistics have been inflated by the number of penalties he has scored. Of his 129 goals in all competitions for Lyon, 23 came from the spot. Hence the unkind nickname “Penalzette”. Physically, it will be interesting to see how he copes with the Premier League and one thing is very clear – the pressure on him will be huge, particularly if Sánchez is prised away and the team have to replace his goals and assists.

Does Lacazette have the x-factor? Can he bring it to Arsenal? All eyes are on him.

Labour leader to tour Tory marginal seats in preparation for any potential collapse of Theresa May’s minority government

Jeremy Corbyn has told buoyant Labour MPs that he will visit at least 65 Conservative marginal seats in preparation for the possible collapse of the Tory minority government and urged them to be a “government in waiting”.



The Labour leader said Theresa May’s premiership had no mandate or legitimacy at the first meeting of the parliamentary party since Thursday’s election, and was praised by a succession of speakers for cutting the Tories’ majority.

The scenes took place in the same select committee corridor in the House of Commons where he has previously been booed and heckled by colleagues concerned that Labour would be wiped out by May. On Tuesday, the Labour leader was greeted with a standing ovation, desk-banging and cheers before being praised for running a principled campaign.

May strikes conciliatory tone as Corbyn gently mocks her 'coalition of chaos' Read more

He told MPs: “So now the election is over, the next phase of our campaign to win power for the majority has already begun. We must remain in permanent campaign mode on a general election footing.

“We achieved what we did last Thursday because we were a united party during the campaign and we need to maintain that unity and collective discipline in the weeks and months ahead.

“We will continue to take the fight to the Tories and I will be out campaigning around the country in Conservative marginals in those extra seats we need to gain to deliver the government for the many that almost 13 million people voted for last week.”

The MP for Islington North praised party workers and supporters for a remarkable result.

“Last Thursday, we turned the tables on Theresa May’s gamble and gained seats in every region and nation of Britain and I’m particularly delighted that we have increased our representation in Scotland.

“We increased the Labour vote by the largest margin in any election since 1945 and gained seats as a party for the first time since 1997.”

“Now as parliament returns, we have a government in complete disarray still unable to reach an agreement, it seems, with the DUP and desperately delaying the Queen’s speech and Brexit negotiations.

“Far from being strong and stable, the government Theresa May is putting together is weak, wobbly and out of control. This is a government on notice.

“Theresa May has no mandate and no legitimacy for policies that do not have the support of the majority of the British people.”

Corbyn also told MPs he wanted to learn lessons why they lost in some areas, and said he would be meeting candidates who lost their seats.

Tom Watson, the party’s deputy leader, was cheered when he said that former SNP leader Alex Salmond’s defeat in Banff was the “Portillo moment of the night”, referring to former Tory defence minister Michael Portillo’s defeat by relatively unknown Labour candidate Stephen Twigg in the 1997 election.

Former ministers and shadow ministers heaped praise upon Corbyn. Chuka Umunna, the former shadow business secretary, said: “Unity is the watchword, government is our aim.”

Another MP said: “He has performed a minor miracle, we have to give him time.”

However, one MP said that some in Labour are “keeping their powder dry” by biting their tongues. “Not everyone has bought in to Jeremy. But this is his moment.”

Labour’s hopes of unseating the Tories from power are now within its grasp if a general election is called within the next two years, according to Guardian analysis of the new electoral landscape.

Analysis of the new marginal seats shows that a swing of just 1.63% to Labour would deliver the 34 gains that Jeremy Corbyn needs to make it the largest party in the Commons.

Last Thursday’s general election left 22 Tory MPs sitting on majorities of less than 1,000. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, is now defending a majority of 346 in Hastings and Rye, while the former Northern Ireland secretary, Theresa Villiers, has been similarly left defending a majority of 353 in Chipping Barnet.

Labour leader ignores prominent MPs who signalled they were willing to return, including Angela Eagle and Dan Jarvis

Jeremy Corbyn has appointed an array of new MPs to frontbench Labour jobs as well as handing junior roles to recognisable names such as former shadow cabinet minister Gloria De Piero and Tracy Brabin, who replaced the murdered MP Jo Cox.

Two of Corbyn’s choices who were only elected in June are former MEPs Anneliese Dodds as shadow Treasury minister and Afzal Khan, who becomes shadow Home Office minister. Paul Sweeney, one of Labour’s new MPs in Scotland, becomes shadow Scotland minister.

De Piero, who was shadow minister for women and equalities in Ed Miliband’s shadow cabinet but quit as a shadow junior minister before the leadership challenge to Corbyn last summer, has a new role as shadow justice minister.



Brabin, who won Cox’s Batley and Spen seat in a 2016 byelection after the MP was murdered by a far-right attacker, has been made a shadow education minister.

The York MP, Rachael Maskell, who was shadow environment secretary but quit Corbyn’s shadow cabinet to vote against the triggering of article 50, has been given a new junior transport role.

There are also jobs for MPs who are returning to parliament after previously stepping down or losing their seats in 2015.

Chris Williamson, the MP for Derby North who has been one of the Labour leader’s most vocal champions, is made a shadow fire services minister, having won back his seat, which was snatched by the Conservatives in 2015.

Ian Lavery, the Labour party chair, said Williamson’s appointment signalled the death knell of Thatcherism. “He has a reputation as being no fan of neoliberalism and his appointment is a sign that the days of free-market Thatcherism are coming to an end.”

Tony Lloyd, the former Stretford MP who stepped down to become Greater Manchester police and crime commissioner and was later beaten by Andy Burnham for the nomination to be Greater Manchester mayor, has been made a shadow housing minister. He won the seat of Rochdale after Simon Danczuk was deselected.



Chris Ruane and David Drew, who also both regained seats at this election, have junior posts in the shadow Wales and shadow Defra teams respectively. Other MPs in new roles include Melanie Onn, the former shadow deputy leader of the House of Commons, who joins Lloyd as a new shadow housing minister.

In a statement announcing the appointments, Corbyn said the frontbench had a “wealth of talent” from both new and longer-serving MPs.

“Our new shadow ministers will bolster the excellent work of Labour’s shadow cabinet and departmental teams,” he said. “These appointments are further evidence that Labour is not just the opposition – we are the government in waiting.”

However, apart from De Piero’s appointment and the return of his former leadership rival Owen Smith to the shadow cabinet last week in the Northern Ireland post, Corbyn has shown little enthusiasm so far for bringing back any of his critics into plum posts, preferring to reward allies or promote backbenchers.

A number of prominent MPs who served on the shadow frontbench under Miliband and Corbyn before the leadership challenge, including Angela Eagle and Dan Jarvis, had indicated they would be willing to return to the frontbench. None have been appointed in the latest round of jobs.

The party has been broadly united in public since the general election, though shaken over the weekend by Corbyn’s sacking of shadow ministers who defied the party whip to vote in favour of an amendment to the Queen’s speech brought by Chuka Umunna, committing to keeping the UK in the single market after Brexit.

Lavery also angered some MPs by suggesting that the party was “too broad a church” and that the process for MP selection should be reformed. MPs at the party’s weekly meeting of backbenchers on Monday night expressed frustration at the comments. One MP said there was “real anger” among backbenchers who had come back from a gruelling election campaign.

“People are very unhappy,” one former shadow minister said. “It’s divisive and threatening and Corbyn can’t let this stuff go on. I can’t recall anyone in a position of leadership ever saying anything like this.”

Lavery, a former miner who replaced the deputy leader, Tom Watson, as party chair after the election, said he did not have “the divine right to be an MP for Wansbeck … I’ve got to work very hard on behalf of every single member of that constituency. He told the Huffington Post: “Everything is going to be reviewed. That’s the point I am making.”

Labour’s national executive committee will meet for the first time since the election in the next fortnight and one source close to the NEC said they believed Lavery’s comments would be a controversial topic of discussion – particularly on narrowing the spectrum of political views in the party.

“I can’t imagine the NEC being overly pleased with those kinds of comments. If you decide that a party is too broad a church, you have to then announce who you are going to kick out,” the source said. “To narrow the church further, you’re only going to go backwards.”

Serco used to be the biggest company you had never heard of. For three decades it grew in the borderlands between the state and society, the government and us. Its name stands for “service company” and Serco, which combined great ambition with a desire to be unseen, wanted to be everywhere and nowhere at the same time. It was as much a formula as a company: a way to implement outsourced public services on behalf of governments, but with the elan of a restless entrepreneur. It didn’t matter what the service was, where it had to happen, or to whom it was delivered. Serco started out operating radars in Yorkshire and traffic lights in London, but it came to work with schoolchildren and doctors, commuters and prisoners, pilots and refugees. It was designed to be limitless, and to grow for ever. At its peak, Serco had a workforce of 125,000, contracts on four continents, and revenues of £5bn. But in 2013, the formula faltered. Everybody heard about Serco, and the roof fell in.

The trouble started in the spring. A young civil servant, a fast-streamer in the Ministry of Justice, noticed strange numbers in the documents submitted by Serco and G4S (another large outsourcing company) as the firms prepared to renew two electronic tagging contracts that they held with the British government. Since 2005, the two companies had earned around £700m from monitoring thousands of criminals, suspects and recently released convicts via tracking devices attached to their ankles – a practice introduced by the Home Office to reduce prison costs in 1999. But according to the junior civil servant, whose findings were initially dismissed, they were overcharging the state.

The paperwork that embodies government outsourcing, the physical contracts themselves, tells you a lot about how vexatious the whole business is. Capturing exactly what the state wants done on its behalf – the running of a railway system, the rehabilitation of prisoners – can produce dizzying piles of paper for even mundane tasks. The government chivvies its contractors to do a thousand things correctly. Private companies seek to minimise their risks, and ensure a quiet profit at the end of the day. Everyone covers their arse furiously. The documents that emerge are hundreds of pages long, dense with KPIs (key performance indicators) and SLAs (service level agreements) and kept secret from the customers – us, the public – whom they are supposed to benefit. Once they are signed, they are rarely looked at again.

Can Winston Churchill’s grandson save Serco? And is it worth saving? - Podcast Read more

For the tagging contracts, it was decided that it was up to the crown, and not G4S or Serco, to decide when individuals should be fitted with a tag. This made sense, but it gave rise to an aberration. The companies came to regard monitoring cases as open or closed on the basis of letters they received from the courts and prisons, rather than anything to do with the physical fitting or taking off of tags. They billed the state until they had a document telling them not to, even if the subjects had died, disappeared or were no longer wearing a tag. G4S’s computers were set to continue billing to 2020; Serco’s to the year 3000.

Over the years, letters got lost, notifications were not followed up, and these cases accreted. No one checked the contract. Serco charged the Ministry of Justice £15,500 for five years of monitoring a suspect they never managed to locate in the first place. When the anomalies came to light in 2013, they showed that the companies had invoiced the taxpayer for millions of pounds’ worth of nonexistent work. “You are charging us for people who are dead,” as one Cabinet Office official involved in the subsequent showdown told me. “I don’t care if the contract says you can, it is a wrong thing.” Serco and G4S were banned from bidding on new government work for six months, while investigations into their other contracts were carried out. The Serious Fraud Office got involved.

The revelations hit Serco particularly hard. The British central government provides a quarter of its global revenues. The idea that the company was ripping off its most important customer – “the goose that laid the golden egg”, as Serco executives sometimes called it – panicked investors. The share price slid. Then, in late August, the Ministry of Justice announced that the police were looking into “potentially fraudulent behaviour” on a second Serco contract: this time a £285m deal to transport prisoners to and from court in London and East Anglia.

A sense of crisis enveloped the company. Investors, politicians and the press connected what had previously been isolated controversies – in 2012 Tthe Guardian revealed that Serco had altered statistics and mismanaged an out-of-hours healthcare contract in Cornwall – into a pattern of failures and dishonesty. For those already suspicious of Britain’s outsourcing complex, Serco came to represent everything that was wrong with it: anonymous, omnipresent, and playing us all for fools. In the space of five months, £500m was wiped from the company’s stock market value. On 23 October, Chris Hyman, the company’s chief executive – a charismatic South African who had been at Serco since it was founded – resigned. “The best way for the company to move forward,” he said, “is for me to step back.” (Hyman did not respond to requests for comment .)

Internally, Serco reeled. The company had always exuded a moral confidence that was unusual in an industry best known for cost-cutting. Hyman was an evangelical Christian. He tithed, donating part of his salary to his local Pentecostal church, and fasted once a week. Employees were rewarded for “living Serco’s values” and managers were given “commitments” rather than budgets or financial targets to meet each year. The tagging scandal cast all that in doubt. “Serco’s ethical compass needed to be reoriented,” said Alastair Lyons, the company’s chairman at the time, who was in charge of finding Hyman’s successor. Over the course of the winter, the board came to believe that they had found the man to do it, and on February 28 2014, Serco appointed its new chief executive, Rupert Soames, on a pay package worth more than £2m a year.

Soames, who is 56, is regarded as one of Britain’s most capable businessmen. Before taking the job at Serco, he ran a Scottish company called Aggreko that makes diesel generators and supplies temporary power projects around the world. Soames joined Aggreko in 2003, after its previous chief executive was killed in a car crash, and led the firm through an impressive decade of growth, during which its profits, sales and workforce had multiplied many times over.

Whether he likes it or not, however, Soames also stands for something else. Choosing him was an opportunity for Serco to revive itself at the well of the British establishment. Soames’s eldest brother is Sir Nicholas Soames, a former Conservative defence minister. His father was Sir Christopher Soames, an ambassador to France and the last governor of Rhodesia. His mother, Mary, learned to swear while commanding an anti-aircraft battery in Hyde Park during the blitz. His grandfather was Winston Churchill.

Merely being around Soames – who is bulky, self-assured, and often speaks in similes that involve things like spaniels, grandmothers, rhododendrons and oysters – evokes sensations of an earlier, stronger Britain. Sentences come heavy with italics and euphemism, sometimes both. (I once heard Soames characterise the royal family as “that side of things”). His default mood is one of loud amusement. At Oxford, where Soames was president of the union, he spent most of his time spinning records. He drove down to London twice a week to play the decks at Annabel’s, and brought the beats to Charles and Diana’s engagement party in 1981. He might have been the poshest DJ in the world. He loves control, and he loves to lead. When Lyons met Soames, he perceived “a streak running through him of service and duty”, and he is not the only one. “It is something almost military,” an old friend, who has known Soames since university, told me. “It cascades down from his grandfather. He likes to look over his shoulder and see 10,000 people marching.”

Soames himself hates this kind of talk. He abhors swanking of any kind, and bristles at casual references to his background. “Somebody asked me: ‘What’s it like being Churchill’s grandson?’” he said to me once, putting on a nasal voice to indicate that this was an annoying question. “And I say, I have got no fucking idea because I have never been anything else.”

Still, he possesses an innate relish for the work of the state, what he calls “the public service bit”. Soames went for the Serco job on the day he heard that Hyman had resigned. And despite working in the private sector all his life, there is a sense that in the unglamorous world of public sector outsourcing – thankless, complex and human – Soames has joined the family tradition at last. “Rupert,” as his older brother Sir Nicholas, put it, “has the architecture.” Since taking over at Serco, he has begun to replace the company’s corporate speak of “value creation” and “market opportunities” with a more plain-spoken dialect of people and their problems. “This is called government. This is called public affairs,” Soames said once, when we were discussing Serco’s high-profile contracts to detain asylum seekers in the UK and Australia. He could have been speaking at prime minister’s questions.

For all the assurance that he has brought, however, and the shadow of his forefathers, no one knows whether Soames can save Serco. About a month after he got the job, he went to see Margaret Hodge, the chair of the House of Commons public accounts committee, parliament’s main watchdog over the UK’s £120bn outsourcing industry. “He said he was going to turn it all around,” she told me. “All the gossip to me was that he was going to go bust.”

The company has staggered from month to month. Since 2013, Serco has issued three profit warnings, raised £715m from its shareholders to meet its debts, and announced losses of more than £1bn. Its share price has traced a long and dismal totter, from 682p in July 2013 to 126p now – a decline of more than 80%. In the City, many analysts doubt that the company can ever recover. “If there is one person who can turn around a sinking ship it is probably Rupert,” one told me. “But he wouldn’t be the first good manager to meet a bad company.” For most of us, however, the questions are different. How did Serco get so big in the first place? Is it worth saving at all?

Hiring private companies and self-interested individuals to deliver public services is an old, if charged, arrangement. For centuries, kings and queens had no option but to contract out courts, taxes, roads, prisons, to nobles and business folk. The spectre of “old corruption” – a deadening lattice of sweetheart deals, public offices traded for personal profit – was a permanent fixture at British elections until the mid-19th century. The emergence of the welfare state and large government bureaucracies helped to banish this tension, and to incubate popular distrust of private actors operating in the public realm.

The rise of modern government outsourcing has its origins in business theory. In 1937, Ronald Coase, a young left-leaning lecturer at the London School of Economics, published a short paper called The Nature of the Firm, in which he considered why companies contracted out some of their functions, but did others in-house. “Why is not all production carried on by one big firm?” he asked. Coase developed the idea that organisations are constantly searching for a balance between the “transaction costs” involved in hiring external suppliers to do certain tasks and the increased potential for mistakes, waste, and the “decreasing returns to the entrepreneur function” if a company tries to do everything itself. After the war, Coase, who later won the Nobel prize for economics, moved to the University of Chicago. He gave up on socialism and his work became influential among a new generation of free-market theorists keen to question the preference of large organisations – particularly governments – to direct their own affairs rather than seeking the skills and competitive pricing of the open market.

They first made the case for outsourcing in bins. During the gloomy, stagnant days of big government in the 1970s, economists crisscrossed the US, Europe and Japan to find out what happened when cities hired private companies to collect their rubbish. It was a no-brainer. In the US, Steve Savas, a champion of privatisation who later joined the Reagan administration, found that New York’s sanitation department only worked half the time. A team in Japan recorded savings of 124% when towns outsourced their refuse services. Private companies were more productive and had better trucks. In the mid-1980s, the Institute for Fiscal Studies carried out a survey of 309 British councils and found average savings of 22%, and no reduction in quality, when they used private dustbin men. This evidence became an important basis for the 1988 Local Government Act, which introduced competitive tendering for around £2.5bn in local services in the UK, and launched the British outsourcing market. Nicholas Ridley, Margaret Thatcher’s environment secretary, dreamed of town councils that met once a year to sign a bunch of contracts, and then went home again.

Serco was ready and waiting – although it wasn’t called Serco yet. Until 1987, it was RCA Services Ltd, the British arm of a fading American conglomerate. The Radio Corporation of America had grown to subsume everything from hire car companies (Hertz) to publishing houses (Random House). Its electronic services division in the UK was a small, modestly profitable corner of the business. It made money maintaining two very large military facilities that it had built for the British government: the nation’s ballistic missile early warning system, at RAF Fylingdales on the North York moors; and a secret state-of-the-art radar at Orford Ness, the UK’s atomic weapons research base in Suffolk. When Thatcher extended her outsourcing campaign to central government departments, RCA’s deals with the Ministry of Defence became prototypes for civil servants across Whitehall.

The managers at RCA paused to reconsider their own work as well. They thought of themselves as scientists and engineers – Richard White, one of Serco’s founders, who joined RCA in 1970, had trained as a chemist – but more than half of the company’s 700 employees at RAF Fylingdales had more routine jobs. They looked after the grounds, the post, the canteen. The art, it turned out, was in running the people, not the radar. “We reinvented ourselves as a management organisation,” White told me. In 1984, RCA won the MoD’s first official outsourcing contract, to operate a big supply depot at RAF Quedgeley, in Gloucestershire. “We had never run a store in our lives,” said White. But that didn’t matter. The RAF’s storekeepers, who transferred into the new company, knew how to do that. Three years later, White helped to lead a management buyout, and RCA Services Ltd became Serco.

The early years of Serco were characterised by a sense of limitlessness. There was no end to what governments could, in theory, contract out. “It just felt like the whole world was opening up,” White told me, “and we seemed to have the right formula to meet it.” The company assumed the shape it more or less holds today – a small head office overseeing hundreds of Serco outposts, teams of 30 or 50 or 100, out running some corner of what used to be a state concern: the display boards on the M25, a prison in New Zealand, a road tunnel in Hong Kong. From the start, contract managers were encouraged to think of themselves as their own bosses, with their own businesses to run.

Back at headquarters, a team of 20 or so, led by a group of founding directors known as the “gang of four”, bid for new work, and reimagined the future of public services. The company set up a thinktank, the Serco Institute, which studied the outsourcing of the past – 18th-century contracts to transport convicts to Australia – and public services overseas. The gang came to see the border between the public and private sector as a cultural artefact: strongly held, but always shifting. “Just a movable line,” according to White. In Denmark, for instance, emergency services have been privately delivered since the 1920s, but care for the elderly remains overwhelmingly a state concern. In Sweden, the opposite is true: large-scale outsourcing of care services began in the 1990s, but nobody would dare touch the state’s fire engines or ambulances.

Serco’s confidence, research and omnivorousness distinguished it from its rivals. Rentokil did cleaning; G4S did security; Capita did IT; Serco did anything and everything – and its panache in the bidding process meant that it often beat out competition from specialist firms. For a long time the company had a formidable “win rate”, securing 70% of the contracts it bid for.

In 1989, Serco had 3,000 employees and revenues of £59m. Ten years later, it had 27,000 employees and revenues of more than £800m. By that time, New Labour had loosed the second great wave of outsourcing across Britain’s public services – although now under a rubric of improving choice and value for money for citizens, rather than the overt Thatcherite goal of dismantling the state.

Again, Serco was on hand to pick up the work. The company got involved in privately financed hospitals, prisons and military facilities; took over failing local education authorities in Bradford and Walsall; and won its first major immigration contract, to run the Yarl’s Wood immigration removal centre, in 2006. Serco sent managers abroad, to win transport, science and prison work in Australia and the US. For a while, the company had 47 staff in Antarctica. It administered Canadian driving tests. It became responsible for setting Greenwich Mean Time. The graphs in its annual reports – revenues, profits, dividends – resembled endless staircases, disappearing upwards.

Serco became an international business that claimed to have squared the circle of public service and private gain. In 2005, its revenues leapt by almost 40% to £2.2bn. Hyman was the perfect frontman. He made success sound inevitable. “We can quadruple and it won’t affect the model at all,” he told Management Today in 2007. “We could become a multinational with hundreds of thousands of workers and it still wouldn’t matter.”

For this article, I spoke to nurses, porters, cleaners, swimming teachers, train managers and prison guards who worked for Serco, and at its best, they described a company that made steady profits delivering public services with more care than the state ever did. “I made more of a difference than in any other period of my life,” said Lee Barnes, a former prison governor who joined Serco and saw the company give prisoners keys to their cells and guards being addressed by their first names. “They encouraged us. They allowed us to do that.” Another former employee, who had been a trade union official, was proud that Serco has never faced a strike on its contracts. “They had this mindset that public sectors were good people surrounded by bad systems,” he said. “It was a brilliant paradigm.” In March 2013, two months before the tagging scandal broke, Serco reported revenues of £4.9bn and profits of £302m, the highest in the company’s 25-year history.

When Soames started work at Serco, he had a clear idea of what he expected to find. “Big reputational damage,” he told me, “but fundamentally the business would be very sound.”

Within a week or two, however, he sensed that Serco was in a much more fragile state than it appeared. The company’s sales forecasts for the year were unravelling, and its profits were declining at an alarming rate – in a way that far exceeded the expected impact from the tagging scandal and negative headlines of 2013. On 1 May, officially his first day in the job, Soames issued a profits warning and launched an emergency fundraising of £160m to keep the company ahead of its debts. “It became obvious,” he told me, “that the world was falling out of its bottom.”

Soames spent the first 16 years of his career at GEC – the General Electric Company plc – the British electronics giant, and came to revere its legendary and prickly chief executive, Arnold Weinstock. At its height, GEC consisted of 180 companies and had a workforce of 250,000. For three decades, Weinstock ruled this empire from a set of dimly lit offices in Knightsbridge decorated with pictures of racehorses. The key to the operation was a set of standardised monthly reports filed by every GEC business: eight ratios (profit margin, staff turnover and so on) on the first page; raw figures on the second page; a written commentary thereafter. Weinstock spent hours each day scouring these documents, covering them in red ink, picking up the telephone, firing people if necessary. At the end of the day, he made a point of switching the lights out himself.

Soames has replicated GEC’s reporting system wherever he has worked. (He has two photographs in his dressing room, one of Weinstock, the other of his father.) When he arrived at Serco, the first thing he asked for was a copy of the monthly accounts. They did not exist. (Because Serco’s contracts are long-term – most of them last between three and seven years – the company had only ever collected its financial data every quarter.) Next, Soames asked to see a database of the company’s order book of 700 contracts, showing which ones were in profit, and which were loss-making. That did not exist either. As the incoming chief executive, part of Soames’s job was to reassure a demoralised workforce, but he was taken aback by how little Serco knew about its own business. “When you see things that may be deeply shocking,” he told me, “you can’t show your shock.”

In the meantime, the bad news kept arriving. Experienced staff were jumping ship. Serco’s damaged reputation meant it was losing outsourcing bids that it would normally win, and there was a troubling drip-drip of allegations from some of the company’s most sensitive contracts. These included Yarl’s Wood, where Serco detains female asylum seekers on behalf of the government. Its staff have been accused of sexual abuse and 10 guards were fired last year. “I was counting my days on the basis of how many really, really shitty bits of news happened a day, and it used to be four,” said Soames. “If I hadn’t had my four bits of bad news, I knew something was wrong. I knew there was something I didn’t know.”

The air slowly cleared. It took two months to build the contract database. (Soames is a nut for spreadsheets and databases: he likes to re-enter the digits himself.) He discovered that Serco operated in 38 different markets, from dog wardens in Birmingham to air traffic control in Baghdad. He hired his former finance director from Aggreko, Angus Cockburn, and brought in 40 accountants from Ernst & Young to perform a triage on Serco’s global order book, looking for hidden risks and possible losses. Soames adopted a voice from Monty Python when he described this process. “Bring out yer dead,” he hollered. “Suddenly, these bodies started flying out.”

Soames discovered that Serco operated in 38 markets, from dog wardens in Birmingham to air traffic control in Baghdad

Soames came to see that Serco’s finances were under attack from three different directions. First, there was the continuing fallout from the tagging dispute of the previous year. (In the end, Serco paid back £68.5m for the tagging debacle, and agreed to forgo any future profits on its prisoner escort contract. The Serious Fraud Office investigation into the tagging contract continues.) More broadly, however, the company had not negotiated the economic crisis anywhere like as well as it had claimed. The arrival of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition unleashed Britain’s third great wave of outsourcing since the 1980s – between 2010 and 2015, the industry doubled in size from £64bn a year to £120bn as new health, probation and benefit services hit the market – but many of Serco’s new contracts were hastily designed and bid for, and barely breaking even.

The main reason, according to several former directors I spoke to, was a subtle but noticeable shift in the company’s priorities that began in the mid-2000s. Under Hyman, Serco became steadily engrossed by its own financial performance. He set the company an internal goal of joining the FTSE 100 list of the UK’s largest companies, which it achieved in December 2008. During the depths of the global economic downturn, in 2010, the company then set itself a new goal – to become “the world’s greatest service company” – and issued ambitious forecasts for revenue growth and profits by 2012. Chasing these targets in the face of austerity in the UK and the federal shutdown in the US meant expanding into new areas, such as clinical healthcare and large-scale private outsourcing, which Serco had avoided in the past.

A former director, who had left Serco and rejoined the company around this time, found many of his colleagues increasingly pressurised and alienated by a culture almost entirely focused on the bottom line. The Serco Institute was shut down. So-called “black hat conferences”, at which hardened public service managers used to be invited to challenge the optimistic bidding assumptions made by the financial teams at headquarters either did not take place, or were formalities, dominated by bid teams. “It was all these commercial guys, just modelling it without any notion of what would happen,” the director told me. By 2014, Serco was managing to lose money on an outsourcing deal with Hertfordshire county council – the kind of work it had done for a generation.

More worrying, even, than either of these, Soames discovered that scattered throughout its books, Serco also had a small number of contracts that put it on the hook for potentially unlimited losses. If you spend time with people in the outsourcing industry these days, the subject most of them want to talk about is “risk transfer”. As well as creating money-making opportunities, novel forms of outsourcing contracts in the last decade have also, on occasion, left private companies exposed to extraordinary levels of financial damage and public loathing. Even small miscalculations, or unexpected events, can carry vast consequences. Serco’s rush to growth made it more vulnerable to these risky deals than most, and from the moment he arrived at the company, Soames began to hear more and more about the 14 Armidale patrol boats that it had agreed to supply to the Australian Navy in 2004.

The contract was simple enough. Serco had to make the patrol boats available for a total of 3,600 operating days a year. If they broke down, it was Serco’s problem. In the early years, the Armidales made money for Serco, but from 2008 onwards, Australia faced a sudden increase in asylum seekers attempting to reach the country by sea. Between 2007 and 2012, the numbers leapt from 148 to more than 17,000, and the Armidales were the navy’s chosen means to intercept the migrants’ fragile boats as they approached the coast. The patrol boats were driven harder and faster than ever before. They developed corrosion and cracking in their hulls. Amazingly, for several years, Serco was able to offset any losses from the patrol boats because it also had the contracts to detain the asylum seekers in immigration camps once they landed in Australia. For this work, it was paid on a volume basis – per asylum seeker. The surge in refugees made these contracts the most profitable in Serco’s entire global portfolio, bringing in £450m in 2013.

But from the July of that year, a dramatic change in Australia’s immigration policy – under which all “illegal maritime arrivals” would now be detained in Papua New Guinea – meant that Serco faced a double blow: fewer asylum seekers came, and the Armidales still required expensive maintenance. To add a further, mind-altering twist: it was possible that some of those immigrants would now head for Britain, where Serco also had contracts to provide temporary accommodation to asylum seekers – but because it had negotiated those deals poorly, it was now losing money on every person that it housed in the UK. “It is called falling off the swing,” said Soames, when he tried to explain all this to me, “and getting hit on the back of the head by the roundabout.”

There are times, when considering Serco, that it begins to resemble Milo Minderbinder’s syndicate, M&M Enterprises, in the novel Catch-22, which starts out trading melons and sardines between opposing armies in the second world war, and ends up conducting bombing raids for commercial reasons. If you are going to make money in conflict, or the messy affairs of human life, Milo reasons, you might as well play as many sides of the action as possible. “In a democracy, the government is the people,” he argues. “We’re people aren’t we? So we might as well keep the money and eliminate the middle man.”

Last autumn, Soames and Cockburn concluded that a handful of contracts – led by the Armidales, and the deal to house asylum seekers in the UK – could cost Serco up to £500m in losses, which posed a mortal threat to the business. They began a series of weekly meetings with officials at the Cabinet Office to brief them on the company’s financial state. According to Soames, these conversations prompted the government to develop a contingency plan in case Serco went bankrupt.

On 10 November, Soames announced a new strategy for the company: it would be simpler, and smaller, and serve governments only. The moves into healthcare and business outsourcing were to be abandoned and sold off. (In 2015, Serco expects to have revenues of £3.5bn, around two-thirds of what it was making at its peak.) The company would sell its recent acquisitions, shedding tens of thousands of employees. Soames also revealed the scale of Serco’s losses for the first time: a total of £1.3bn – the equivalent of its last 20 years of profits combined.

* * *

Soames and I spent several afternoons together in May and June, talking about what had gone wrong at Serco. Often we met in his seventh-floor office near Victoria. He always wore the same uniform: dark suit, braces, specially tailored blue herringbone shirts with the words “Serco – and proud of it” sewn into the right side of his chest. Since the tagging scandal and the misreporting of statistics on its Cornwall healthcare contract in 2012, Serco has also been stripped of its responsibility to sterilise medical equipment at Fiona Stanley Hospital in Perth, western Australia, and has been criticised by human rights groups for its treatment of asylum seekers in both Australia and the UK. (In March, the company launched an independent review, led by a former barrister, Kate Lampard, of conditions at Yarl’s Wood.)

One subject we kept returning to was whether the company’s fixation with growth – its compulsion, publicly and internally, to meet the revenue “commitments” set by its top management – had contributed to its ethical and performance failures. Soames’s essential argument was that the two were unrelated. “I think you can construct a story linking the pressure for financial performance to those ethical breaches. I personally think that is wrong,” he said.

But Soames’s language wavered. Sometimes when we talked, Serco’s profit targets and the level of care it put into its public services existed in “parallel universes”. Other times there was “a tenuous connection”. Once Soames acknowledged that “one made the other worse”. When I told him about a Serco manager I had spoken to in Cornwall, who described staff in tears every day in early 2012 as they contended with unrealistic financial demands from head office and a healthcare contract they were struggling desperately to meet, he said: “I don’t know. I wasn’t there.” He did not pretend that the question was straightforward. “I don’t go to bed at night thinking, ‘Oh well, sorted that one then,’” he said.

The restless dynamic between corporate profit and public service lies at the heart of why many of us feel anxious about outsourcing. The dice seem loaded from the start. People at Serco used to puzzle over this mistrust. “I think the public is divided,” one of the company’s former board members told me. We hate waste, he explained. We tend to approve of competitive tendering. We acknowledge the existence of good, vocationally driven private actors in the public realm, like GPs. “On the other hand,” the board member went on, “people are deeply suspicious of the profit motive. They know how powerful the profit motive is and they worry if you get the incentives wrong that will produce horrible consequences.”

Outsourcers also threaten us because their growth entails the dismantling of something that was familiar. Public sector monopolies may not have always been effective, but at least they came with a story, an implied commitment to a common cause. They were, in some inescapable sense, ours. By contrast, the rise of the UK’s public services industry – which now employs more than a million people and is the world’s second largest, after America’s – is an experiment that has been conducted largely without a narrative, and whose principal agents are large companies that belong to their shareholders. They are, in some inescapable sense, not ours. (Serco’s largest investors, by way of example, are hedge funds, American value investors and the Singaporean government.)

Market forces, transaction costs and Coasian bargaining theory do not care if we believe in them or not. Politicians do not help much. They do not celebrate or explain outsourcing, even as the consensus solidifies about the “mixed economy” required to deliver Britain’s public services to an ageing population unwilling to pay higher taxes. All the main parties are signed up. They just don’t like to talk about it. Even Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP are Serco customers: they unveiled the company’s new contract to run the Caledonian Sleeper service in March. The experiment proceeds. The stakes get higher.

* * *

Since March, and the conclusion of Serco’s latest fundraising from its shareholders, Soames has been able to get out and about more. He tries to visit one of the company’s contracts every week. On a recent Friday morning, he picked me up from a station near where he lives with his family in Buckinghamshire (Soames keeps a small mixed farm: “Twelve Sussex cows, plus a bull”) and drove us to RAF Benson, in Oxfordshire, where Serco trains helicopter pilots for the armed forces in computer simulators. On the way, we talked about his childhood. Soames spent many days at Chartwell, the Churchill family home, as a young boy, and remembers being dandled on the great man’s knee. The legacy, more than anything, is of industry: all those books, all those paintings, all those wars. “It was an immense thing,” he said, “this prodigious work ethic …” These days, Soames works seven days a week, five or six hours on Saturdays and Sundays. His staff wake up to emails and memos – noodlings – time-stamped at 6am, or 10pm.

At the helicopter base, Soames busied himself in the arcana of outsourcing. At RAF Benson, where Serco earns around £4m a year on a contract it has held since 1997, the company is trying to supply the same amount of flight training to the MoD with fewer pilots. Soames spent the morning talking to the contract manager about shift patterns and the cost of helicopter earphones. He tried out the flight simulator, rejected his instructor’s suggestion that he use the autopilot, and crashed in a field. “And it was all going so swimmingly,” he said. After the screen froze, Soames asked to be taken upstairs to see the servers. He stood with his hands on his hips, facing a bank of humming machines, as if he might find the glitch with his own eyes.

At lunchtime, the Serco staff gathered in a meeting room and ate from a cold buffet. Everywhere Soames goes in the company, he gives a stump speech about what went wrong, and how he is trying to fix it, which lasts about seven minutes. Then he asks for questions. Consciously or not, Soames often slips in military references when he speaks. At an in-house awards ceremony in May, he compared the company’s shareholders to Von Blücher’s cavalry at Waterloo. He always closes with the same words: “Someone once said, and I can’t think who: ‘This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.’”

At RAF Benson, the pilots chuckled, but the conversation quickly turned serious. They wanted to know what Soames was doing to stop the bean-counters from taking over the company again. They wanted to know if the political tide might turn against outsourcing one day. “People don’t want to pay more tax,” said Soames. “It ain’t going to happen.” Towards the end, one pilot with a direct manner told Soames they had been treated like “toilet cleaners” by the previous management and asked about the estimated £4m pay-off that Hyman received when he left. For a moment, the room went quiet. “I have no problem with you asking the question just as you are going to have no problem with me not answering it,” said Soames. He spoke carefully. “I wasn’t involved. I wasn’t there, and you know what, I couldn’t give a damn. I intend to be different. And that is not to say the past was right or wrong, but I am not the same.”

Later, driving back to the station, I wondered whether we will look back on this moment, in the early 21st century – like we look back on the 1970s, or the 18th century – and be astonished by a single company doing so many things, in so many places, for and to so many citizens. Soames was on his way home to work for a few more hours. When you run a state within a state, there is always something demanding your attention. “It sounds pompous,” he said to me once, “but I feel that everything I have done previously was building up to do this.”

That afternoon, unusually, Soames’s voice carried an edge of tiredness. We pulled up at the station to wait for my train. I asked him if he thought he would ever miss this – the ongoing sense of crisis, a sceptical public, the darkness before the dawn – and he covered his face with his hands. “Fuck no,” he said. Soames slumped in his seat and he started to laugh. “Oh, God,” he guffawed. “Oh, God.” But wouldn’t he be bored, I said, if all was well in the world of Serco? “I don’t see that happening. I don’t see that for a long time,” said Soames. “I will get chucked out before that.”

Unite members employed by the private contractor Serco, working at Barts Health NHS Trust, have overwhelmingly voted to strike for a proper pay rise.



99 per cent of workers that took part in the ballot voted yes to strike action. Workers are now planning a three day strike starting on Tuesday 4 July, followed by a seven day stoppage starting on Tuesday 11 July and then a 14 day strike starting on 25 July. Further strike action will also be planned for August and September.



Gloria Sindall, Unite regional officer said: “Low paid cleaners, porters and security staff have voted for strike action by a massive majority because they have seen their real living standards drop year on year. Workers are now demanding a 30p per hour wage increase. Serco made over £80 million in profit last year but managers are refusing to share these earnings fairly and protect the living standards of the workers.



“Unite members are fed up and are preparing for a series of strikes to demand a fair and proper pay rise which recognises the contribution they make to Serco and to Barts.”



Serco won the £600 million soft services contract for Barts Health NHS Trust last year. The company made a profit of £82 million, and pays its chief executive over £1 million a year. Unite members employed by Serco as domestic staff, porters and security workers at Barts Health NHS Trust want a 30p per hour wage increase but the claim has been rejected by Serco.



Workers also called for a strike ballot because porters at Whipps Cross Hospital are up in arms over Serco’s plans to cut jobs, and to make matters worse Serco has also increased workloads to unsustainable levels for cleaners across the Trust.

Luxury flats with a price tag of up to £50m were touted as an easy sell – yet have failed to shift as the London market slows

When it opened the developers of the Shard boasted that it should only take “about 20 phone calls” to sell the 10 exclusive apartments near the top of the tower for up to £50m each.

Yet five years on from the Duke of York and the former prime minister of Qatar officially opening “Europe’s first vertical city” with a dazzling laser display on 5 July 2012, all 10 of the flats on the 53rd to 65th floors of the 72-storey building appear to remain unsold.

Brochures for the apartments, which include three two-storey duplex units, boasted that on a clear day residents should be able to see the sea and the grandstands at Ascot from their new perch in the centre of the capital.

The penthouse stands at 735ft, just below the entrance to the £30.95-a-time public viewing deck, which attracts up to 6,000 visitors a day. Even the lowest apartment, which it was hoped would sell for £30m, is higher than any home ever built in London.

But the brochures are no longer available and the tower’s developers and its Qatari owners are reluctant to speak about the residences, which they had boasted would be among the most luxurious in London. As well as the views and double-height entertaining space, potential residents were said to have the luxury of being able to order room service from the five-star Shangri-La hotel below, and call on its maids to turn down their beds. A “back stairs” service lift was shown in floorplans so meals and cleaners could be delivered directly to the apartments’ kitchens.

Baron Phillips, spokesman for Irvine Sellar, the recently deceased property visionary who led the development of the Shard, declined to comment about the unsold apartments. It was Phillips who told the media that several of the world’s super-rich had expressed interest in buying apartments years before the building was finished and said of selling them: “I should think about 20 phone calls should do it, don’t you?”

Sellar convinced Italian architect Renzo Piano to design the Shard over lunch in Berlin in 2000, with the first designs sketched on a menu. But the project nearly collapsed in the wake of the 2007-08 financial crisis before Qatar stepped in to buy 80% of the tower.

Representatives of Qatar Diar, the real estate arm of the gulf state’s sovereign wealth fund, did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Real Estate Management, the property management firm appointed to oversee the day-to-day management of the Shard, said the apartments were still “completely empty shells”.

No apartment sales have been recorded by the Land Registry. Levels 53 to 65 and the apartments’ exclusive entrance on the ground floor were in December 2015 leased to LBQ Four, a Jersey-registered firm believed to be part of the London Bridge Quarter, the holding company that owns the Shard. The 250-year lease valued the 10 apartments at a total of £199,250,000.

Henry Pryor, a luxury property buying agent, said he was not surprised that the Shard’s owners had yet to sell any of the apartments as a sale of one apartment would set a publicly recorded price and make it harder to sell the other apartments for more if and when the London ultra-prime property market improves.

“If they could sell them for what they want for them they would have sold by now,” he said. “If they sell they will crystallise a price and that makes it very difficult for future sales because the benchmark has been set. That is one reason developers chuck in goodies [like cars or fine wine] to keep the apparent price up.”

Pryor said the Shard apartments have not been able to attract prices near the record £136m paid for a flat in the Candy brothers’ One Hyde Park for reasons that any avid watcher of TV property shows would know: “Location, location, location.”

“Kirstie and Phil tell us it every week, location, location, location. Rich people don’t want to shell out zillions living south of the river, it’s a shock enough living anywhere south of the [Hyde] park,” he said. “Nobody knows anyone who lives south of the river.”

The Shard has done better at letting the lower floors for offices, although many have gone to companies owned or partially owned by Qatar. But some whole floors are still to be let, including all 29,824 sq ft of the 12th floor.

The University of Warwick’s business school has rented level 17 and fitted it out with a lecture theatre with perhaps the best student view in the world.

The former office building will be turned into 82 one- to five-bedroom apartments averaging £3.2m each

Work has begun to convert London’s landmark Centre Point building into luxury flats.

The former office building has been a focal point on the skyline for five decades, and at various times a symbol of the property industry’s failings and of protest against the capital’s lack of affordable housing. Now it will be turned into 82 one- to five- bedroom apartments boasting pool, spa and fitness facilities, as well as views over the west end.

Nearby, three-bedroom flats are being marketed at an average of £3.2m. A block of 13 affordable homes will be built next door as part of the project.

Centre Point, which stands at the cross-section of Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Street, attracted controversy when it was first built by property tycoon Harry Hyams in 1966. It stood empty as he tried unsuccessfully to find a single tenant willing to pay the money take it on, and squatters moved in briefly to demonstrate against its residential areas remaining empty when London was in the grip of a housing crisis. Eventually let, it changed hands several times before being bought by current owners Almacantar 2011.

The developers have taken on Rick Mather Architects and Conran and Partners to design the project, who, it said would “revive its sixties design appeal alongside cutting edge design and technology”. The project, which will include a new public square and 41,780 square feet of retail space, is next to Tottenham Court Road station which will eventually be served by the new Crossrail links.

Kathrin Hersel, development director, Almacantar, said the work would “turn Centre Point into a destination Londoners can be proud of”. She added: “The project will breathe new life into this landmark, giving it a sustainable and exciting future for the benefit of all Londoners and visitors to the capital.”

Work on Centre Point is expected to finish in the summer of 2017.

The development may be attractive to overseas buyers who are keen to invest in London property. Recent figures from the Department of Business showed in some parts of London a fifth of properties were owned by foreign buyers and in one development in Thameside it emerged 80% of homes had been snapped up by purchasers from overseas.

Androids could offer valuable help to the elderly and disabled but may lead to the increased objectification of women

Sex robots have the potential to provide a valuable service for people who are elderly, disabled or who find intercourse traumatic, but they also carry ethical risks, experts say.

Sex robots that look like humans can already be bought or leased for parties in the US, and plans for a cafe staffed by “erotic cyborgs” in Paddington, London, have been mooted.

The authors behind the Foundation for Responsible Robotics’ (FRR) report, published on Wednesday, believe they could herald a “revolution” in sex, helping people who would otherwise find it hard to have intimate relationships.

Sex robots: innovation driven by male masturbatory fantasy is no revolution | Suzanne Moore Read more

But they also raise concerns that sex robots could increase the objectification of women, alter perceptions of consent and be used to satisfy desires that would otherwise be illegal.

Dr Aimee van Wynsberghe, assistant professor in ethics and technology at the Technical University of Delft and FRR co-director, said: “If we are talking about individuals who are not only disabled but have been traumatised, in some ways this could be a beneficial instrument, if you will, to help them in their [sexual] healing process.

“There are absolutely some benefits to the technology but, like everything else, there is a balance. You have to strike a balance between lack of regulation – so we have all different uses and personifications of children and women as sexual objects – or you have overregulation and you stifle the technology. You have to find the way to balance so you really can harness the good.”

Among the people it is proposed could benefit from interaction with sex robots are elderly people in care homes, people of both sexes who have had a traumatic sexual experience and men who suffer from erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation.

Report co-author Noel Sharkey, professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at Sheffield University, said their popularity will ultimately be determined by how realistic they are and their social acceptability. While robots look similar to humans, their movements and speech are still crude, said Sharkey, making them a far cry from the robotic bordello hosts in the HBO series Westworld.

“It might be a little niche thing or it might be something that stag nights go to,” said Sharkey. He also raised the prospect of it being a “safe way” for couples to experience a ménage à trois.

Four manufacturers are currently making sex robots, ranging in price from $5,000 (£3,870) to $15,000, but the intention is to eventually make them more affordable.

Among those available is the RoxxxyGold, about which there has been some disquiet because of a selectable mode – Frigid Farah – in which its personality is described as “reserved and shy”. A paper published earlier this year said the manufacturer claimed that if “you touched her in a private area, more than likely, she will not be to[o] appreciative of your advance”, leading some to claim that it is indulging rape fantasies.

Treating paedophiles with robot sex-children is both a dubious and repulsive idea

Sharkey said: “Some people say: ‘Well, it’s better they rape robots than rape real people.’ That’s one of the arguments … you can have enjoyable [sex] with your wife - all nice - but when it comes to rape, you have a rape fantasy, you go off and rape a robot. But there’s other people saying this will just encourage rapists more.”

There are also fears that child sex robots could be created. There are already child sex dolls made by a Japanese company owned by a self-confessed paedophile, who claims they prevent him and other paedophiles abusing real children. However, Sharkey is sceptical of the argument that robots can help people get over rape or child sex fantasies, suggesting it is more likely to “encourage paedophilia and make it acceptable to assault children”.

The report quotes Patrick Lin, director of the ethics and emerging sciences group, at California Polytechnic State University, who says: “Treating paedophiles with robot sex-children is both a dubious and repulsive idea. Imagine treating racism by letting a bigot abuse a brown robot. Would that work? Probably not.”

Both male and female robots are available, but there are particular concerns they could amplify objectification of women, with complaints that female versions are based on representations garnered from pornography. They could affect human interactions in other ways, suggests van Wynsberghe.

“Sex robots are an interesting case study, if you will, to look at the main issues we face with robotics, writ large,” she said. “So this idea of moral de-skilling ... we’re interacting with the robots in these companionship, personalised ways and what kind of consequences does that have on the human users? Does that mean we won’t want to interact with humans any more because it’s just easier to talk to the robot or easier to engage in sexual gratification with the robot?”

In the latest in a series on the UK’s increasingly precarious world of work, we reveal how many institutions are charging higher student fees while more than half of lecturers are on non-permanent or hourly-paid contracts

One of the most highly skilled and prestigious professions in Britain, university teaching, is now dominated by zero-hours contracts, temp agencies and other forms of precarious work, the Guardian can reveal.



New analysis reveals that it is the richest Russell Group institutions that rely most heavily on insecure academic workers. The Guardian investigation has led trade unionists to accuse vice-chancellors of “importing the Sports Direct model” into British universities. It has also prompted the National Union of Students to warn that low-paid and overstressed tutors may not be providing quality education to undergraduates paying tuition fees of up to £9,000 a year.

Revealed: temp agencies' avoidance scheme costs taxpayers 'hundreds of millions' Read more

Academics teaching or doing research in British universities will typically have spent years earning doctorates or other qualifications, yet more than half of them – 53% – manage on some form of insecure, non-permanent contract. They range from short-term contracts that typically elapse within nine months, to those paid by the hour to give classes or mark essays and exams.

Among junior academics – those most likely to be doing frontline teaching – three-quarters are on these kinds of precarious contracts. It is highly likely that the majority of undergraduates are paying many thousands of pounds to be taught by casual workers.

The investigation is part of a series of articles published in the Guardian this week about the growing numbers of people in Britain who find themselves in precarious work. The figures come from the Higher Education Statistics Agency and have been analysed by the University and College Union (UCU). They show that within the Russell Group, the Universities of Birmingham and Warwick have the largest proportion of frontline teaching staff on short-term or zero-hours and other flexible contracts. At Birmingham, 70% of teaching staff are on insecure contracts, while at Warwick it is 68%. Yet Birmingham has begun a vast £500m building project, including a new sports centre costing £55m and student housing.

The analysis suggests that as the university sector charges higher student fees and faces further competition, many institutions are getting into speculative building and expansion of their business models, even while many of their frontline teaching staff are struggling to get by. It also raises the prospect of a two-tier academic workforce, with those at the bottom living hand to mouth and unable to pursue research, while those at the top are very well paid. The vice-chancellor of the University of Birmingham, Sir David Eastwood, last year received a pay and performance package of £416,000 – nearly three times the prime minister’s salary.

Part-time lecturers on precarious work: 'I don't make enough for rent' Read more

One-year and two-year contracts are an inevitable part of grant-funded research. But these figures show temporary and zero-hours contracts are now widespread among those teaching undergraduates. University managers typically argue that such flexible contracts allow young academics to gain valuable experience. But in interviews with the Guardian, academics have disputed that argument from their own experience, including:

• A 44-year-old politics lecturer working at three different institutions at once but still earning only just over £6,000 a year, relying on benefits to top up his poverty pay.

• A 32-year-old linguistics lecturer who has experienced “serious mental health issues” and says “unstable work without a network of colleagues and without any security is proving really difficult”.

• A 49-year-old English lecturer who says: “I earn such a pathetic amount. I feel quite humiliated.”

Academics rarely speak out publicly against their precarious working arrangements for fear of being punished by losing hours. Some have spoken to the Guardian using a pseudonym while others have said they have “nothing left to lose”.

Academics on insecure contracts form “a reserve army of precarious and exploited labour”, claimed Sally Hunt, general secretary of the UCU. “Many universities are hacking up teaching jobs into ever smaller bits and shoving people on to the worst contract they can get away with. This is the Sports Direct model imported into our universities.”

The Guardian has seen sections of a private survey of academics on casual contracts at the University of Nottingham, one of the largest and most renowned institutions in the country. The comments include:

• “The lack of value that I feel towards me is passed on in my feelings towards the students’ education.”

• “I have heard people complaining about the fact that they are paid 10 minutes to correct one exam, therefore they will use only 10 minutes to read them.”

• “I am definitely much less inclined to go the extra mile in terms of preparing for a class.”

Teaching at a university means constant pressure - for about £5 an hour Read more

The NUS warned of the impact this could have on student learning. “When academic staff are demoralised and forced to cope with low pay and insecurity, the knock-on effect on students is significant,“ said Sorana Vieru, a vice-president at the union. “Many students are now taking on unprecedented levels of debt to go to university. They deserve good quality teaching and anything that damages that is deeply unjust.”

Universities are independent charities, but the Department for Business has told the Guardian that conditions for academics will form part of the independent review of workers’ rights to be conducted for the government by Tony Blair’s former head of policy, Matthew Taylor.



University lecturers on the breadline: is the UK following in America’s footsteps? Read more

At a few universities such as Edinburgh, the use of zero-hours contracts has caused huge controversy and even led to managers pledging to scrap them. Yet the figures show that Edinburgh has shifted many of its teaching staff on to other kinds of insecure contract.

But the lobby group for academic employers, the Universities and Colleges Employers Association, argued: “It is essential that universities retain the ability to operate with part of their workforce in a flexible mode to enable them to respond to changes in demand. The variability in student enrolments on programmes, and features of academic life such as sabbaticals and research leave for permanent staff, mean that fixed-term opportunities to teach, generally for a year or a semester, are made available.”

The University of Birmingham said the figures, from the Higher Education Statistics Agency, were “extremely misleading”. It added in a statement: “While the university recognises that a significant number of individuals engaged in teaching are not on standard contracts, they provide only a small fraction of teaching (about 7%), because most of them are engaged for a small fraction of a full-time equivalent post.



“Many of the people in this category are expert visiting lecturers, from commerce, industry and the professions, who provide practical support and insight to our students based on their own experience; and others are our own research students, who communicate their enthusiasm for scientific endeavour to undergraduate students through their work as laboratory demonstrators or tutorial assistants, under the supervision of academic staff. We believe these individuals enhance the learning experiences of our students.”

Some survivors found their feelings too raw, and others were angered by news from coroner that recovery could take months

Victims’ families and survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire have spent more than two hours in an emotional and highly charged session with the police commander in charge of the ongoing police operation, and with the coroner tasked with identifying the dead, in the first official meeting with investigators.

Survivors and relatives were finding the meeting very upsetting, according to Lotifa Begum speaking on behalf of the Grenfell Muslim Response Unit, a combined effort of charities, volunteers and partner organisations supporting victims of the fire.

Several survivors left the meeting with Metropolitan police commander Stuart Cundy and Westminster coroner Fiona Wilcox because they were finding it so difficult, she said.



Relatives of the dead were angry and distressed to be told by the coroner that the recovery process could take months, according to Begum – who spent some time with the families outside the meeting hall.

More than 50 relatives and members of survivors’ families were in the private session, which was closed to the media, she said.

“Some of the families were angry about how long it is taking for details to come out,” she said, adding that the coroner had explained in detail to families how challenging it was going to be for investigators to identify the victims.



Early in the meeting, details were given of compensation payments available to relatives and survivors.

The Grenfell Response unit, the official London-wide council response team, tweeted from inside the session that those seriously injured in the fire would receive payments of £10,000.

The next of kin for each of those who lost their lives in the fire will receive an initial £20,000. Those made homeless will receive a “fresh start” grant of £10,000 when they are permanently rehoused. Families were instructed to apply for funds via their family liaison officer

The meeting came amid ongoing anger at the slow release of information from the police. Nabil Choucair, who still has no clear answers about the fate of six family members who lived on the 22nd floor, said earlier that he was upset by the way that officials were trying to control the flow of news to families.



“People just really, really want to know what happened to their loved ones,” he said.



Grenfell fire inquiry could be widened to reflect residents’ concerns Read more

Survivors had been asked to submit questions in writing earlier in the week, and they were worried that there would be no opportunity to ask questions in person, but the Met said later that questions were going to be taken from the hall.



Relatives were concerned about the overall death toll and the time it was taking to identify the dead. “The answers are not being given. People are asking the questions, but we are being told, ‘We still don’t know,’” Choucair said earlier.

He is still uncertain about what happened to his mother, Sirria Choucair; his brother-in-law, Bassem Choukair; his sister Nadia Choucair; and their three children: Mierna, 13; Fatima, 11; and Zainab, three.



His family has been allocated a family liaison officer by the police, but still had no confirmation about the fate of the missing relatives. Police have not formally told them that the family are missing, presumed dead.

“We are praying for the best,” he said. “It is killing us more than anything, not being told what we should know. It is very unfair and very inhumane. We have to sit by, every day and wonder what is happening. I can’t express how we all feel.”



Police have told the family that the top three floors, where his relatives lived in two flats, remain very unsafe.

“It is very unstable, very insecure,” he said. “They say it may take days, months, years to search. How can you tell a parent, loved ones, a family, ‘Just hang on in there, hold on, one day we will know’? That’s not right. It’s not fair. Things should be done more quickly.”



Each family was allowed to send up to five representatives to the meeting, which was held in a conference centre in Kensington. Choucair said he would be at the meeting with his brother, sister and uncle.



Sid-ali Atmani lived with his wife, daughter and stepson on the 15th floor of the tower. He said they were offered a two-bedroom flat in the nearby borough of Westminster, but he was holding out for something the right size and near his children’s school, adding that residents were “not asking for the moon, they are asking for dignity”.



Some of the flats being offered to Grenfell residents, he claimed, were not in a good condition.

“If I have to get a tent and live in the street, I will do it – until I get my dignity.”

Atmani, who had lived in the tower since 2015, declined to attend the meeting because of his treatment at the hands of the council and he said many other families who were living in the tower had done the same.

“They need to look at [residents’] needs and requests and look at their health problems,” Atmani said. “They need to approach each family individually … we need them to approach us more seriously and more sensitively.”

Solicitors at Bindmans, the law firm which is representing a number of families, said other questions that relatives had submitted and hoped would be answered at the meeting included: how long the criminal investigation would take; who has been identified as a potential suspect; what offences are being investigated; whether police were taking steps to seize minutes from the tenant management organisation meetings, and correspondence between the council and residents, and documentation in relation to building regulations, the inspection of the cladding and the general works at the tower.



There was also a widespread demand for detailed answers on the process of DNA testing and the recovery of bodies. Anna Thwaites, a Bindmans solicitor, said: “Families want information about why the identification process is taking so long.”

PM’s statement comes as resident says it will be ‘impossible task’ for Sir Martin Moore-Bick to overcome mistrust of community in wake of fire

Theresa May has claimed “no stone will be left unturned” by the public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower tragedy as she confirmed Sir Martin Moore-Bick, a retired judge, would lead the process.

The prime minister expects Moore-Bick will “want to produce an interim report as early as possible” to address the immediate lessons that need to be learned from the disaster.

The appointment, which emerged overnight on Wednesday, was met with doubts over his suitability for the role, given past rulings on controversial housing cases. Moore-Bick was expected to meet residents near the tower on Thursday morning.

“I am determined that there will be justice for all the victims of this terrible tragedy and for their families who have suffered so terribly,” May said.

In the written statement to MPs announcing the appointment, the prime minister said Moore-Bick was “highly respected and hugely experienced”. She added that the inquiry would investigate what happened at Grenfell, where at least 80 people died, and the wider issue of failed tests of flammable cladding around the country.



“Before the inquiry starts Sir Martin will consult all those with an interest, including survivors and victims’ families, about the terms of reference. Following that consultation he will make a recommendation to me,” she said.

“I will return to parliament with the final terms of reference once this process has taken place. Then the inquiry will begin its work.

“We must get to the truth about what happened. No stone will be left unturned by this inquiry, but I have also been clear that we cannot wait for ages to learn the immediate lessons and so I expect the chair will want to produce an interim report as early as possible.”

In a statement, Moore-Bick said the inquiry would “discover the truth about what happened at Grenfell Tower, so that we can learn lessons for the future and ensure that a tragedy of this kind never happens again”.



He went on: “It is vitally important that the inquiry be open, transparent and fair to all those whose involvement with Grenfell Tower comes under scrutiny. It is important for everyone that the inquiry should establish as quickly as possible the cause of the fire and how it was able to spread so quickly to the whole of the building.”

The judge said it was vital that families of victims and local residents were kept involved in the process. “I understand the desire of local people for justice; justice for them, and for all those involved in whatever way, will best be served by a vigorous inquiry that gets to the truth as quickly as possible,” he said.

“The inquiry will consider evidence from all parties involved, including victims and their families. The chair will work with complete independence from the government, supported by civil servants seconded from government departments.”

Moore-Bick was due to meet a representative group at a private meeting at 10am in the shadow of the charred tower before his appointment is officially confirmed by the government.



His appointment is already being questioned over his 2014 decision to allow Westminster council to rehouse a tenant 50 miles away from her home in Milton Keynes.

Pilgrim Tucker, a housing campaigner who worked with Grenfell Action Group to expose the safety flaws at the tower, said: “Residents pleaded with Theresa May to involve them in the decision-making about the inquiry. In appointing Sir Martin Moore-Bick, she has ignored them, and appointed a completely inappropriate judge. We can have no faith that this inquiry will produce justice for Grenfell residents.”

Oluwaseun Talabi, who escaped from his 14th-floor flat with his daughter tied to his back, said Moore-Bick would not give the victims justice.



Speaking to the BBC, he said: “We need a criminal judge. This is the same person that sent a woman all the way to Milton Keynes from Westminster. That’s not right. We need serious justice and this man is not going to give us any justice. We should have an influence. This is not right.”



One of the residents who was due to meet Moore-Bick said it was an “impossible task” for the former judge to overcome the mistrust of the community following the fire.



The resident, who did not want to be named, said: “He’s meeting with residents and then survivors. It is not necessarily a representative group, it is as representative as we could make it at six or seven hours’ notice. He’s coming to us. He will see the tower this morning. He clearly doesn’t want journalists and protesters hanging around; that would be unhelpful at this stage.”

Asked about the Westminster judgment, which some labelled “social cleansing,” the resident said: “Every judge has a judgment which can be held against them.

“I think he has got an impossible task with a proportion of the residents on the estate. You are dealing with a lot of people who have been disempowered and have absolutely no faith that anybody will respond.”

The Labour MP David Lammy, who lost a friend in the fire, tweeted: “I wonder if Sir Martin Moore-Bick has ever visited one of our inner-city tower blocks. If not, I hope that he will do so soon.”



He later deleted the tweet. Lisa Nandy, another Labour MP, drew parallels with the troubled start to the child abuse inquiry, which was chaired by four different individuals in its first two years amid distrust of the victims.

Lisa Nandy (@lisanandy) This feels worryingly similar to the child abuse inquiry. The Grenfell Inquiry must have the confidence of survivors https://t.co/pqS5S0C5PU

Grenfell survivors had wanted a say in the appointment of the chair of the inquiry but this was refused by the prime minister, who cited rules governing such inquiries.

In the 2014 case, Moore-Bick said Westminster council could rehouse Titina Nzolameso, a single mother with five children, more than 50 miles away in Milton Keynes. He ruled that it was not necessary for Westminster to explain in detail what other accommodation was available and that it could take “a broad range of factors” into account, including the pressures on the council, in deciding what housing was available.

Following the ruling, Jayesh Kunwardia, of Hodge Jones & Allen Solicitors, which represented Nzolameso, said: “This judgment could have dire consequences for vulnerable families across the country.

“It gives the green light for councils to engage in social cleansing of the poor on a mass scale. Council tenants are being threatened with homelessness unless they agree to uproot themselves from communities they’ve lived in for years.”

Survivors and the families of those who died in the devastating blaze will be given state funding for legal representation at the inquiry. The prime minister said a full judge-led inquiry was needed to ensure that the events at the 24-storey block were “properly investigated”.



In his commercial work and at the appeal court, Moore-Bick dealt with some housing cases, although his main area of expertise was to do with contracts, insurance and banking.

Jolyon Maugham QC, who is advising some of the families of the victims, said Moore-Bick and the government need to convince survivors that they will be heard.

Speaking to the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire programme he said: “People want to feel that they are involved in the process.” He also listed key questions for the judge and the government: “Is there going to be discussion with Grenfell community leaders about the nature of the terms of reference? Are residents of Grenfell Tower and family members of the victims of the disaster going to be consulted on the choice of barrister who represents families and victims in the inquiry? Is the government really going to think about the difficulties that families of Grenfell victims face in trusting an establishment that we know has let them down?”

Maugham added: “These inquiries, which have the capacity to heal, also have the capacity to exacerbate harm and distrust and I desperately hope that is not what happens here.”

The shadow business minister, Jack Dromey, told Sky News that Moore-Bick needed to “command confidence on the part of those who went through purgatory”. He added: “Above all the test for me, whoever conducts this independent inquiry, has got to be acceptable to the families.”

Michael Mansfield QC said the government had failed to consult, repeating errors made when May announced an inquiry into child sexual abuse, and struggled to find a chair acceptable to survivors.

Mansfield said just last week residents from flats neighbouring Grenfell had written to the prime minister and the home secretary asking to be consulted about the public inquiry into the disaster.

Mansfield said: “Theresa May has rebuffed a request that went in last week, from the residents, saying: may we please be involved in the terms of reference and the appointment of the chair. It does not inspire confidence. It’s to do with justice being seen to be done. The child sexual abuse inquiry took four years and four chairs. They are doing exactly the same all over again. They don’t consult before or after. Consult with the people.”

Former British PM says ministers calling for public sector pay cap to be lifted wanted to spend money they might need in future

David Cameron has described critics of austerity as “selfish”, saying their calls to boost spending and raise public sector pay may appear compassionate but would simply saddle future generations with debt.

The comments triggered a furious response from Labour and the Lib Dems, who described the former prime minister as totally out of touch, claiming it was astonishing he could make the argument when nurses were turning to food banks to get by.

Cameron’s remarks could also reopen the wounds of the EU referendum as they were widely interpreted as an attack on the two most significant Vote Leave figures, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove.

The foreign secretary and environment secretary, whose successful Brexit campaign cost Cameron his political career, have both broken ranks in recent days to hint that the 1% public sector pay cap should be lifted.

Their comments, alongside cabinet level interventions by Justine Greening at education and Jeremy Hunt at health, have ramped up the pressure on Theresa May and the chancellor, Philip Hammond.

The pair have faced demands from dozens of MPs to ease the pain for families by raising pay and blocking school cuts after Jeremy Corbyn’s radical, anti-austerity Labour party stance secured gains in the general election.

Many feel action is urgent after a government-commissioned report suggested the average pay of teachers had fallen by £3 an hour in real terms, police officers by £2, while the wages of nurses have stagnated.

But Cameron used a speech in Seoul, South Korea, to come to his successor’s defence by saying it was too soon “to let spending and borrowing rip” because of the danger of future economic shocks.

“The opponents of so-called austerity couch their arguments in a way that make them sound generous and compassionate,” he told the Asia Leadership Conference. “They seek to paint the supporters of sound finances as selfish, or uncaring. The exact reverse is true.

“Giving up on sound finances isn’t being generous, it’s being selfish: spending money today that you may need tomorrow.”

His comments led to an angry response from opposition politicians who lined up to say that Cameron had no idea how much people were struggling – and suggested it was crass to use a well-paid speech to make the argument.

The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, accused the senior Conservative figure of living “in a different world from the rest of us”.

“Only David Cameron would say that hard-working people seeing their living standards fall back and their pay suppressed is good for them. It just further shows how out of touch he was then, and still remains today.”

The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, described it as a “pretty rich for a multimillionaire to tell our hard-working firefighters, paramedics, nurses and doctors that they don’t deserve a pay rise”.

“But I guess you would think that if you are jetsetting around the world to give highly paid speeches – you don’t really understand how millions of public sector workers have to scrimp each month to get by,” he added, giving examples of nurses visiting foodbanks and asking how Cameron considered them to be “paid enough”.

A spokesman would not say how much the former Tory leader had received for the speaking engagement, but confirmed that he was paid.

The shadow Treasury minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said Cameron was “completely out of touch and has no awareness of the country he used to lead”.

But Cameron is not the only one to urge calm within the Tory party after a public spat at the top of government over the issue of public sector pay.

Sources said that the chief whip, Gavin Williamson, had been speaking to colleagues about the need for “unity and discipline” with a number of one-on-one meetings with cabinet ministers.

The former work and pensions secretary, Stephen Crabb, suggested it was wrong for such senior figures to speak out so publicly against government policy.



Nigel Lawson, a former chancellor under Margaret Thatcher, said it was Hammond’s job to keep control of public spending to avoid “economic disaster”.

“It’s not easy but it is necessary,” he told the BBC. “People understand we need to pay our way on the road to economic success.” He argued that the arguments needed to happen in private. “Stop having this debate in public, it’s ludicrous.”

Hammond also tried to defuse the row by calling on his party to “hold its nerve”, claiming that the only way to free up spending was higher taxes, more borrowing or stronger growth.

Like Cameron, the chancellor has argued that borrowing piles debt on to the next generation and has insisted the Tories are a party of low tax.

He has said growth was the only sustainable way to boost public spending in the long run, although sources suggest he is ready to talk about ways to raise money to loosen the ties of austerity over the coming months.

One senior Treasury figure said despite that, things would continue to be financially constrained in the run-up to Brexit.

Rises of 1% for dentists, nurses, doctors and the military have already been agreed for this year, and Downing Street said ministers would respond to other pay review recommendations within days. Teachers, police and prison officers are next in line.

It came alongside a call from civil servants to ensure that any lifting of salaries also included them.

Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union that represents senior managers and professionals in public service said his members would welcome “warm words from a number of cabinet ministers over lifting the public sector pay cap.

“But warm words won’t pay the bills. The majority of civil servants are not covered by pay review bodies and so those very same ministers have it within their control to lift the pay cap for civil servants in their department.

“We have today written to those ministers, calling on them to follow up their words with action. If they believe the pay cap should be lifted, then they can begin with the civil servants in their departments who support them as ministers and deliver vital public services.”

It is 19 years since BBC television ceased broadcasting live Test cricket and 12 since Channel 4 drew stumps on its own free-to-air coverage. Since then, Sky has had the monopoly of rights to what was once the national summer game. This will change a bit in 2020, when the BBC will start showing highlights, and some live T20 games, with Sky retaining the bulk of the rights.

Yet for many, free-to-air cricket coverage is now synonymous with radio’s Test Match Special. On Thursday, as Test cricket resumes for the first time in this English summer, TMS marks its 60th year of ball-by-ball radio commentaries. This deserves salute from the paper of John Arlott, even while recognising that TMS is a Marmite taste that some adore and others dislike.

Many are devoted to TMS’s gentle rhythms in spite of the male public school tone that still lingers. Others want it to converse better with today’s Britain. The tension between tradition and innovation will always shape responses to TMS and cricket itself.

In a Wisden survey of TMS’s role in the game, Matthew Engel this year highlighted an important truth. While televised sport’s relentless underlying dogma, especially in Sky’s treatment, is always that “this is thrilling and it really matters”, he wrote, radio’s values are subtler. On radio, “there is a tacit pact with the listener, who will be registering the cricket as an agreeable extra in their own daily routine”. Exactly so. Just as there is more to life than politics, so there is also more to life than cricket. But it’s good to welcome TMS back for the summer.

Tom Harrison, the chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board, has heralded its £1.1bn broadcast deal with Sky and the BBC as a “game-changer” for the sport and one that, in an era of increasing player power, will mean professionals are better paid than ever before.

The ECB on Friday announced a five-year deal to run from 2020 to 2024, with Sky having beaten off competition from its subscription rival BT Sport to retain rights to all international and domestic cricket in England but with 10 matches from the ECB’s new Twenty20 competition and two men’s international Twenty20s to also be screened on the BBC.

This combined £220m-a-year deal is worth nearly three times the £75m Sky now pays for its exclusive rights, with the new free-to-air element representing a tacit admission by the ECB the subscription-only model in place since 2006 has shrunk the sport’s place both in the national conversation and in terms ofgrassroots participation.

“It’s a game-changer for cricket in this country, a groundbreaking moment for us and we’re extremely excited,” said Harrison at Lord’s on Friday. “We set out 18 months ago to get a balance of reach, revenue and exposure. The balance of those three things was the driver behind what was a very long process.”

News of this windfall for the English game came on the same day that nine months of acrimonious contract talks between Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers’ Association hit a new low, with more than 200 professionals now technically unemployed after their memorandum of understanding expired on 30 June.

The Australian board is looking to end 20 years of paying a fixed 20% of its overall revenue to international and domestic cricketers and switch to set, capped salaries and a share of any surplus. The union, with the backing of its elite players including the international captains Steve Smith and Meg Lanning, is refusing to budge because domestic players would be worse off.

While the central contracts for England internationals – in place for the men since 2000 – are already an agreed amount rather than calculated by a share model, news of a near three-fold increase in television money could mean wage demands increase at all levels of the game.

One agent said it will soon be time for the Professional Cricketers’ Association to show it is ready to “step up and fight” for better pay from top internationals to the bottom of the county system but it is a topic Harrison claims to be relaxed about at present. He said: “The players played a big role in getting us to this point by playing attractive cricket which means attractive content and we’re always doing what we can to remunerate them. The players have got reason to be cheerful about this deal. It’s right and proper we reflect the value they bring to the game and that they’re remunerated accordingly. But it’s also important investment stays in the game and we get to where we’re going as a game.”

The new broadcast deal sees Sky retained as the chief partner with rights to all domestic and home international cricket, both televised and in the form of online clips, with plans afoot for a dedicated channel. The BBC will also be able to show clips on digital platforms and social media, and will take over prime-time international highlights from Channel 5.

The corporation, which last showed live cricket in 1999, will share the final of the new Twenty20 competition with Sky as one of its 10 live matches, as well as showing two England men’s T20 internationals and one women’s international. It also has televised rights for “up to” eight matches in the women’s Super League, with Test Match Special remaining the radio broadcaster for all international cricket after seeing off competition from TalkSport.

By increasing TV revenue so significantly, the ECB will be able to meet its promised £1.3m a year payments to each of the 18 counties in exchange for voting through the as-yet unnamed Twenty20 tournament from 2020 onwards that will feature eight new regional teams based at the major international venues.

This tournament, which will run at the height of summer and alongside the existing T20 Blast county competition, is intended to bring cricket to a new audience. By having some matches on BBC television, the ECB hopes it can deliver on this goal and feed into its All Stars Cricket participation programme aimed at bring 50,000 children into the sport.

Sky, which still has two years to run on its deal and the rights for ICC global events such as the World Cup until 2023, has also pledged to increase its involvement, claiming it will work with the ECB to promote the sport “at all levels” by drawing on experience from its Sky Ride initiative in cycling.

BT Sport aims to expand its cricket coverage with bids for overseas rights such as the current £16m deal with Cricket Australia that will allow it to broadcast this winter’s Ashes and the Big Bash Twenty20 league.

Gary Ballance has been recalled to the England Test team for the series opener against South Africa at Lord’s on Thursday and will bat at No3 in a move that takes Joe Root down one place to his favourite position in what will be his first match as captain, while Middlesex’s Toby Roland-Jones could make his debut on familiar turf.

England may turn to Gary Ballance again but bowling remains the problem | Vic Marks Read more

Ballance was dropped after the two-Test series in Bangladesh last winter and spent the 4-0 defeat in India that followed at the end of the year as an unused squad player. But after a run-soaked start to the season as the new Yorkshire captain, where he averages 101 in the County Championship, another crack at the international level has been granted.

Root had pushed for his county team-mate to be recalled and by placing the left-hander at first drop, where the new captain was stationed previously, the England selectors have given Keaton Jennings the green light to continue alongside Alastair Cook at the top of the order and opted against a recall for Haseeb Hameed.

Hameed shone during his first three Tests in India but after suffering the broken hand that gave Jennings his chance – one the Durham man took with a century on debut in Mumbai – the 20-year-old has since struggled for Championship runs at Lancashire, where he averages 15 against the red ball this summer.

A more surprising incumbent to be retained from the last time England played – a crushing innings and 75-run defeat in Chennai that led to Alastair Cook stepping down as captain and Root stepping up – is Liam Dawson, Hampshire’s spin-bowling all-rounder. Dawson was seen as a horses-for-courses selection at the time, having been added to the squad mid-tour due to Zafar Ansari’s injury, but impressed the management with the unbeaten 66 he made in his maiden Test innings. He could now slot in at No8 but, with doubts over Ben Stokes’s ability to bowl full pelt amid knee trouble, equally a debut could go to Roland-Jones.

The uncapped Middlesex seamer would therefore make up a five-man seam attack, along with Durham’s fast bowler Mark Wood, also earning his first Test call-up since 2015 when he left the tour of the United Arab Emirates for the first of three ankle operations.



With Stuart Broad and James Anderson set to resume new-ball duties following respective heel and groin injuries in recent weeks, the final make-up of the attack to face South Africa for the first of four Tests will therefore depend on whether Root wants extra spin or seam at his disposal.

James Whitaker, the national selector, said: “Gary Ballance has been in fantastic touch with the bat. We feel that he will add maturity and experience to our middle-order.

“Toby Roland-Jones is a player we have been monitoring for quite some time and deserves his chance after a strong couple of seasons with Middlesex in red ball cricket. He came close last year when he was named in the Test squad against Pakistan in July.

“Toby has been in good form this campaign and his ability to seam the ball along with the fact that he can score useful runs down the order gives us a number of options.”

Sir Vince Cable calls deal between British electronic payment company and US rival ‘cheap pickings’ after Brexit-vote devaluation of pound

Worldpay, which handles 40% of all card payments at tills in Britain, has agreed to a £7.7bn potential takeover by US rival in a move that has rekindled the debate about foreign takeovers.

The cash-and-shares offer makes Worldpay the latest British company to be snapped up by a foreign buyer after the Brexit vote, which triggered a sharp fall in the value of the pound.

Cambridge-based Arm Holdings was bought by Japan’s SoftBank for £24bn last July, and other deals include the engineering group WS Atkins, which was bought by Canada’s SNC-Lavalin for £2.1bn in April.

The Worldpay deal was announced after intense talks through Tuesday night following its admission that it had been approached by Vantiv and JP Morgan Chase, driving its shares up 28%.

On Wednesday, after Worldpay said it had agreed terms about a “possible offer” with Vantiv, JP Morgan pulled out and Worldpay’s shares ended 8% lower at 372p – the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100.

Sir Vince Cable, running to be leader of the Liberal Democrats and former business secretary, tweeted: “Another top British company #Worldpay at risk following #Arm. Cheap pickings after #Brexit vote devaluation. Need reform #TAKEOVER rule.”



Vince Cable (@vincecable) Another top British company #Worldpay at risk following #Arm. Cheap pickings after #Brexit vote devaluation. Need reform #TAKEOVER rules.

“From a British perspective, it’s a shame to see another ground-breaking UK tech company selling out to overseas competition, perhaps before reaching full potential on its own,” said Jasper Lawler, head of research at financial firm London Capital Group.

The payments sector is experiencing a period of rapid growth, as more people shift from cash to paying by card and online, which is sparking takeovers. Over the weekend, Nets, the Danish payments services company, said it had been approached by potential suitors.

The rise of contactless cards has further accelerated the trend, becoming a popular payment method for lower-value transactions that were traditionally dominated by cash. Figures from the British Retail Consortium show that cash was used for less than half of all UK retail transactions for the first time in 2015.

Worldpay has been listed on the stock market since 2015 and if the deal goes ahead, its shares will be delisted and the combined group will continue with Vantiv’s listing in New York. Worldpay shareholders would own about 41% of the new group.

The value of the deal varies with Vantiv’s share price but when it was announced it valued Worldpay shares at 385p each, including a 5p dividend. This is a 19% premium on their value on Monday, the day before the British company confirmed the approaches.

The premium is lower than that offered in recent deals, such as the 40% offered for Arm. “It looks like it’s smaller than the market was expecting,” said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

Details of the cost savings that might be achieved were not announced, but Worldpay said: “The boards of Worldpay and Vantiv see a compelling strategic, commercial and financial rationale for combining Worldpay and Vantiv’s complementary businesses.

“The potential merger creates a scale world-class payments group in a dynamic market … It will serve a wide range of customers, with a strong position in the four core regions of the US, Europe, Asia-Pacific and South America.”

Worldpay shareholders should decline its meek merger deal Read more

It is thought Worldpay and Vantiv could operate from dual headquarters in London and Cincinnati, where the companies are respectively based. While there is little overlap between the two businesses in Britain and Europe, there is a greater crossover in the US.



“The boards of Worldpay and Vantiv have identified substantial opportunities for cost synergies, which support significant potential shareholder value creation,” Worldpay said.

It was unclear on Wednesday whether a deal would result in job losses at the combined group, or how it might affect Worldpay’s various British offices. The company has 5,000 staff in London, Manchester, Cambridge and Gateshead.

Vantiv will dominate the board with seven members, including Charles Drucker as executive chairman and co-chief executive. Four Worldpay directors will join the board of the new group, including Philip Jansen as co-chief executive and Sir Michael Rake, BT chairman and former Barclays deputy chairman, in a non-executive role.

Launched in 1989, Worldpay provides the technology that allows retailers and other business to accept card payments and online or mobile transactions. It was previously owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, which sold the business in 2010 to private equity firms Advent and Bain Capital as part of the terms of the bank’s 2008 taxpayer bailout.

London’s Royal Free hospital failed to comply with the Data Protection Act when it handed over personal data of 1.6 million patients to DeepMind, a Google subsidiary, according to the Information Commissioner’s Office.

The data transfer was part of the two organisation’s partnership to create the healthcare app Streams, an alert, diagnosis and detection system for acute kidney injury. The ICO’s ruling was largely based on the fact that the app continued to undergo testing after patient data was transferred. Patients, it said, were not adequately informed that their data would be used as part of the test.

“Our investigation found a number of shortcomings in the way patient records were shared for this trial,” said Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner. “Patients would not have reasonably expected their information to have been used in this way, and the Trust could and should have been far more transparent with patients as to what was happening.

“We’ve asked the Trust to commit to making changes that will address those shortcomings, and their co-operation is welcome. The Data Protection Act is not a barrier to innovation, but it does need to be considered wherever people’s data is being used.”

The ICO ruled that testing the app with real patient data went beyond Royal Free’s authority, particularly given how broad the scope of the data transfer was. “A patient presenting at accident and emergency within the last five years to receive treatment or a person who engages with radiology services and who has had little or no prior engagement with the Trust would not reasonably expect their data to be accessible to a third party for the testing of a new mobile application, however positive the aims of that application may be,” the office said in its findings.

While privacy campaigners were hoping the ruling would touch on the continued use of patient data for the production version of Streams, the ICO was muted on the live use of Streams in a clinical environment, but warned that “concerns regarding the necessity and proportionality of the use of the sensitive data of 1.6 million patients remain”.

The Royal Free has been asked to commission a third-party audit of the trial following the ruling, complete a privacy assessment, set out how it will better comply with its duties in future trials and establish a proper legal basis for the DeepMind project.

In a statement, the hospital trust said: “We are pleased that the information commissioner … has allowed us to continue using the app which is helping us to get the fastest treatment to our most vulnerable patients – potentially saving lives.

“We accept the ICO’s findings and have already made good progress to address the areas where they have concerns. For example, we are now doing much more to keep our patients informed about how their data is used. We would like to reassure patients that their information has been in our control at all times and has never been used for anything other than delivering patient care or ensuring their safety.”

The ruling does not directly criticise DeepMind, a London-based AI company purchased by Google in 2013, since the ICO views the Royal Free as the “data controller” responsible for upholding the data protection act throughout its partnership with Streams, with DeepMind acting as a data processor on behalf of the trust.

In a blogpost, the company said: “We welcome the ICO’s thoughtful resolution of this case, which we hope will guarantee the ongoing safe and legal handling of patient data for Streams.

“Although today’s findings are about the Royal Free, we need to reflect on our own actions too. In our determination to achieve quick impact when this work started in 2015, we underestimated the complexity of the NHS and of the rules around patient data, as well as the potential fears about a well-known tech company working in health.

“We were almost exclusively focused on building tools that nurses and doctors wanted, and thought of our work as technology for clinicians rather than something that needed to be accountable to and shaped by patients, the public and the NHS as a whole. We got that wrong, and we need to do better.”

The company highlighted a number of changes it had made since the launch of Streams, including a significant increase in transparency, and the creation of a independent health review board.

Streams has since been rolled out to other British hospitals, and DeepMind has also branched out into other clinical trials, including a project aimed at using machine-learning techniques to improve diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, and another aimed at using similar techniques to better prepare radiotherapists for treating head and neck cancers.

Met says trial is being widened because a successful pilot scheme was too limited – but critics say hoods breach people’s rights

A trial of the controversial police spit hoods, which came to national attention after one was used on an innocent man during an arrest last year, has been extended across the whole of London, Scotland Yard has said.

Officers said an initial smaller pilot in the north-east of the capital had been successful but was too limited.

The police watchdog is investigating British Transport Police’s use of a spit hood on Ik Aihie, who was arrested in London Bridge station in July 2016. He was filmed screaming as he was held down by officers, who put the hood over his head. Aihie said he had been left “bruised and shaken” and a witness said he had been treated “like a dog”.

He was never charged with anything and a caution issued to him was later revoked.

Use of the hoods has been claimed to breach a suspect’s rights. The Met argues they offer reasonable protection to officers against people trying to spit at and bite them.

The force plans to extend the use of the hoods to all custody suites in the capital, though their use was restricted on the streets from the outset. It said it had “discussed these plans with partner organisations, community representatives and independent groups, as well as magistrates”.

On Thursday, the force said the initial trial had suggested that the spit guards were an “effective, proportionate and necessary piece of equipment when deployed correctly and with appropriate supervision”. It said the mayor of London had agreed to the extension.

“The Met has a duty of care to its officers and staff – the issue of spitting and biting is a real problem and a particularly unpleasant form of assault which rightly generates a lot of concern amongst officers. Aside from the fact that as an employer the Met cannot expect its staff to be spat at, or think this is acceptable, some of the follow-up treatment required after such an assault can be prolonged and unpleasant.



“Over a number of years, the Met has been looking at potential ways of minimising the threat this issue poses to officers and staff. One of the options that has been considered is spit guards. Spit guards are a nationally approved piece of police personal safety equipment and are already used by 22 forces across the UK.”

Martha Spurrier, Director of Liberty, called the hoods “primitive, cruel and dangerous.” She went on: “There have been far too many cases of their use against children and disabled adults, causing huge fear, humiliation and even suffocation – which makes it all the more disturbing to see the Met quietly roll this extreme measure out across our city, with no public debate and no published evaluation. If the pilot was ‘successful’, why can’t we see the evidence?”

More than 1.2 million people are expected to be living with dementia in England and Wales by 2040, up from almost 800,000 today, research suggests.

Researchers say the predicted rise in the prevalence of dementia is largely down to people living longer, but add that the figures also show that the risk of developing dementia for each age group is falling – a finding they say suggests that preventive strategies are having an impact.



Drop in dementia rates suggests disease can be prevented, researchers say Read more

“The growth in numbers of cases of dementia is not as large as we once anticipated,” said Sara Ahmadi-Abhari, an epidemiologist and co-author of the research from University College, London. “But, nonetheless, the growth in the number of people with dementia is substantial.”

The team note that improved forecasts for the numbers of people expected to be living with dementia in the future are important to make sure support is available. At present the costs of dementia to the UK economy are estimated to be £23bn a year.

The latest figures, published in the British Medical Journal, are based on data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (Elas) – an ongoing project that began in 2002 and is designed to look at a range of factors affecting people aged 50 and over, including their health.



Among the assessments carried out, participants were asked to complete memory tasks, solve maths problems and were asked about their ability to carry out daily activities, with any diagnosis of dementia also recorded.

The international team of researchers examined data from 18,000 men and women collected between 2002 and 2013, to look at trends in the proportion of new cases of dementia and the prevalence of the condition and cardiovascular disease over time. In addition, data from the Office for National Statistics was combined with data from the Elas to help the team to explore trends in mortality from both cardiovascular disease and non-cardiovascular causes.

“Dementia and cardiovascular disease share risk factors,” said Ahmadi-Abhar. “To be able to get a better picture of the health gains [of public health interventions], we need to model them together.”



The team then fed the data into a computer-based model to predict figures for those living with dementia in England and Wales in the years to come.

The findings reveal that both the incidence and prevalence of dementia for each age group is falling, but as prevalence remains highest among the oldest, and more people are living longer, overall prevalence and the number of people living with the dementia is on the rise.

“There is very little doubt that we are going to see an increase in the actual number of people with dementia,” said Julie Williams, an associate director of the UK Dementia Research Institute at Cardiff University who was not involved in the study. But she adds there are signs of hope. “It is heartening that we see a reduction in the rate, which is likely to be due to healthy living,” she said.

Ramon Luengo-Fernandez of the Health Economics Research Centre at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the research, said that the study underscores the importance of central and local government tackling the social care crisis in older age.

“Although the pressures created by dementia to the NHS, social services and society in general – for example, impact on relatives who have to care for people with dementia in the community – might not be as bad as once feared, the study highlights that these pressures will still be considerable,” he said.

The research comes at the same time as a number of other investigations into dementia.

Among them, a small study published in the journal Neurology has found that among participants with an elevated risk of Alzheimer’s, those who reported poorer sleep quality had more biomarkers associated with the disease in their spinal fluid.



But, the authors note, it is not clear if the sleep problems are increasing the risk of developing the disease or vice versa.

Another study, published in the journal Nature, has unravelled the structure of filaments that are found tangled inside cells in the brain of those with Alzheimer’s, and are made of a protein known as tau.



By revealing the different structures of these tau filaments, researchers say they hope to be better able to understand how and why they tangle, which in turn could eventually lead to development of drugs to prevent such clumps developing.

John Hardy, professor of neuroscience at University College, London who was not involved in the research, welcomed the study. “This is a fantastic piece of work which will help us understand the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s better,” he said. “It really is a tour de force.”

The enforced removal of some people from Britain on escorted chartered flights falls short of humane treatment, with some leaving the country in waist restraint belts or leg restraints almost as a default, according to an official watchdog.

The first annual report from the independent monitoring board covering charter flight deportations says that people being deported were generally treated fairly on Home Office charter flights but some aspects of their enforced removal fell short of providing basic dignity.

The board’s report on removals in 2016 highlighted the use of force or restraint, which in some cases “appears to be a hasty reaction to a mild statement to the escorts of unwillingness to leave”. Often the restraint is not removed until after the aircraft takes off.

The work of the monitoring board was formally approved by Home Office ministers in 2015. It came after the death of Jimmy Mubenga, who suffocated after being restrained by three G4S security guards in his seat during his enforced removal from Britain. The removals are now carried out by a different escorting contractor, Tascor.

The report covers the treatment of those being removed on six charter flights in 2016 to Lagos, Accra, Jamaica, Islamabad and Tirana. The watchdog found that those being removed had to endure long periods of up to seven hours of detention on coaches before their removal.

They also faced being denied dignity and privacy while using toilet facilities and had inconsistent access to the chief immigration officer present on every flight with the private security staff deciding who was allowed to get official advice about their cases.

The report reveals that on every flight some returnees left the UK under physical restraint. The flight to Jamaica in September 2016 saw 26 out of the 42 people being removed leaving in restraints. In most cases this involved the use of a waist restraint belt but a few were also placed in leg restraints. Those who refused to wear the waist belts could also be handcuffed first.

The monitoring board says it remains concerned about the extent of the use of force and restraint in the Jamaica operation despite Home Office explanations in which 66% of those being returned were restrained.

The Jamaica flight was described in advance as “potentially problematic” and the watchdog wonders “whether the operation may have been talked up to Tascor staff to such an extent that approved restraint techniques were deployed almost as a default reaction, erring on the side of caution rather than individually assessed and each judged to be necessary, reasonable and proportionate.”

The monitoring board reports that despite the high use of waist belts the flight passed off peacefully, although one deportee who had been discharged directly from prison remained in his belt until the flight landed.

CQC finds 32% of facilities in England inadequate or in need of improvement and says social care in ‘precarious’ state

One in three nursing homes has failed its official inspection in results described by the care watchdog as worrying and by the government’s care minister as “completely unacceptable”.

The Care Quality Commission said that of 4,000 nursing homes, which care for the most vulnerable people at the end of their lives, 32% have been rated inadequate or requires improvement and 37% have been told they must improve safety.

The regulator warned that social care was in a “precarious” state – and according to Age UK the results leave elderly people and their families “playing Russian roulette” when they choose a nursing home or other care service.

Inspectors making unannounced visits to care homes found medicines being administered unsafely, alarm calls going unanswered and residents not getting help to eat or use the toilet. Some residents were found to have been woken up by night-shift care workers, washed and then put back to bed, apparently to make life easier for staff.



Vulnerable people left 'betrayed' by England's care and nursing homes Read more

Andrea Sutcliffe, chief inspector of adult social care at the Care Quality Commission, which carried out the inspections, said such practice showed a fundamental lack of dignity and respect. She admitted disappointment that only one in 50 of all care services had managed to achieve the top rating of “outstanding”.

The picture for nursing homes was the most worrying, Sutcliffe said. “Many of these homes are struggling to recruit and retain well-qualified nursing staff and that means that this is having an impact on delivering good services to people who have got very complex needs,” she said.

In a separate interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, she said the commission would shut down failing homes that refused to improve.

Where serious failings had occurred, including where staff had been violent towards people in their care, Sutcliffe said the commission would be looking at training and recruitment issues. “How are they making sure they are recruiting the right kind of people who can give the right kind of service?”

The report of the full inspection results will pile pressure on ministers over both the growing crisis in the national nursing workforce – revealed this week to be shrinking amid discontent over pay and workloads – and state spending on social care, cut by a cumulative £6bn in England since 2010.



Of all adult 24,000 social care services in England, 21% have been judged “inadequate” or “requires improvement” in the first full checks of their kind by the Care Quality Commission – which have taken almost three years to complete. One quarter of those checked have been found wanting on grounds of safety.

Sutcliffe said care was “approaching its tipping point” – as the CQC warned last autumn – despite an emergency injection of £2bn government funding over three years.



Concern has grown because some services have been downgraded after re-inspection. Of more than 1,800 inspected more than once since 2014, 26% were subsequently relegated to “requires improvement” or even “inadequate” after initially gaining a rating of “good”.

Sutcliffe said that while re-inspections were often prompted by concerns raised by staff, other care professionals or users of the services, the number of facilities downgraded nevertheless underscored the fragility of the sector.

Caroline Abrahams, Age UK’s charity director, said it was troubling that a fifth of all services had been judged to need improvement and “pretty scary” that so many nursing homes had fallen below an acceptable threshold.

With a quarter of services deemed insuffiently safe, older people and their families were “now effectively playing Russian roulette when they need care,” she said.

Referring to the government’s manifesto pledge of a green paper on the future of social care, Abrahams said: “Taken as a whole, this report is a graphic demonstration of why older people desperately need the government to follow through on its commitment to consult on proposals for strengthening social care later this year.”

Jackie Doyle-Price, the newly appointed minister for social care, said: “While this report shows that the vast majority of people receive ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ adult social care, it is completely unacceptable that standards in some settings are below those rightly expected by care users and their families.”

All registered social care services in England have now been inspected on grounds of safety, effectiveness, whether they are caring, whether responsive and quality of leadership.

While nursing homes come out worst, services grouped as “community social care” emerge best. These include sheltered housing with “extra-care” support and so-called “shared lives” schemes whereby people accept others needing care and support into their own homes.

By region, the east of England has the best overall results and the north-west the worst. By size, small care homes and homecare services emerge far better than large ones – three times as many large care homes, with 50 or more beds, being judged inadequate or requiring improvement than small ones with up to 10.

Government abdicating responsibility for social care, say providers Read more

Sutcliffe said that although some big homes had proved they could provide outstanding care, smaller homes were often better at the personal touch and at retaining experienced staff.

Nicola O’Brien, head of policy and campaigns at Alzheimer’s Society, said the inspection results suggested that thing had got even worse for people with dementia since the CQC’s “approaching tipping point” warning.



“Too often we hear the consequences of inadequate care – our investigation last year revealed people with dementia left in soiled sheets, or becoming ill after eating out-of-date food, and that only a third of homecare workers have received dementia training, leaving families fearing for their loved ones.”

Without adequate funding, it was no surprise that care providers were being forced to cut corners, O’Brien said. “We need to see government act before the care system collapses, with clear detail on consultation for reform that is backed up with action.”

Barbara Keeley, Labour’s shadow minister for social care, said: “This report confirms that the social care funding crisis caused by this government is now seriously affecting the quality of care across the country.

“It is deeply worrying that a quarter of social care services have safety concerns. Behind these statistics are thousands of vulnerable adults failing to get the medicines they have been prescribed, being ignored when they ask for help or having home visits missed.”

Gallery is praised for creating new prize for sculpture and staging string of ‘breathtaking’ exhibitions

The Hepworth Wakefield art gallery in West Yorkshire has been named winner of the world’s biggest museum prize after a year of “breathtaking” exhibitions, booming visitor numbers and the creation of an important award for contemporary sculpture.

The gallery, housed in a David Chipperfield-designed concrete building on the banks of the river Calder, opened in 2011 and has punched above its weight ever since.

It was named 2017 Art Fund museum of the year on Wednesday from a shortlist that included the vast Tate Modern to the tiny Lapworth Museum of Geology in Birmingham.

Judges hailed the success of the gallery’s inaugural Hepworth prize for sculpture and the strength of the exhibition programme as reasons for it winning the £100,000 prize.

Stephen Deuchar, the Art Fund director who chaired the judging panel, said it was “the museum everyone would dream of having on their doorstep”.

He added: “The Hepworth Wakefield was a powerful force of energy from the moment it opened in 2011, but it has just kept growing in reach and impact ever since.”

The new prize for sculpture “earned instant national status”, he said, while the exhibition programme, including a Stanley Spencer retrospective and a Martin Parr photography show, had been “breathtaking”.

“The Hepworth serves its local community with unfailing flair and dedication and contributes centrally to regional tourism too, bringing 210,275 visitors in 2016, up 21% on the previous year,” Deuchar said.

The prize was presented at the British Museum by the Radio 2 DJ Jo Whiley, who was one of the judges. She said travelling across the UK and “discovering places that were completely new to me has really opened my eyes to the incredible work that UK museums are doing.

“Any one of the shortlisted museums would have been a worthy winner, and the pressure was very much on in making this tough decision … but in the end we all agreed that the Hepworth Wakefield was a worthy winner.”

Accepting the prize the museum’s director Simon Wallis thanked the Hepworth staff for their “unflagging enthusiasm” as well as visitors, artists and the district council. “Wakefield has suffered economically, socially, it has had more than its fair share of troubles over a long period of time and the fantastic reinvention of the city has been part of our story … we are a major part of that,” he said.



The gallery, backed by a progressive council that recognised the benefits of investing in the arts, was named in honour of the Wakefield-born sculptor Barbara Hepworth.

Together with the Henry Moore Institute in Leeds and the Yorkshire Sculpture Park – museum of the year winner in 2014 – the Hepworth has helped make Yorkshire a world centre for sculpture.

Last year’s fifth anniversary events were particularly striking because of their scale and ambition.

The Hepworth identified a gap in the plethora of visual arts awards and created a biennial £30,000 prize for achievement in sculpture. Importantly, it did not have an age limit, a contrast to the Turner prize, which at the time had a cut-off of 50. This year the Turner prize followed suit, abolishing the age restriction on the grounds that all artists, no matter how old, were capable of having breakthrough moments.

The first Hepworth prize was won by Helen Marten, one of the UK’s most exciting artists, who went on to win the Turner prize.

Special exhibitions in 2016 included Parr’s documentary photographs of West Yorkshire’s rhubarb triangle, the 23 sq km (9 sq mile) area between Wakefield, Morley and Rothwell famous for producing early forced rhubarb.

The gallery is also custodian of Wakefield’s art collection, founded in 1923, of more than 5,000 works by artists who include Hepworth, Moore, David Bomberg, Ben Nicholson and Paul Nash.

For the first time, each of the shortlisted museums losing out on the main prize will receive £10,000. They are Tate Modern, which last year opened its £260m 10-storey extension; Sir John Soane’s Museum in London; the National Heritage Centre for Horseracing and Sporting Art in Newmarket; and Lapworth.

Theresa May raised the spectre of a Greek-style economic collapse if Britain fails to press ahead with tackling the deficit on Wednesday, as she was challenged repeatedly by Jeremy Corbyn over the public sector pay cap.

With intense political pressure on the prime minister – including from her own cabinet colleagues – to ease the strain for cash-strapped public servants, including nurses and teachers, she warned MPs about the risks of loosening the purse strings.

“This is not a theoretical issue. Let us look at those countries that failed to deal with it. In Greece, where they have not dealt with the deficit ... What did we see with that failure to deal with the deficit? Spending on the health service cut by 36%. That does not help nurses or patients,” she said.

PMQs verdict: Corbyn goes on offensive as May channels Osborne Read more

Comparisons with Greece were repeatedly used by George Osborne in 2010 to justify public spending cuts, as riots erupted on the streets of Athens over the stringent bailout conditions imposed by the International Monetary Fund and the eurozone.

But the analogy represented a significant ratcheting up of the pro-austerity argument from May.

A Conservative spokesman emphasised remarks afterwards, saying: “There are siren calls from Labour to abandon any kind of fiscal restraint whatsoever. What happens, we’ve seen as a case study, is what happened in Greece.” He added: “I think she was suggesting if Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party got the chance to impose its fiscal policies on the United Kingdom that is a very real threat.”

A spokesman for Corbyn described the claims as “preposterous”. “The situation in Greece is tied up with the eurozone and the management of the eurozone banks – we’re not remotely in that situation. Our manifesto and our pledges were costed, unlike the government’s,” he said.

Many Conservative MPs have returned to Westminster after the bruising election campaign, determined to urge the government to allay some of the concerns about spending cuts they heard from voters – including on school funding, as well as public sector pay.

Some would like to see May give a clear signal before parliament breaks up for the summer recess on 20 July that the 1% across-the-board cap will be lifted.

The chief secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, must write a letter to the independent pay review bodies shortly, setting out their remit and would be expected to reinforce the 1% cap.

The Labour leader used all his questions to the prime minister at their weekly head to head to pressure her over issues of pay, accusing her of presiding over “a low-pay epidemic” in the UK, and claiming she had presided over “a week of flip-flopping and floundering”.

May outlined the process by which a series of pay review bodies recommend rises for NHS staff, teachers and others, and said the government would “consider those reports very carefully”. But she added: “We will always recognise the need to makes those decisions against the need to live within our means.” Both she and Corbyn valued the contribution of public sector workers, May said but added: “The difference is, I know we have to pay for them.”

Several other ministers and aides went on to echo the comparison with Greece in a sign there is a concerted effort by the Conservatives to stress their desire for “sound money” and attack Labour on the issue of economic competence.

Truss said the cap on public sector pay was the “responsible thing to do” in response to an urgent question from Labour.



Philip Hammond, who has admitted that he would have liked the economy to play a more central role in the election campaign, has resisted pressure to ease up on austerity, warning his cabinet colleagues that money to fund extra spending pledges would have to come from cuts elsewhere or tax increases.

One suggestion is that the Treasury could cancel planned tax cuts, including to the rate of corporation tax, as the Labour manifesto mooted. At 19%, the tax is already one of the lowest among major economies, but it is due to be reduced further, to 17%, in a move introduced by Osborne.

A thinktank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, calculates that scrapping the public sector pay cap altogether, as Labour would like to do, would cost government departments and local government £6.3bn per year compared with the government’s plans – increasing to £9.2bn per year by 2021–22.

Corbyn will give a speech to the British Chambers of Commerce on Thursday, calling for economic reform – including a greater role for the state in developing and promoting new technologies, to prevent another “lost decade” of weak growth.

He will argue that technological development, “can’t be left to the market”. “Technological change, from automation to decarbonisation, means that many jobs and industries will disappear or shrink in the coming years and decades. But I am not one of the doom-mongers, who believe that will inevitably herald an era of mass unemployment.

“At every stage of economic and industrial history, jobs, industries and skills have been lost, replaced and transformed. But whether that happens at huge social cost, as it did, for example, in the early days of the Industrial Revolution and the Luddites, or is embraced and benefits everybody, depends on managing and planning for technological change. We can’t simply leave it to the market.”

PM ‘found £1bn to keep her own job’ so why can’t find similar amount to keep nurses and teachers in their jobs, Labour leader asks

Jeremy Corbyn accused Theresa May of presiding over “a low-pay epidemic” in the UK as he used a noisy and boisterous prime minister’s questions to challenge her repeatedly over the continued cap on public sector pay.

Following a week in which several ministers have called for the cap to be eased, May vigorously defended continued austerity, saying it was more unfair still to “load debt on our children and grandchildren”.

The Labour leader used all his questions to pressure May over issues of pay. He began by noting the prime minister’s acknowledgement of the 69th anniversary of the NHS, adding: “I was hoping she was going to say a bit more about NHS staff and their pay during her birthday greetings.

“After a week of flip-flopping and floundering, we thought we’d got some clarity from Downing Street at last.”

May outlined the process by which a series of pay review bodies recommend rises for NHS staff, teachers and others, and said the government would “consider those reports very carefully”.

But she added: “We will always recognise the need to makes those decisions against the need to live within our means.” Both she and Corbyn valued the contribution of public sector workers, May said but added: “The difference is, I know we have to pay for them.”

May also claimed the UK could go the way of Greece if it does not keep controls on public spending in a defence of austerity that echoed the messages of David Cameron and George Osborne in the 2015 election.



Several other ministers and aides went on to echo that comparison with Greece in a sign there is a concerted effort by the Conservatives to stress their desire for “sound money” and attack Labour on the issue of economic competence.

“There are siren calls from Labour to abandon any kind of fiscal restraint whatsoever, and we’ve seen what happens,” a Conservative spokesman said after PMQs. “What happens, we’ve seen as a case study, is what happens in Greece, and as [the prime minister] pointed out, that saw a 36% reduction in health spending in Greece, and that is no good for nurses and doctors. I think she was suggesting if Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party got the chance to impose its fiscal policies on the United Kingdom that is a very real threat.”

A spokesman for Corbyn described the claims on Greece as “preposterous”.

“The situation in Greece is tied up with the eurozone and the management of the eurozone banks – we’re not remotely in that situation. Our manifesto and our pledges were costed, unlike the government’s,” he said.



Later, Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said the cap on public sector pay was the “responsible thing to do” in response to an urgent question from Labour.



“The process is very simple, we’ve received recommendations from pay review bodies already this year,” she said. “They make decisions based on the individual circumstances within those sectors, we have followed all of their recommendations, we will look at the further recommendations we need to make decisions on and we will look at that balance between affordability and making sure that we retain and recruit high quality public sector workers.



“But this is the right approach, it’s not saying that we’re going to open up the cheque book, bankrupt our public services and see people lose their jobs.”

But during PMQs, Corbyn argued the continued 1% pay limit was causing “real shortages in nursing and teaching” as well as hardship, and accused ministers of “recklessly exploiting the goodwill of public servants”.

Responding to May’s insistence that the government provided “good management of the economy”, Corbyn said: “The prime minister simply doesn’t get it. There is a low-pay epidemic in this country and it has a terrible effect on young people. Those in their 20s will earn £12,500 a year less than the generation that went before them – the first generation to be worse off than the last.

“They’re less likely to be able to buy their own homes, more likely to be saddled with debt, more likely to be in insecure, low-paid work. Except for more misery, what does the prime minister and her government actually offer for the young people of this country?”

Saying the UK was among the only nations where wages had not recovered since the economic crash, Corbyn said more people were using food banks and 4 million children were growing up in poverty.

He said: “The low-pay epidemic is a threat to our economic stability. So can she take some tough choices and instead of offering platitudes, offer some real help, and real support for those in work, young people who deserve better and deserve to be given more optimism rather than greater inequality?”

May responded vigorously, bringing cheers and cries of “more” from some backbenchers.

She said: “It isn’t fair to refuse to take tough decisions and to load debt on our children and grandchildren. It isn’t fair to bankrupt our economy, because that leads to people losing their jobs, and losing their homes.



“And it isn’t fair to go out and tell people that they can have all the public spending they want without paying for it.”

May was also attacked by Corbyn over the cost of her deal to win support from the Democratic Unionists. He said: “The prime minister found £1bn to keep her own job. Why can’t she find the same amount of money to keep nurses and teachers in their job, who after all serve all of us?”

In response, May taunted the Labour leader for calling his frontbench a “government in waiting”. She said: “We all know what that means: waiting to put up taxes, waiting to destroy jobs, waiting to bankrupt out country. We will never let it happen.”

HMP Frankland houses first of three units – ‘jihadi jails’ – after UK policy switches from dispersing terrorists to containing them

Some of the most dangerous and radicalised convicted extremists in the prison system have been moved out into the first of three special “jihadi jail” separation units across England and Wales.

The first specialist centre is at HMP Frankland near Durham. Two other centres, which are expected to be at HMP Full Sutton near York and at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire, are due to open in the coming months and the three centres together will hold up to 28 of the most subversive extremist prisoners in the system.

The government’s plans to isolate Islamist extremist prisoners from the mainstream high security jail population were first disclosed by the Guardian in February last year.

The Ministry of Justice said that more than 4,500 frontline officers have so far received specialist counter-extremism training to identify and challenge extremist views and hope that every prison officer will be trained.

The decision to isolate the most dangerous subversives to prevent them influencing others follows the Acheson report into Islamist extremism in prisons which recommended they be removed from the general prison population and given effective deradicalisation interventions.

The creation of the separate specialist units – dubbed jihadi jails – marks a break with the long-standing policy of dispersing convicted terrorist prisoners throughout the eight top security jails that make up the high security prison estate in England and Wales.

The Acheson review found that the dispersal policy was effective in managing the relatively small number of Irish Republican prisoners, who did not have even the passive support of other prisoners in English jails. But the dispersal policy had not been developed or changed in response to the emerging threat from Islamist extremism.

The maximum capacity of 28 prisoners is however far short of the latest figure of 186 prisoners in the system convicted of terrorist or extremist offences.

The Ministry of Justice said that those selected for separation in the specialist centres include those who have been involved in planning terrorism or are considered to pose a risk to national security. Those seeking to influence others to commit terrorist crimes, or whose extremist views are purposely undermining good order and security in the prison estate, may also be sent to the centres.

The prisons minister, Sam Gyimah, said: “Any form of extremism must be defeated wherever it is found, and it is right that we separate those who pose the greatest risk in order to limit their influence over other prisoners.



“These centres are a crucial part of our wider strategy to help tackle extremism in prisons and ensure the safety and security of both our prisons and the wider public.”

Charities have obtained supplies of the vaccine following a shortage last year but the government’s vaccination programme won’t resume until 2018

Wildlife charities have resumed vaccinating badgers against bovine TB after a global shortage of the vaccine caused it to be suspended last year.

But more badgers than ever before are set to be culled this summer as Wales follows England in introducing a targeted cull in a bid to reduce bovine TB.

While the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is not recommencing its badger vaccination programme until 2018, Derbyshire Wildlife Trust successfully obtained its own vaccine supplies after obtaining permission to import the InterVax TB vaccine from Canada.

Their success has helped other vaccination projects, including those of Chester Zoo, Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust and Berkshire, Buckinghamshire & Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust (BBOWT), acquire the vaccine. The Somerset Badger Group is also poised to resume vaccinating badgers in Somerset, Dorset, Wiltshire and Gloucestershire this summer.

Badgers have been trapped, injected with a vaccine and released by a growing number of wildlife groups as an alternative to England’s badger cull, which began in 2013 and has seen almost 15,000 badgers killed. The cull’s aim is to reduce bovine TB in cattle but in the 12 months to April this year, 30,079 cows were slaughtered because of the disease in England, up 4% on the previous year. Some scientists believe culling causes “perturbation”, where badgers roam more widely, potentially spreading more bovine TB across the countryside.

Derbyshire Wildlife Trust aim to vaccinate more than 100 badgers this year after so far vaccinating 30 badgers, including 12 cubs. They restarted their programme after the Derbyshire Wildlife Trust chair and veterinary surgeon, Dr Sue Mayer, secured the vaccine from a Canadian company.

“Unicef now say all country needs for human TB vaccine can be met so we wanted to start vaccinating badgers as soon as we could,” said Dr Mayer. “Vaccination is a better solution than culling which research indicates can spread the disease further. It’s also cheaper and avoids the indiscriminate killing of healthy animals.”

Tim Birch, who is leading Derbyshire Wildlife Trust’s vaccination effort, said the Trust was getting “more and more landowners and farmers” seeking to join their vaccination effort, rather than support badger culling.

“Once farmers see we are reasonable people, they can work with us,” said Birch. “We’re very resourceful and we’ve built up a real expertise and, through word of mouth, people genuinely respect what we do. We’ve been getting a lot of interest from farmers saying, ‘We don’t like the idea of culling, we’d like you to come on to our land and vaccinate badgers.’”

Derbyshire’s vaccination programme is currently working with farmers and landowners and groups including the National Trust, the National Farmers Union and the Country Land and Business Association (CLA). Other vaccinators are also working alongside small but growing numbers of farmers: the Somerset Badger Group is vaccinating badgers on 10 commercial farms.

An oral vaccine for badgers is still being developed by scientists and critics argue that trapping and injecting badgers is labour-intensive and expensive. But the Wildlife Trusts, which opposes the badger cull, believes it is cheaper than culling and highly effective. In 2014, 11 Wildlife Trusts delivered 317 doses of vaccine across 31.4km/sq of countryside at a cost of £293 per dose.

Volunteers receive government training to become qualified vaccinators, and 80 members of the public are assisting the Derbyshire programme. “We’re showing we can use a large number of enthusiastic volunteers and train them up and it’s way, way cheaper than shooting badgers,” said Birch. “The number of enthusiastic volunteers who will do anything to join the programme is really inspiring. If there were more resources available we could do a hell of a lot of vaccination over a much wider area.”

During the first two years of the badger cull, it cost £6,775 to cull each badger, including police costs, although this expense is understood to have fallen with the expansion of the cull to 10 areas in Devon, Somerset, Dorset, Gloucestershire and Herefordshire in 2016.

Unlike England, Wales has successfully reduced bovine TB in cattle without culling badgers. New herd incidents – a key measure of the disease’s spread – have fallen by 40% in Wales since 2009. The Welsh government’s success has been attributed to tighter movement controls, improved bio security, and better TB testing. But Wales is this year introducing a very targeted badger cull on 60 farms with a chronic TB problem. Badgers will be tested for the disease and culled if they are found to carry it.

Ministers must work faster to ensure that after Brexit UK and EU court judgments are mutually recognised and enforced, the lord chief justice has urged.

In his final speech at the annual Mansion House dinner for judges, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd blasted government delays in negotiating a settlement to protect Britain’s £25.7bn a year legal industry.

Addressing the white-tie event, the outgoing lord chief justice said: “It is essential for the UK that we work with the EU to ensure that there is a simple and flexible regime for the mutual recognition of enforcement of judgments for the future.

“Many months have elapsed since these points were made clear by the judiciary and the legal profession to Her Majesty’s Government. There is no reason for further delay.





“The common good and the national interest demand no less than the clearest commitment by Her Majesty’s Government on these issues. It is an essential support for the continued position and promotion of our laws, our courts, our judges, our arbitration centres and our legal profession and, of course, the major contribution they make to national prosperity, both in their own right and in the essential support of the financial services industry.”





The new justice secretary, David Lidington, was present at the dinner. Lord Thomas is due to retire in the coming months. His comments suggest there is considerable frustration over government failures to protect the UK’s position as an international legal centre. How the European court of justice in Luxembourg – the EU’s highest court – and the UK courts will deal with each other’s decisions is emerging as one of the key Brexit battlegrounds.







Remainers and soft Brexiters are urging ministers to ensure that there will be close cooperation, if not continued recognition of rulings to ensure businesses that trade with the EU are operating on equal terms. For Brexiters, however, it is a fundamental demand that the UK should be entirely free from the Luxembourg’s court jurisdiction.





Thomas also pointed out that last Thursday the EU published interim arrangements on applicable law, jurisdiction and enforcement of judgments. “It is not necessary for me to say how it is ... urgent and important to have certainty about these interim arrangements,” the lord chief justice added.

He is is the second senior judge in recent days to speak about the consequences of Brexit for the legal profession. Lord Neuberger, the outgoing president of the supreme court, gave a conference of visiting Australian lawyers a more upbeat assessment earlier this week.

He said: “We are determined that the United Kingdom’s forthcoming exit from the European Union will in no way undermine London’s status as the world centre for legal services generally and dispute resolution in particular.

“The common law, which is so attuned to the needs and realities of the commercial world, will remain as attuned to the demands of international business as it ever was. Indeed, left, once again, to our own common law devices, we will in some respects be able to react more quickly and freely to developments in our fast-changing world. Brexit does not alter the fact that lawyers and judges in the UK are as internationally minded and expert as they ever have been.”

PM will use summit meeting with US president to say climate change agreement doesn’t need renegotiation

Theresa May will raise the issue of climate change with Donald Trump this weekend when the pair meet for the first time since she lost her majority in the general election. They will talk at the G20 summit in Hamburg, which runs on Friday and Saturday.

The two leaders will hold a formal bilateral meeting, at which the prime minister plans to tell the US president she does not believe the Paris climate change agreement needs to be renegotiated.

Trump caused consternation worldwide last month when he confirmed that he wanted to withdraw from the pact.

May was criticised at the time for not signing a letter sent by several European governments condemning the move – though she insisted she had discussed it with him directly.

But a senior government official said the prime minister would be “stressing that the UK remains fully committed to the Paris agreement. She will say that we don’t see any need for renegotiation – we support the Paris agreement because it delivers.”

Hopes of mild climate change dashed by new research Read more

May and Trump are also expected to discuss this week’s North Korean missile test, with the prime minister stressing that it is essential the international community is united in condemnation of North Korea’s actions.

Barry Gardiner, Labour’s shadow cabinet minister dealing with climate change, called for a more robust approach on climate, saying the prime minister should “take President Trump to task” for his announcement that the US will quit the international accord to address dangerous global warming.

Gardiner said: “A Labour prime minister would make clear that the UK stands by the Paris agreement and that America is diminished by the president’s foolish and shortsighted decision to withdraw.”

May and Trump’s last face-to-face meeting was at the G7 in Sicily, in an unscheduled “pull aside” in which Downing street said they “reaffirmed their commitment to increasing trade between the UK and the US, including a post-Brexit trade deal”.



The prime minister was later criticised for failing to sign up to a joined up statement from the G7’s EU leaders – Germany’s Angela Merkel, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Italy’s Paolo Gentiloni – saying the Paris accord could not be renegotiated.

The trio said: “We deem the momentum generated in Paris in December 2015 irreversible and we firmly believe that the Paris agreement cannot be renegotiated, since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies.”

Downing Street stressed that the UK had responded in a normal way to the situation, and that the other G7 countries, Canada and Japan, had not signed up to the statement either.

Since May’s last meeting with Trump the US president caused anger in the UK by misquoting the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, following the London bridge terror attack last month.



Trump castigated Khan on Twitter, saying the mayor had said there was “no reason to be alarmed” by the attack. Khan had in fact said this about the increased and armed police presence in London after the attack.

Trump had been due to hold a state visit to the UK over the summer, which was set to be dogged by mass protests. However, this appears to have been indefinitely put back, with Trump reportedly telling May he did not want to make the trip if the British public did not support him.

While Downing Street has insisted the plans have not changed, Trump’s arrival was not mentioned in last month’s Queen’s speech, as is normal for state visits, indicating has not been fixed for the two-year period covered by the address.

Campaigners and shareholders criticise board for decision to replace ‘gold standard’ ethical label with its own ‘fairly traded’ product

Sainsbury’s has been accused of undermining the Fairtrade movement by experimenting with dropping the ethical mark for its own label tea.

A series of shareholders and campaign groups criticised the supermarket group for dropping Fairtrade at its annual meeting in London on Wednesday, in an increasingly fraught exchange with the company’s board. Outside the event, protesters carried placards expressing their concern at the development.

The protests follow Sainsbury’s recent pilot in which it no longer labels its own-brand teas as Fairtrade, badging them “fairly traded” instead. The company said it was running a pilot with its tea products – but those opposing the change fear it will be extended to other products, including bananas and coffee.

Anne Lindsay, a private-sector analyst from Cafod, the Catholic charity, said to the board: “I am concerned that after years of being an extremely valuable champion of Fairtrade, Sainsbury’s is starting in a direction that could undermine Fairtrade and lead to a plethora of different standards by different companies and confusion for consumers.”

Another shareholder said: “I have seen the publicity about the proposed change from Fairtrade to ‘fairly traded’ tea. I have come across the term fairly traded when I have shopped in budget chains. I don’t know what it means and I don’t think most people who shop in Sainsbury’s do either.”

She said information on how Sainsbury’s scheme would work was “sketchy” and that it was not clear who would decide how the premium paid for ethically traded goods would be distributed to farmers and communities.

Some other shareholders, who nearly missed out on asking questions as Sainsbury’s chairman David Tyler tried to bring the meeting to a close, accused the company of trying to stifle debate. At least one campaigner was not able to ask a question at all.

“Are you now reasserting the power of the retailer against that of the producer – taking back control – and putting developing world producers back in the subservient role that Fairtrade redeems them from?” said Douglas James, an independent shareholder.

He said recognition of the Fairtrade mark outshone that of any other ethical mark and was “the envy of the marketing world, the gold standard”. “What do you hope to achieve by giving up the moral high ground and the kudos you currently enjoy and going it alone as yet another self-defining brand?”

Mike Coupe, Sainsbury’s chief executive, defended the change at the AGM, saying the company was “trying to bring clarity to a very complicated environment”, which encompassed many different ethical standards and labels.

He said the changes being made on tea products were a pilot and Sainsbury’s was committed to a transparent review of how well it worked with the seven producer groups involved.

“We are committed to the standards Fairtrade currently apply but we have to move on to ensure we cover social, environmental and economically sustainable standards around the world.”

He said Sainsbury’s “didn’t want to mark its own homework” and would work with independent groups to verify its practices. But he suggested Fairtrade had become outdated.

“It might have been fit for purpose 25 years ago, but we’re in a new world with new technology,” he said.

When four Sainsbury’s executives met farmers from some of Africa’s biggest tea-growing co-operatives in a hotel in Nairobi last month it should have been a mutual celebration of Fairtrade, the gold standard of ethical trading and the world’s most trusted and best-known food certification scheme.

But instead of backslapping at the Pride hotel, the world’s largest retailer of Fairtrade products precipitated the greatest crisis in the scheme’s 25-year history by telling the 13 major tea groups and their 228,000 co-operative members that it intended to drop the globally known Fairtrade mark for their produce, and replace it with the phrase “fairly traded”.

In place of the strict rules devised by farmers’ groups working with independent development experts to guarantee consumers that small-scale farmers are being rewarded with decent pay and bonuses, the £23bn-a-year retailer said it planned to set up its own in-house certification scheme, set new ethical standards and introduce a different way to pay the groups.

From next week the company will no longer label its Gold, Red and other bestselling own-brand teas as “Fairtrade” but will call them “fairly traded”. Officially it is a pilot but the suspicion is that Sainsbury’s will then roll out the new standard across other products including bananas and coffee.

To add to the woes of the Fairtrade brand, it was revealed last week that Tesco will move all its own-label coffee from Fairtrade to another ethical certification scheme, the Rainforest Alliance. According to the Grocer, an industry magazine, this is likely to happen in 2018 and follows a similar announcement by the retailer earlier this year that it will do the same with its own-brand tea.

The farmers at the meeting with Sainsbury’s, mostly from Malawi, Rwanda and Kenya, were nonplussed. “Why change a system that has worked well for 25 years for both poor farmers and large supermarkets?” asked one. Had not the supermarket reaped tens of millions of pounds’ profit and huge moral kudos by pioneering Fairtrade and inviting customers to pay a bit more for their produce?

And in return for meeting Fairtrade’s high social, labour and environmental standards, the small farmers have also benefited to the tune of millions of pounds from the British consumer’s sense of fair play. “Has not everyone gained?” the tea farmers asked.

But the Nairobi meeting was significant because Sainsbury’s is just one of many large food and drink companies rethinking their supply chains, looking to cut costs and devising their own environmental and labour policies.

Because Sainsbury’s is so important for Fairtrade, the company’s move could be the beginning of the end of the scheme, and lead to lower social and labour standards, more hardship in developing countries and deep confusion among consumers, say some development and ethical trading groups.

“This move by Sainsbury’s represents a tip in the balance back to the powerful retailers,” says Sophi Tranchell, managing director of Divine Chocolate, the highly successful ethical trading company part-owned by tens of thousands of cocoa farmers in Ghana.

Fairtrade took off as an idea in the 1980s as awareness grew in Europe that small farmers in developing countries were being ripped off by a grossly unfair global commodity trading system which perpetuated poverty and penalised the poorest. In 1992, a group of Britain’s leading international charities, including Oxfam and the World Development Movement, picked up on a small Dutch initiative and set up the Fairtrade Foundation.

Twenty-five years later, the certification scheme, which guarantees a minimum price to farmers as well as a financial bonus, has grown from the commercial margins to the retail mainstream. Fairtrade, worldwide, is now a $2bn-a-year global operation, backed by governments, charities, churches, the Women’s Institute, A-list celebrities and supermarkets. In Britain, where it is most popular, nearly 80% of people are said to recognise its distinctive logo.

It has been an unlikely commercial success story, and a ray of optimism for millions of people concerned about inequalities between rich and poor countries and deteriorating human and labour rights.

“Fairtrade is growing worldwide, especially in south-east Asia and eastern Europe. It now benefits 1.6 million farmers worldwide, has 1,240 Fairtrade-certified producer organisations in 75 countries and last year a record £150m was sent as social premium payments to producer groups,” says Darío Soto Abril, the Colombian chief executive of the International Fairtrade organisation.

“The need to change a global food system that exploits both people and planet is greater now than ever,” says Abril. “There are new challenges. Climate change is making life harder for smallholder farmers, there is child exploitation, and many workers in developing countries are paid well below even the extreme poverty level. Fairtrade is changing to take these new challenges into account.”

Meanwhile, ethical trading that covers non-food items from clothing to crafts has grown steadily in Europe and the US and is now thought to be worth billions more pounds a year. Following boycotts of companies by activists and public pressure a variety of certification schemes have sprung up, which retailers are invited to join, for a price.

For a while the corporates were happy to pay and have their supply chains independently audited, but in recent years some of the biggest have decided to go it alone. High street chains including Costa, Starbucks and McDonald’s, and producers such as Unilever, M&S and Mondelez/Cadbury, have all devised their own schemes. But their standards vary enormously and consumers have to trust the companies.

The fractious Nairobi meeting made clear the despair felt by small farmers at the global trading system, in which supermarkets and shippers make big profits from importing raw produce from developing countries but barely anything goes to the farmers. It also showed how valuable a good ethical trading scheme can be for small farmers.

According to people at the meeting, the more the Sainsbury’s chiefs promised them contracts, advice and access to data, and told them the new in-house scheme would match their present income, the more worried they became.

Their fears centred on the “social premium”, the money that Fairtrade provides to farmers on top of the guaranteed minimum price they get for their produce. This money, which can be worth many thousands of pounds a year to big producer groups, goes straight to the farmers who agree to spend it on social schemes such as pensions, sick pay or education which they themselves choose and control.

The premium money, it emerged at the meeting, was in future going to have to be approved by a new Sainsbury’s foundation. “We feel betrayed. We are expected to cross our fingers and hope that Mr Sainsbury helps us. The power to give you money or not depends on them. It is good if they are planning to really help us but not at the cost of disempowering us,” said one man, who asked not to be named and who represents thousands of tea farmers. “We feel that our rights are being taken away from us, this feels like colonialism,” said a second at the meeting. “We want to be partners and friends. You want to control me. I don’t understand how a big retailer is chasing the premium going to poor people,” said a third.

Sainsbury’s apologised for giving the tea-growers such short notice of the changes it planned. But it has refused to consult further, and it is now feared that bananas, sugar, chocolate and dozens of other Fairtrade lines sold in the company’s 2,100 stores will eventually be withdrawn from Fairtrade as the company rolls out its own ethical trading scheme.

Last week Sainsbury’s senior executives insisted the new scheme was a pilot that would build on Fairtrade standards. “By providing farmers with advice, skills, resources, funding and opportunities alongside accountability, as well as listening and learning from them, we believe we can help empower them to secure a better quality life for themselves, their workers, families and broader communities,” said Judith Batchelar, director of brand at Sainsbury’s.

Companies setting up their own ethical trading schemes all say they want to improve workers’ conditions and pay. Some, such as Mondelez/Cadbury which pulled out of the Fairtrade scheme last year, have promised to invest over $400m in their cocoa supply chain, but it has been suggested that others are choosing cut-price schemes which do not guarantee better terms or more money.

Development groups question their motives. “Why would a company like Sainsbury’s that has been such a massive champion of Fairtrade decide to take the trusted mark off their tea products, and in the process take power and value away from small African producers who already have so little? At a time when sustainable development and human rights are going up the corporate agenda, it’s hard to follow the company’s reasoning,” said Rachel Wilshaw, Oxfam’s ethical trade manager.

Consumers, too, are confused. “How are we meant to know if these companies can be trusted? I only know the Fairtrade mark,” said Gillian Hargreaves, a shopper at a Sainsbury’s store in Oswestry, Shropshire, last week.

Sainsbury’s insists that its new approach will benefit farmers. But it now faces consumer boycotts and is under heavy fire from African tea producers and international development and trading groups.

A statement signed by Oxfam, Cafod, Christian Aid, the Women’s Institute and several major ethical trading and co-operative groups together representing millions of consumers, urged it to rethink its plans.

“The Fairtrade mark has become synonymous with ethical trade and quality for UK consumers. Sainsbury’s new scheme risks undermining all that has been achieved over the last 25 years. The standards are unclear, and farmers and producers may no longer be able to decide themselves directly how the money raised is spent to help their communities,” said the groups.

“The fear is that if Sainsbury’s launch their own ‘ethical’ line instead of using the Fairtrade model, other supermarkets might follow suit and consider ditching Fairtrade too,” said Oxfam.

But conversations with the farmers and Sainsbury’s suggest it has been planning to pull out of Fairtrade for two years – not only to improve farmers’ conditions, but also for financial reasons. Sales of Fairtrade products are said to be slipping and the company feels it is not getting value for the £60m which it says it has “invested” in ethical trading since 1994.

Although it sells nearly £200m of Fairtrade produce a year, overall company profits dropped 8% last year and in a fierce retail environment it now wants more credit for investing in poor farmers. It also suggests that it wants its money to be seen by the public to be better spent.

Sainsbury’s chief executive Mike Coupe is now on the defensive. “We most certainly don’t pretend to have all the answers – far from it – and that’s why this project is about testing and developing new approaches, collaborating with expert partners and listening to our farmers and producers – finding out what works, and what can be taken to scale and adopted to secure a sustainable supply chain that benefits both our suppliers and our customers,” he said.

“The principle of a company setting its own standards is fine, but the execution here is flawed,” said Mike Gidney, chief executive of the Fairtrade Foundation in London. The group is funded by the licences it issues to companies and stands to lose tens of thousands of pounds a year from Sainsbury’s withdrawal from tea – and far more if the retailer drops all its other lines.

“We have always been supportive of companies who want to set up in-house schemes and create their own standards. Mondelez are adding to what we have done, putting $400m into cocoa. Others, like Sainsbury’s, are substituting their own schemes and risk reversing the gains. Some independent schemes are good, but others are not.

“Sainsbury’s call it a pilot scheme, but it’s over no defined period. Where is the detail? Who will administer it? Does it have enough staff? This is unacceptable and we must draw a line. The suspicion must be that they are trying to save costs. The question is why have they changed for what may be an inferior scheme?”

Fairtrade is in real danger but it has come under fierce attack many times. Free-market thinktanks including the Institute of Economic Affairs, claim it is a barrier to free trade, which they say has led to many millions of people emerging from poverty. Academics have shown that it sometimes fails to improve the lives of very low-wage workers, and journalists have exposed how some companies and producer groups can abuse it.

But its biggest test is likely to be Brexit and the many new “free trade” deals which Britain, the US and others are expected to sign. New taxes on imports from the world’s poorest countries could cost small producers billions of dollars.

“Too often in the past, new trade deals have harmed not helped the poorest people. Leaving the EU’s single market and customs area without putting in place measures similar to the ones which currently protect farmers in the poorest developing countries would punish millions of farmers,” said Gidney.

He wants to keep talking with Sainsbury’s. “We are open to change. We want companies to own their supply chains and take responsibility for the social and environmental impacts they are having. There is no single route to a better trading system. We will survive this. We have to work together.”

The Care Quality Commission has underlined the inadequate quality of care in examples of English care and nursing homes that failed their inspections

The Care Quality Commission, the NHS and care regulator in England, highlighted several examples of care and nursing homes where its inspectors found particularly poor care. It rated them all as providing “inadequate” care.

Highcroft Manor in Northamptonshire

A two-day unannounced inspection by inspectors in March led to the watchdog placing the home, which mainly looked after older people who had dementia, in special measures.

They found a “systematic failure in all areas of assessment and monitoring of people’s care, resulting in risks to people’s health and wellbeing”.

Safety alert as watchdog warns that one in three nursing homes is failing Read more

Residents were monitored too little given their health needs, and nurses did not always act promptly when a resident developed abnormal clinical symptoms. Staff did not give people their medication on time, manage their wounds properly or always help them eat and drink.

“People were at risk of infections as the home was not clean. People’s rooms, bedding and flooring were visibly dirty,” the CQC found.

“Staff were not always kind. People did not always have the ability to call for assistance and staff had little time to talk or support people with activities or socialising. Care ... did not always respect their dignity.”

The home’s owners have been given six months to instigate major improvements or risk having their registration with the CQC cancelled.

Crawfords Walk in Chester

In June the CQC was scathing in its criticism of Bupa, which runs the Crawfords Walk nursing home, after a Channel 4 Dispatches documentary exposed series of failings at the facility.

Andrea Sutcliffe, the CQC chief inspector of adult social care, was appalled at “shocking evidence” of understaffing, bad practice and poor care.

“The examples of poor care and a culture of inappropriate, institutionalised practice highlightd by this programme are wholly unacceptable,” she said.

“Bupa has betrayed the very people it is paid to look after.”

Inspectors found that people were forced to wait to go to the toilet and that as a result some had soiled themselves. Some residents had still not had their breakfast by 11am.

Staff got some residents out of bed to be washed and changed as early as 5.15am, so that it was “easier” for staff to look after them. Some were then put back to bed. One nurse told Dispatches how she had to get people up at 3.30am to give them bed baths.

Incontinence pads were rationed in the home and some soiled ones reused. A care assistant was filmed shouting at a resident who had filled her incontinence pad, telling her that “you’re full of crap again” and “you’re so naughty”.

Meadowbrook Care Home in Shropshire

Inspectors found ants crawling over one of its dining tables and a soiled mattress.

They observed staff not helping a resident who was struggling to eat, even though food was spilling into their lap.

One resident told inspectors that they sometimes had to wait for an hour before staff responded to their calls for help.

Aamina Homecare in Lincolnshire

The CQC rated it as “inadequate” in April, though a previous inspection in April 2015 had found it to be “good”.

Residents assessed as needing 30 or 45 minutes of support received help for as little as six minutes.

Staff administered medicines unsafely and at the wrong times. One person who should have had drugs every four hours instead received them all at once.

One person had 19 different carers in a month, which exposed them to neglect. Another resident who needed two staff to support them from bed with personal care and getting dressed went without any help at all for two days.

An unemployed man is facing a life sentence after being convicted of killing two of his former girlfriends five years apart following a long-running campaign for justice by one of his victim’s family.

Robert Trigg, 52, was convicted on Wednesday of murdering Susan Nicholson in 2011 as she slept on a sofa next to him. Nicholson’s death came five years after he killed another partner, 35-year-old Caroline Devlin, in her bed.



He had subjected both women to physical abuse during their relationships, and after one outburst, Devlin told a friend: “I won’t be here for my 40th.”

Despite Trigg’s history of violence, neither of the deaths in Worthing, West Sussex, were thought to be suspicious at the time. Trigg claimed he inadvertently rolled on to Nicholson in his sleep, suffocating her, while Devlin’s death was recorded as caused by an aneurysm.

Trigg failed to call 999 in either case.

Devlin’s naked body was found by one of her four children on Mother’s Day when she came in to ask what she would like for her special breakfast.

Trigg was only brought to justice because of the refusal by Nicholson’s family to accept a coroner’s ruling that she died accidentally. When the cases were reviewed by consultant pathologist Dr Nathaniel Cary, he concluded Nicholson, 52, was suffocated by having her head forced into the sofa, while Devlin had suffered a blow to the back of the head.

He denied any wrongdoing but was convicted of Nicholson’s murder and Devlin’s manslaughterafter six-and-a-half hours of deliberation by jurors following a 10-day trial at Lewes crown court.

At the trial, Trigg was described as being “possessive, controlling and jealous”. One former girlfriend described him as a Jekyll and Hyde character who drank heavily. After Nicholson died, Trigg went out to buy cigarettes instead of calling the emergency services, and called his brother before phoning a neighbour, Hannah Cooper. He told her: “It’s Sue, I think she’s dead.”

Cooper said Nicholson and Trigg had a volatile and violent relationship, with rows fuelled by alcohol. Police had been called at least six times following disputes between them, said Cooper.

Bridget Benger, a close friend of Devlin, told how her personality changed after she started a relationship with Trigg, describing her becoming withdrawn and having “lost her spark”. Three weeks before her death, Benger made a pact with Devlin promising that if anything happened to them, they would support each other’s children.



Benger told how she found out about the discovery of her friend’s body from Devlin’s eldest son who knocked on her door, telling her: “We can’t wake mummy.”

On the night Devlin died, one of her children heard the sounds of “rough and loud” sexual intercourse coming from her bedroom. In the morning she was found naked on the bed with her face buried in the duvet.

No one attempted emergency CPR and Devlin was already dead when medics arrived. The trial heard that a number of police officers who attended the scene believed that her death was not suspicious.

Nigel Pilkington, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “This was an extremely unusual case and required us to put together a compelling case in the face of initial pathology results that suggested the victims had died of natural causes.

“With the benefit of knowing the wider picture, this allowed the pathologist to now consider what else could have happened on those fateful nights, with the results telling a very different story,” Pilkington said.

He added: “In the face of this, it was extremely unlikely that two of Trigg’s partners had died of natural causes while sharing a bed with him, and today he has been brought to justice for both deaths.”



Trigg is scheduled to be sentenced on Thursday morning.

Social media users react with glee and disbelief as Tory MP reveals name of newborn son on Instagram

The Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg has provoked delight and mirth by naming his newborn son and sixth child Sixtus.

Rees-Mogg, MP for North East Somerset, announced the birth on Instagram on Wednesday.

He posted an image of himself cradling Sixtus, with the words: “Helena and I announce with great joy that we have a baby Sixtus Dominic Boniface Christopher, a brother for Peter, Mary, Thomas, Anselm and Alfred.”

One Twitter user responded: “There’s a man in touch with the challenges of modern life.”

Another said: “The thing about Jacob Rees-Mogg is that his politics [are] horrendous but I can’t bring myself to hate him because he’s from another time.”

And another wrote: “Jacob Rees-Mogg is trending because apparently we’ve had no recent lessons about not taking dangerously inept rich men in politics seriously.”

Sixtus isn’t the only one of the Rees-Mogg brood with a lengthy name. His siblings’ full names are Peter Theodore Alphege, Mary Anne Charlotte Emma, Thomas Wentworth Somerset Dunstan, Anselm Charles Fitzwilliam and Alfred Wulfric Leyson Pius Rees-Mogg.

The Old Etonian’s eccentric image has made him something of a cult figure on Instagram and Twitter. Rees-Mogg is a recent convert to social media, describing it in a recent interview as “great fun”. His Twitter background features a bucolic Somerset landscape.

The sketch writer Quentin Letts famously dubbed him “the honourable member for the early 20th century”. Rees-Mogg himself, a member of an old mining family, has said he is suspicious of politicians who try to present themselves as “men of the people”.

Move means Home Office will not conduct checks on residents or those coming forward to help authorities in fire inquiry

The Home Office has announced a temporary 12-month immigration “amnesty” for survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire.

The immigration minister, Brandon Lewis, told MPs the move was in recognition of the fact that some foreign nationals directly affected by the fire did not wish to engage with the authorities because of their concerns about their unresolved immigration status or because their permission to stay in Britain was about to expire.

The announcement means the Home Office will not conduct checks on residents of Grenfell Tower and Grenfell Walk or those coming forward to provide information to help the authorities in their inquiries.

The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, welcomed the announcement but said the 12-month amnesty did not go far enough.



Taskforce to take over key council services in Kensington and Chelsea Read more

“I’m pleased to see the government has met the request I raised in the Commons on Monday for an immigration amnesty for Grenfell survivors. Without an immigration amnesty there may well be people we never know about, and too many people who need help who will not receive it,” she said.



“But this does not go far enough to ensure the confidence of those affected. Why would they volunteer their details knowing that in just 12 months they could face deportation? The amnesty must be indefinite to be truly effective.”



Survivors who contact the Home Office will be given up to a year’s temporary leave to remain in Britain outside the immigration rules and with full access to relevant support and assistance. The usual requirement that they demonstrate that they can live without claiming social security benefits or having recourse to other public funds will also be waived. No fees will be charged either.

It is understood that the Home Office has offered the temporary leave to remain status in good faith and does not intend to use it to take subsequent enforcement action when it expires and may actually offer those involved the opportunity to regularise their status in Britain.

The policy will be kept under review and remain in place at least until 31 August.



The immigration minister said: “This period of leave to remain for those directly affected by the fire will provide survivors with the time to deal with the extremely difficult circumstances in which they find themselves and start to rebuild their lives while considering their future options, as well as to assist the police and other authorities with their inquiries about the fire.”

Abbott pressed the case for an immigration amnesty for Grenfell survivors in the Commons on Monday. She said concern about their immigration status was one of the factors preventing people from coming forward, either to obtain the help they need or to provide the information the authorities need.

Response follows reports 700 people hired as litter pickers were sacked after two days at event attended by the Labour leader

Labour has condemned the use of zero-hours contracts for workers at Glastonbury festival, where Jeremy Corbyn made a high-profile appearance last month.

Reports claim hundreds of workers were hired from other EU countries to work as litter pickers – with many finding themselves unexpectedly dismissed after just two days’ work.

Asked about the allegations, Corbyn’s spokesman said: “Jeremy and the Labour party have taken a very strong stand against the use of zero-hours contracts, and the exploitation of migrant and other workers, and the spread of all manner of insecure agency working, and we would take that view wherever it happened.

“That goes not just for zero-hour contracts but other forms of exploitation – bogus self-employment, fake agency working and so on.”

Corbyn appeared on the festival’s Pyramid stage, where the crowd of tens of thousands repeatedly chanted: “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn,” weeks after depriving Theresa May of her majority at the general election.

He told the audience: “The commentariat got it wrong, the elite got it wrong. Politics is about the lives of all of us. The wonderful campaign I was a part of and led brought people back to politics because they believed there was something on offer for them.”



His spokesman said: “There has been an explosion of insecure employment and zero-hours contracts, and we are opposed to that, and in our manifesto we made clear that a Labour government will legislate across the board to reform the labour market and ensure that there’s a floor under conditions at work that have been savagely undermined.”

He stressed that a Labour government would outlaw the kinds of practices claimed to have been used at the festival. The Independent reported that up to 700 people were hired as litter pickers only to be told at the last minute they were not needed. The festival organisers have not yet responded to the claims.

Asked whether Corbyn would raise the issue with Glastonbury’s founder, Michael Eavis, if he attends the next festival, the spokesman said: “I think he’s happy to raise it right now.”



And to the question of whether festivalgoers should pay more for their tickets to allow workers to be better remunerated, Corbyn’s spokesman said: “How Glastonbury runs its event and how it manages its finances is entirely a matter for them, but in terms of employment contracts, those contracts should not be taking place, they should not be used – we’re opposed to them.”

In a statement, Glastonbury festival said: “In response to recent stories in the media, we would like to state that Glastonbury festival’s post-event litter picking team are all given temporary worker agreements for the duration of the clean-up.

“As well as being paid, they are provided with free meals and access to on-site facilities. The length of the clean-up varies considerably from year to year, based largely upon the weather conditions before, during and after the festival.

“This is something the litter pickers - many of whom return year after year - are made aware of in their worker agreements (which assure them of a minimum of eight hours’ work).

“This year was an unusually dry one for Glastonbury. That, coupled with a fantastic effort from festival goers in taking their belongings home, meant that the bulk of the litter picking work was completed after 2.5 days (in 2016, a very wet year, the equivalent period was around 10 days).

“All but a core crew of litter pickers were advised that there was no further work available after Friday (June 30). Those who weren’t able to leave the site over the weekend were given further meals, plus assistance with travel to nearby towns with public transport links.



“We’d like to thank the litter pickers for their work on the clean-up, which was - as always - hugely valued by the festival.”

British film-making will suffer if Brexit puts obstacles in the way of European nationals working in UK, says director

Award-winning film director Ken Loach has said that Brexit will “throw a spanner in the works” of the British film industry.

The I, Daniel Blake director said any bureaucracy created by the end of freedom of movement between the UK and the European Union will stall co-productions with EU nations.

“If free movement stops and it becomes a big bureaucratic process for people to work in Britain, then that is going to inhibit [co-productions] because it is cumbersome,” he told the Hollywood Reporter.

“Free movement enables Belgians to come, so if free movement stops, that will throw a spanner in the works.”

The two-time winner of the Palme d’Or at Cannes said the European Film Academy could play a role in negotiating film workers’ movement rights, according to the US magazine which spoke to him at the Karlovy Vary film festival in the Czech Republic.

I, Daniel Blake, which won him one of those awards, was a joint production between companies in the UK, France and Belgium.

The 81-year-old supporter of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn – he produced a party election broadcast for him – has long used his films to fight for social causes. His 1966 film about homelessness, Cathy Come Home, led to the creation of the Crisis charity.

A report commissioned by the British Film Institute in 2016 found that Brexit could boost film industry jobs in the UK or slash them, depending on the type of deal struck.

More than 14,000 jobs could be shed if no deal is negotiated, leaving Britain and the union operating under World Trade Organisation rules, the report said. But if a Swiss-style arrangement was struck where the freedom of movement still exists, then 5,000 jobs could be added, it found.

The latter scenario would seem unlikely, with both Labour and the Tories saying an end to the freedom of movement is necessary.

The idea of a ‘big marriage’ to tackle issues such as North Korea is dead and what might come from their G20 meeting is unknown, but it will be tense

“Occasionally, yes, toughness does involve some old-fashioned ass-kicking,” Donald Trump mused in “Surviving at the Top”.



In his dealings with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, though, the US president has until recently preferred to kiss.

“He is a very good man ... he loves China and he loves the people of China,” Trump fawned after their first date in April at his Mar-a-Lago estate.



In another interview he boasted: “I really liked him a lot. I think he liked me. We have a great chemistry together.”



But as the pair prepare for their second tête-à-tête on the sidelines of the G20 in Hamburg this week, the passion appears to be fading. “So much for China working with us – but we had to give it a try!” Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning before setting off for Europe on Air Force One.

Experts warn that, after a brief and unusual honeymoon, relations between the world’s top two economies are veering towards the rocks after Xi and Trump failed to find common ground over how to rein in North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.



Kim’s test of an intercontinental ballistic missile aimed at the “American bastards” this week did nothing to improve the atmosphere between Washington and Beijing.

Björn Conrad, the vice president of Berlin’s Mercator Institute for China Studies, said that on reaching the White House Trump had shelved campaign promises to confront Beijing over what he termed its “rapacious” trade practices. He did so in the hope Xi would help him thwart Pyongyang’s nuclear ambitions.

Beijing, however, had been unwilling to forge such an alliance, meaning the risk of a full-blown US-China trade conflict was now back. “Now the focus of the Trump administration shifts once more – and China is back in the cross-hairs,” Conrad said.



Zhu Feng, the director of Nanjing University’s institute of international studies, agreed ties were entering “a new phase of uncertainty”: “The future of US-China relations is worrying.”



Trump’s shock election fuelled fears of a clash between the world’s top two economies. On the stump and in print, Trump had spent years denigrating Beijing, particularly over the damage he alleged it had inflicted on the US economy.

“There are people who wish I wouldn’t refer to China as our enemy. But that’s exactly what they are,” he wrote in his campaign manifesto, Great Again. When one of Trump’s first post-election acts was to thumb his nose at Beijing by fielding a call from Taiwan’s president those fears intensified.



Chinese New Year, however, appeared to herald a new dawn. In February, Ivanka Trump made a peacemaking visit to the Chinese embassy in Washington. Her husband, Jared Kushner, emerged as a key intermediary between his billionaire father-in-law and China’s top leadership. Two months later, Xi and Trump finally met at Mar-a-Lago, and the US president’s rhetoric pivoted immediately from insults to unbridled affection. “I think in the long term were going to have a very, very great relationship,” Trump gushed, heaping praise on Xi and his “incredibly talented wife”.



In recent weeks, however, the tone has soured, amid signs Trump is losing faith in Xi’s willingness to act on North Korea. In late June he vented his frustrations on Twitter: “While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried.”



Then he bared his teeth. Last week Washington unveiled sanctions against a Chinese bank linked to North Korea, announced a major arms sale to Taiwan and sailed a warship close to a disputed island in the South China Sea - moves experts described as unmistakable snubs designed to convey US dissatisfaction with Xi’s regime.

During a phone call on Monday, Xi warned his US counterpart of “negative factors” that were creeping into what Trump had termed their “great relationship”.



Asked if the Xi-Trump bromance was really over, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry replied tetchily: “The ‘honeymoon period’ between China and the United States ... is an interpretation of the media. Officials from both the United States and China ... have not employed this expression.”

Orville Schell, the director of the Centre on US-China Relations at New York’s Asia Society, said Trump’s effusive courtship of Xi had been part of a genuine bid to propose “a big marriage” that would have seen the two powers confront North Korea together.



But the US president considered China’s response to his advances – which included halting imports of North Korean coal – inadequate, “so now Trump is starting to drift away and to turn up the heat”.

“I think Xi has missed a great opportunity, actually,” Schell said. “Had he buddied up with Trump and put the screws on North Korea I think he would have gained immensely in other realms like trade, the South China Sea, the East China Sea. But it seems he is not willing or able to really declare himself married to the US and Trump on the question of North Korea.”

Conrad said Trump had hoped that by teaming up with Beijing on North Korea he could achieve “a quick and very visible foreign policy win”. “And then it turns out - as it always does - that reality is just much more complicated than that.”

“I wouldn’t say it was a mistake [for Xi] not to take that offer in exchange for peace on the trade front,” he added. “I don’t think there was real space [for a deal].”

On the eve of their G20 meeting, Trump has hinted his proposal to the Communist party chief still stands. “Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!” he tweeted on Tuesday after Pyongyang’s latest missile test.



Schell predicted Trump would make one final pass at China’s leader in Hamburg: “I think this is the last flight out for Xi.” But it was an offer Xi was likely to decline. “They are such a deeply conservative regime that they have a very difficult time imagining real paradigm shifts and really perceiving how the world has changed and where new convergences of common interests actually lie, à la Kissinger.”

Conrad said the question now was how destructive the fall-out would be. “There will be tensions over trade with China - this is almost certain. But there are still different ways for this to play out,” he said.



Conrad said the best case scenario was a “subtle” trade dispute that stayed within the realms of World Trade Organisation rules. The worst: provocative and blatantly protectionist steps from Trump that thrust both sides into “full-blown trade war mode”.



After months of simpering, “some old-fashioned ass-kicking” may be back on the cards.

The Taj Mahal of Debt : TRUMP Surviving at the Top by Donald J. Trump with Charles Leerhsen (Random House: $21.95; 236 pp., illustrated ; 0-394-57597-0)

Have you seen the cover? There's the celestial Trump, floating in the clouds like a Tiepolo angel and flipping an apple into the air. The apple is supposed to represent New York, so you get the idea that Trump has New York in the palm of his hand, and the expression on his face says: "I've made it, you schmucks, and too bad about you."

The title alone, "Surviving at the Top," is so perversely marvelous that there ought to be a contest to invent others that could equal it. Here are a few candidates: Marie Antoinette's "Keeping My Head," Achilles' "Recovering From a Hamstring Injury," Gen. Custer's "Outfoxing the Enemy" and Jean Claude Duvalier's "President for Life."

But, alas, he did write another book, "Trump: Surviving at the Top," which is another kind of great deal, ranking right up there with "Vanna Speaks." It came out in New York the very week that Trump's lenders in New Jersey were working overtime to stave off the imminent bankruptcy of the great "survivor of success" himself, now saddled with the Taj Majal of Debt.

Why couldn't Donald Trump quit while he was ahead? He already owned Trump's Castle, Trump Tower, Trump Plaza and Trump Parc, and all of them "great deals," so what did he need with the disastrous Taj Mahal of Debt? Why build another casino?

Compare this celestial Trump on the cover of the new book to the one on the cover of the first book--"Trump: The Art of the Deal"--where the man appears to be sitting in a window, slightly elevated but within sight of the ground--and you realize how far Trump has risen in his own estimation, even in the short space of three years.

Compare the text of the new book to that of the old (there's a different ghostwriter this time) and you'll notice an obvious increase in the employment of flattering adjectives, such as: "dazzling trophy" (Trump's yacht), "fabulous structure" (his Plaza hotel), "marvelous facility" (a Trump casino), "jewel-encrusted casino" (another Trump plaything), "the magnificent Taj Mahal" (the Trump Taj Mahal), the "best airline of its kind" (the Trump shuttle), "adoring crowds," "huge talent" and "celebrity-studded events."

Under the circumstances, the Trump books have a definite new appeal in the humor category, which is how I would market them if I were Random House or Warner, right alongside Dave Barry. Throughout, there are funny quotes, such as: "Bankers now come to me to ask if I might be interested in borrowing their money. They know a safe bet"; or "I'm going to be building when everybody else has gone bust"; or Trump's advice to Mike Tyson: "Stay out of investments in real- estate deals and tax shelters."

Another rewarding way to read Trump is to study both volumes simultaneously. This, I found, gives many clues as to what has happened to Trump to drive him toward insolvency.

In Trump's initial memoir from three years ago, he was nearly all business: haggling, niggling, finding the good deals that would make him rich. In the photo section of the first book, there are two pages of Trump appearing with various "hot people," such as Herschel Walker and the Reagans, but seven pages of Trump's marvelous buildings. This more or less indicates where Trump's priorities lay: seven-to-two, assets over celebrities.

In "Surviving at the Top," photos of Trump buildings have been reduced to three pages, while there are 10 pages of him standing with Hulk Hogan, the Muppets, Michael Jackson, Don Johnson, George Bush, Sugar Ray Leonard, Benazir Bhutto, Mike Wallace and Mike Tyson, whom Trump describes as "more than just a great boxer . . . one of the most talked-about people in the world. "

Judging by the photo ratio, you begin to suspect that keeping up with investments has not been as interesting to Trump as keeping up with talked-about people, which seems to have become the man's real full-time job.

Should Trump personally welcome Kitty Dukakis to the Plaza Hotel? Should he retaliate against a major designer, whom he once helped with a substance-abuse problem and who has snubbed Trump's latest fashion show? Should he lend his helicopter to the Duchess of York? Should he refuse to shake Mick Jagger's hand after Jagger has hogged a press conference at one of Trump's casinos? Should he let Time magazine put him on the cover? Should he tolerate Frank Sinatra's boorish behavior at a nightclub?

Planet could heat up far more than hoped as new work shows temperature rises measured over recent decades don’t fully reflect global warming already in the pipeline

Hopes that the world’s huge carbon emissions might not drive temperatures up to dangerous levels have been dashed by new research.

The work shows that temperature rises measured over recent decades do not fully reflect the global warming already in the pipeline and that the ultimate heating of the planet could be even worse than feared.



How much global temperatures rise for a certain level of carbon emissions is called climate sensitivity and is seen as the single most important measure of climate change. Computer models have long indicated a high level of sensitivity, up to 4.5C for a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere.

However in recent years estimates of climate sensitivity based on historical temperature records from the past century or so have suggested the response might be no more than 3C. This would mean the planet could be kept safe with lower cuts in emissions, which are easier to achieve.

But the new work, using both models and paleoclimate data from warming periods in the Earth’s past, shows that the historical temperature measurements do not reveal the slow heating of the planet’s oceans that takes place for decades or centuries after CO2 has been added to the atmosphere.

“The hope was that climate sensitivity was lower and the Earth is not going to warm as much,” said Cristian Proistosescu, at Harvard University in the US, who led the new research. “There was this wave of optimism.”

The new research, published in the journal Science Advances, has ended that. “The worrisome part is that all the models show there is an amplification of the amount of warming in the future,” he said. The situation might be even worse, as Proistosescu’s work shows climate sensitivity could be as high as 6C.

Prof Bill Collins, at the University of Reading, UK, and not part of the new research, said: “Some have suggested that we might be lucky and avoid dangerous climate change without taking determined action if the climate is not very sensitive to CO2 emissions. This work provides new evidence that that chance is remote.” He said greater long term warming had implications for melting of the world’s ice sheets and the rise of sea levels that already threatens many coastal cities.

Bad news for climate contrarians – 'the best data we have' just got hotter | John Abraham Read more

The reason the historical temperature measurements indicated a lower climate sensitivity than models or paleoclimate data is because the Earth has a fast and a slow response to increases in carbon emissions, Proistosescu said.

Land, mostly in the northern hemisphere heats up quickly. But there is also a slow response, he said: “This is mostly associated with warming over the oceans. They are big and full of cold water, especially at depth, and take a long time to heat up.” Furthermore, when the slow warming does kick in, it is likely to reduce the cloud cover that shades the Southern ocean and the eastern tropical Pacific, amplifying the heating.

The new research shows the 4.5C upper limit for climate sensitivity is real and means projections for global temperature rises cannot be reduced. The global temperature is likely to be 2.6C to 4.8C higher by the end of the century if emissions are not cut, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or 0.3C to 1.7C if sharp emissions cuts begin in the next few years.

The world may already be seeing the increasing rises in temperature, said Prof Piers Forster at the University of Leeds, UK: “It may already be happening – the rapid increase in temperatures since 2014 could be partly due to the eastern Pacific catching up.”

Reconciling all the estimates of climate sensitivity has also shown that climate models are not flawed. “Historical observations give us a lot of insight into how climate changes and are an important test of our climate models,” said Prof Peter Huybers, a colleague of Proistosescu’s at Harvard University. “But there is no perfect analogue for the changes that are coming.”

Diplomats plan for the fall of Isis, as Kurdish and Arab fighters continue to push forward into the terror group’s Syrian stronghold

US-backed forces encircling Raqqa expect the fight to oust the remnants of Islamic State from its most symbolic Syrian stronghold to take at least three months, despite rapid advances towards the city centre this week.



The advance met with fierce resistance on Wednesday, as Isis fighters used an eighth-century fortified wall as a buffer against Kurdish and Arab fighters known as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), who had been claiming neighbourhoods of the city, while steadily closing in from its surrounds.

With the wall now breached, and Raqqa all but encircled, the fate of at least 60,000 residents trapped inside is growing increasingly desperate. A volunteer fighter with Kurdish troops said as many as 50 airstrikes were hitting Raqqa each day, and observers suggested that as many as half of the reported 740 civilian deaths in Syria last month may have been caused by bombs dropped on the city by aircraft of the US-led coalition.

“We also see a lot of drone bombs,” said Paul Hatfield, an American volunteer with Kurdish forces. “We had hundreds of them since we started in Raqqa.”

Hatfield said his unit was in a dense neighbourhood about five miles from the city centre, and had been holding the SDF’s western line of attack for the past two weeks. “It’s very dangerous, with a lot of [Isis] snipers,” he said.

The looming fall of the Syrian capital of its so-called caliphate has squeezed Isis east from Raqqa towards Deir ez-Zor and a 200-mile stretch of the Euphrates river valley heading towards Iraq, where senior leaders have sought refuge in the town of Mayadin.



The Euphrates river region is fast emerging as one of the most crucial parts of a country devastated by a multi-faceted war, which international players are increasingly seeking to calm by carving out zones of influence across Syria.



Regional diplomats have earmarked at least five areas in Syria where neighbouring states could potentially help broker localised truces. But the complexity of the conflict and competing agendas has meant binding solutions remain elusive.



Talks in Istanbul, Amman, London and Washington in recent weeks have attempted to game ways that the ultimate fall of Isis will not lead to a further conflagration, which would turn what remains of Syria into an ungovernable rump.



Particular attention has been paid to southern Syria, where Russia has proposed to establish one of four “de-escalation” zones, which would cover the border town of Quneitra and the Golan Heights, where Israel believes Iran is attempting to consolidate a strategic hub.

One proposal put to Moscow is to allow Syrian troops to return to the Jordanian border in return for Iran pulling its forces and proxies from the area. “It’s a long shot,” said an official in Istanbul. “But the Russians are keen to broker a deal. The peace process they started in Astana isn’t working.”



Moscow said it plans to send forces, most likely military police, to Syria within two or three weeks, after concluding a deal with Turkey and Iran. Rex Tillerson, the US secretary of state, told his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, earlier this week that a solution for Syria was now “in Russia’s hands”.



Tillerson has since told senior European diplomats that his remarks were an attempt to “call Russia’s bluff”. However, US allies in the region say the fast declining interest of Washington in crafting any deal suggests further US disengagement.

Eastern Syria, where Isis is preparing a last stand, is one of two areas of the country where the Trump administration retains an interest in the conflict – the other being the north-east, where 6,000 US-backed Kurdish and Arab troops are attacking Isis, diplomats said.

“It is becoming about Iran for them out there,” said one official. “It was about Isis and only Isis. But things are turning. How that works out is anyone’s guess. Though Iran are doing very well. They are patient, intelligent and cautious actors. The Americans have got nothing to counter them. One school of thought is just to leave it to them. But then, what will the Israelis do?”

'Staggering' loss of civilian life from US-led airstrikes in Raqqa, says UN Read more

Israeli military and intelligence officers have been regularly involved in meetings held in Jordan about developments in southern and eastern Syria, and have regularly expressed fears of Iran consolidating a presence in both areas as the war with Isis subsides.



In the heart of Raqqa though, there is little sign of that happening soon. “At the moment in Raqqa we have four fronts,” said Hatfield. “A few days ago we had an offensive where we tried to push as close to the city centre as possible and we are still holding the western line which hasn’t moved in the last 13 days.



“At the moment my unit is in a dense neighbourhood about five [miles] from the city centre, with four to six storey high-rise apartment complexes. The snipers are horrible. They have a major advantage there. They have tunnels connecting every building of the neighbourhood. We blow them up once we move into a new area but they still have more and they manage to move around.

“They are really dug in, they are professional, a lot of them foreigners. Very experienced fighters, they have been fighting for a long time. They try to outflank us with every opportunity.



“I estimate the operation to last three months. The air support has been amazing. We are seeing probably 50 airstrikes per day ... If that keeps up we will continue advancing.”



UN war crimes investigators have denounced a “staggering loss of civilian life” caused by the US-backed campaign to reclaim the city.

Arab-Kurd alliance seals off the jihadists’ last escape route on southern bank of the Euphrates

US-backed fighters pierced jihadist-held Raqqa from the south for the first time on Sunday, crossing the Euphrates River to enter a new part of the Syrian city, a monitor said.



The Syrian Democratic Forces have spent months closing in on the Islamic State group’s bastion Raqqa and entered the city’s east and west for the first time last month.

On Thursday, the US-backed Arab-Kurd alliance sealed off the jihadists’ last escape route by capturing territory on the southern bank of the Euphrates.

“Today, they entered Raqqa’s south for the first time and seized the Al-Hal market,” Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said on Sunday.

He said some SDF fighters had advanced north across the Euphrates River, while others had attacked Al-Hal from the adjacent district of Al-Meshleb in Raqqa’s east.

“The market is fully under SDF control but IS is waging a counter-attack,” Abdel Rahman said.

The SDF’s Operation Wrath of the Euphrates announced it had captured the Al-Hal market on Sunday.

Abdel Rahman also said 11 civilians, including four women and five children, were killed in coalition air strikes on the western Raqqa district of Al-Daraiya late on Sunday.

The new deaths put at more than 200 the civilian toll from coalition raids on Raqqa since the US-backed SDF entered the city on 6 June.

The Observatory said “dozens” of SDF fighters had been killed in Raqqa in the same period, “including 36 in the past week”.

The SDF has since seized a handful of neighbourhoods in the east and west but are facing fierce resistance by Isis as they push closer to the city centre.

SDF fighters were battling Isis on Sunday inside the eastern district of Al-Senaa, which the jihadists retook after an initial advance by the US-backed forces last month.

Al-Senaa is key for both the SDF and Isis because it is adjacent to the city centre, where most Isis fighters defending Raqqa are thought to be holed up.

Isis pushed the SDF out of Al-Senaa on Friday, using dozens of jihadists disguised in SDF uniforms as well as a slew of car bombs.

After two days of a counter-offensive, the SDF had retaken about 70% of it by Sunday, the Observatory said.

“Our forces are about 100 metres from Baghdad Gate,” said Syrian Elite Forces spokesman Mohammad Khaled Shaker, referring to the entrance to Raqqa’s Old City.

“We are combing the area and destroying tunnels to prevent any new infiltrations towards our positions,” Shaker said.

According to the coalition, an estimated 2,500 Isis jihadists are defending the northern city.

Isis overran Raqqa in 2014, transforming it into the de facto Syrian capital of its self-declared “caliphate,” which it declared three years ago.

The city became infamous as the scene of some of the group’s worst atrocities, including public beheadings, and is thought to have been a hub for planning attacks overseas.

The United Nations has expressed concern for up to 100,000 civilians it says are still trapped in the city.

Mahathir Mohamad says former deputy Anwar Ibrahimm, jailed on charges of sodomy, should be freed to contest election against scandal-ridden Najib

Mahathir Mohamad, the father of modern Malaysia, is backing the man he sacked as his deputy and saw imprisoned on charges of sodomy to be prime minister, in an attempt to unseat the scandal-ridden incumbent.

In a remarkable political U-turn ahead of a general election next year, Mahathir now says that his former protege Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia’s most famous political prisoner and its most charismatic public figure, ought to be released from jail and allowed to contest parliamentary elections.

Human rights groups have long said the allegations against Anwar are politically motivated attempts by his opponents, including Mahathir and the current prime minister Najib Razak, to silence him.

Speaking to the Guardian on a visit to London, Mahathir, who in power was accused of being an autocrat, said Anwar is a victim of a political vendetta and that a new administration would seek a royal pardon to allow him to re-enter politics.



Anwar’s lawyers are currently seeking to get him released after evidence emerged that suggested an impartial government-appointed prosecutor was paid a sum equivalent to £2m from a bank account controlled by the prime minister.

“In the case of Anwar we can make a case that he was unfairly treated. The decision of the court was obviously influenced by the government and I think the incoming government would be able to persuade the King to give a full pardon for Anwar,” Mahathir said. “In which case he would be able to participate in politics and become PM. I can have no objection to that.”

Malaysia’s opposition has gained ground in recent years, and nearly toppled the governing party in 2013, winning the popular vote in the general election.

Since then prosecutors have filed a multitude of cases against government critics, including opposition figures, a professor and a cartoonist. A national security act, widely criticised by rights campaigners, came into force last year which gives the army and police sweeping powers for seizure and arrest, and does away with inquests into the deaths of anyone killed in zones declared under a “state of emergency”.

Mahathir stepped down in 2003 after 22 years in office, with no heir apparent. He brooked little dissent during his time in office, and ousted Anwar – seen by many as his natural successor – during a power struggle, ostensibly over an argument over the use of capital controls, in 1998.

A few weeks later Anwar was arrested, beaten by police, then charged with sodomy and corruption. After a trial widely considered to have been politically rigged, he was given a six-year jail term for abuse of power, sparking widespread protests.

Following his release in 2004 he became a leading opposition figure, before returning to prison in 2015 when a court upheld a five-year sentence on another sodomy charge.

Mahathir now accepts he made a mistake by not allowing Anwar to “succeed him”, and that he held on to power for too long, only to anoint two men who subsequently disappointed him, especially the current PM Najib, who is embroiled in one of the world’s largest kleptocracy cases.



According to lawsuits filed by the United States Department of Justice (DoJ), at least $4.5bn has been stolen from a state investment fund 1MDB. The purpose of the fund, which was set up by Najib as prime minister in 2009, was to promote economic development in a country where the median income stands at approximately £300 per month.

Malaysia's Mahathir: strongman turns activist to unseat former protégé Read more

Instead, the DoJ alleged that stolen money from 1MDB found its way to numerous associates of Najib, who subsequently went on a lavish spending spree across the world. It also accused Najib of receiving $681m of cash from 1MDB. Najib has denied that claim, and all other allegations of wrongdoing.

Money from 1MDB, the US also claimed, helped to purchase luxury apartments in Manhattan, mansions in Los Angeles, paintings by Monet, a corporate jet, and even financed the Wolf of Wall St, a major Hollywood movie. Last week Australian model and actress Miranda Kerr handed over $8m of jewelry that US authorities say was given to her as part of a Malaysian money laundering scheme.

“Najib is bad news for Malaysia. For the PM to be accused of stealing huge sums of money, I think that is something we don’t expect of any other PM. Certainly not in Malaysia. The money he is said to have taken is mind boggling,” said Mahathir.

Mahathir remains hugely popular with a broad swath of rural Malay voters who remember the boom years of his rule.

He has registered a new party and is in talks to join the opposition coalition led by Anwar’s party.

He now accepts that the authoritarian turn Malaysia took under his rule – including the use of the colonial-era Internal Security Act to jail troublesome opponents and tighten laws covering protests and the press – needs to be reversed.

Mahathir said he never foresaw a prime minister like Najib who was willing to “implement laws in a much more oppressive way than during my time”.

“Are the checks and balances not good enough? I agree to a certain extent they are not. We in Malaysia live in a multi-racial society and cannot be ever as liberal I think as the USA or Britain. But we should allow free expression in the press. Najib has a new security act that allows him to declare any territory under a state of emergency and detain people without any reason. I inherited and used the law. I did not abolish it and make another one even worse.”

On the second anniversary of the politically-motivated conviction of Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, Amnesty International calls for his immediate and unconditional release.

“The ongoing political persecution of Anwar Ibrahim is symbolic of Malaysia’s crackdown on human rights. He has unjustifiably spent the past two years behind bars on trumped-up charges intended to silence him and end his political career,” said Josef Benedict, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Southeast Asia and the Pacific.

At the last elections, the ruling coalition lost the popular vote but managed to cling on to power. Anwar Ibrahim’s five-year imprisonment makes it impossible for him to contest the next general elections, due to take place by 2018.

Anwar Ibrahim’s conviction was a major blow to human rights as the Malaysian government escalated its attacks on civil society.

Using a slew of draconian, colonial-era laws, the Malaysian government has cracked down on citizens’ rights to freedom of expression and assembly, both online and offline. This has included the harassment, intimidation, arrest and prosecution of activists who have called for Anwar Ibrahim’s release. The authorities have invoked these laws and national security as a pretext to choke dissent, muzzle government critics, and prevent people from taking part in peaceful protests.

The government of Prime Minister Najib Razak had vowed to repeal Malaysia’s Sedition laws but has instead invoked them with even greater frequency.

The famed cartoonist Zunar, who has criticized the conviction and imprisonment of Anwar Ibrahim, faces numerous charges of sedition for tweeting and allegedly insulting Prime Minister Najib Razak and is barred from leaving the country.

In November, Maria Chin Abdullah, the leader of the Bersih movement, was placed in solitary confinement for 11 days after leading a peaceful protest of thousands of people calling for accountability for corruption.

“Every Malaysian has the right to peacefully take part in the affairs of their government, including criticizing people in power. These rights are guaranteed to them by international human rights law,” said Josef Benedict.

“The longer Anwar Ibrahim and other prisoners of conscience remain behind bars, the clearer it becomes that the government has no interest in upholding its international human rights obligations and commitments and instead wishes to use its power to silence anyone it disagrees with.”

Background

Two years have passed since the Federal Court, the apex court of Malaysia on 10 February 2015 upheld the conviction of Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim, de facto leader of the Malaysian opposition and sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment.

Anwar Ibrahim has also exhausted the review process legally available for him to challenge this decision and he is continuing to engage the pardons process.

Activists Sim Tze Tzin, Maria Chin Abdullah, Mohd Fariz Abdul Talib Musa, Mandeep Singh, Adam Adli, Zunar as well as Mohd. Fakhrulrazi were all arrested, investigated, charged or convicted under various Sedition laws or Peaceful Assembly laws, for calling for Anwar Ibrahim’s release.

Uber is pulling its primary service out of Finland as it waits for a law that will deregulate the taxi market to be passed.

The cab firm, which exclusively operates in the nation’s capital Helsinki, is suspending its UberPop service, which allows any driver to sign up and offer unlicensed taxi trips.

“We want to ensure that we do not pose drivers who use our app or our employees any unnecessary issues, especially now that we have a bright future to look forward to. We believe that the best way to do so and focus on the future is to pause UberPop and relaunch in the summer of 2018,” said Joel Järvinen, Uber’s country manager for Finland, in a blog post on Thursday.

“While we are looking forward to the reforms coming into effect, we have decided it is best to pause UberPop from 15 August until the new regulations allow a better environment,” Järvinen added.

Uber’s luxury licensed service, UberBlack, will continue operating in the Finnish capital Helsinki, and Jarvinen said the company is committed to supporting the hundreds of drivers who would no longer be able to make money with UberPop.

Uber is legal in Finland provided its drivers hold valid taxi licences, but the company has been the target of police investigations and drivers have been ordered to give up their earnings to the state for not having valid taxi permits.

Once the new law comes into effect, drivers will still need permits but annual permit quotas and fare restrictions will be removed, which could help new entrants to the market.

Helsinki district court last week ordered Jarvinen’s assets to be confiscated until police conclude an investigation into whether Uber operates an illegal taxi service in Finland.

UberPop is at the heart of many of the company’s legal troubles around the world, since it is the main service that allows unlicensed and unregulated drivers to operate on the platform. It has already been forced out of multiple European cities, including Paris, Brussels and Berlin, and for those locales where demand isn’t high enough to support a licensed option, it has resulted in the company abandoning the place entirely: Frankfurt, Hamburg and Düsseldorf lost their Uber service in 2015, as a result of a German ban on UberPop.

In the UK, where unlicensed taxi operations are strictly against the law and carry a £1,000 fine for drivers caught offering illegal services, UberPOP has never been offered, and Uber drivers must carry a minicab licence – although the company has faced criticism for allowing drivers to work in cities other than the one they hold a licence for.

Medical and legal experts from around the world have united to call for more stringent regulation of stem cell therapies to prevent people pursuing unproven and potentially deadly treatments overseas.

In a perspective piece for the US journal Science Translational Medicine, 15 experts from countries including the UK, the US, Canada, Belgium, Italy and Japan wrote that national efforts alone would not be enough to counter an industry offering unproven treatments to vulnerable patients.

“Stem cell-based interventions are classified under diverse and potentially incompatible national regulatory frameworks,” the authors wrote.

“Approaches for international regulation not only need to develop consistent rules over the commercialisation of medical practices and products but also need to give them teeth by developing cross-border partnerships for compliance.”

Stem cells found in bone marrow and umbilical cord blood have long been used to successfully treat blood cancers including leukaemia and some immune diseases. But those are among the few proven treatments. Legitimate and ethics-approved clinical trials by academic centres are also occurring, exploring the potential of stem cells to treat a wider range of diseases.

But some doctors are directly offering to the general public stem cell treatments for diseases still under clinical trial or for which no evidence exists and for which the safety and efficacy is as yet unproven.

Deaths as a result of stem cell treatments have already occurred. In 2013 Sheila Drysdale died in a New South Wales nursing home after undergoing an unproven liposuction stem-cell therapy at a western Sydney clinic. Following Drysldale’s death, her doctor, Ralph Bright, gave a statement to police in which he claimed that stem-cell treatment could improve “comorbidities” and that stem cells could move from joints to other parts of the body to “improve disease in distant sites including lungs and brain, vision, mentation and pain”.

In his report into Drysdale’s death, the coroner Hugh Dillon wrote that he could not “say what motivated Dr Bright to perform this unproven, dubious procedure on Sheila Drysdale”.



“But regardless of his motivation, Dr Bright’s performance as a medical practitioner was, for the reasons outlined above, poor and resulted in Sheila Drysdale’s death.”

The Medical Council of NSW investigated Bright and placed a number of restrictions on his right to practice. Bright is still authorised to practise stem cell therapy for patients with osteoarthritis or who are taking part in research studies approved by an ethics committee. He is also still allowed to treat patients returning for remaining injections of stored cells.

In 2013 a Queensland woman, Kellie van Meurs, died when she travelled to Russia to undergo stem-cell treatment for a rare neurological disorder. She died of a heart attack as a result.

Australia’s drug regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, last year sought feedback on the regulation of autologous stem-cell therapies but is yet to publish those submissions. A TGA spokeswoman said the Administration was still examining the options for changes to the legislation to reflect public and industry views. The TGA currently considers autologous treatments, which involve treating someone with their own tissue or cells, to be a therapeutic good and, therefore, does not regulate them. Stem cells used for medical practice and therapeutic purposes are covered by different regulatory frameworks.

Associate Professor Megan Munsie, a University of Melbourne stem cell scientist and a co-author of the paper, said: “The idea that stem cells are magical holds court in the community, along with this idea the advances in treatment are being held up by red tape.”

Unethical health practitioners exploited this, she said, along with the vulnerability of patients with difficult-to-treat or incurable conditions.

“There is a precedent for international regulation of this industry because regulations already exist around drugs – the way they are manufactured,” she said.

“This could be extended to the regulation to the stem cell and tissue-based therapies. This international stance would then force or encourage stronger local regulations.”

There have been successful efforts by scientists to push back against unscrupulous doctors. In Italy scientists and regulators highlighted the unproven yet government-subsidised treatments being offered by the entrepreneur Davide Vannoni and fought to stop him. He was convicted of criminal charges but the sentence was later suspended.

Regional rivalry escalates as forces mobilise near borderland that China claims but India says is in Bhutan

China has demanded the withdrawal of Indian troops from a scrap of disputed territory to end an escalating border row between the two Asian powers that has drawn in tiny Bhutan.

Beijing claims the Indian troops are occupying its soil, but both Bhutan and India maintain the area in question is Bhutanese territory.

Analysts maintain that armed conflict between the two Asian powers is unlikely, but say the harsh language and scale of the mobilisation in the remote but strategically important area, where the borders of China, India and Bhutan intersect, is unprecedented in recent years.

One former Indian foreign secretary said the impasse, now in its third week, also marked the first time India and China had squared off on the soil of a third country, an overt display of the escalating regional rivalry between the pair.

The current standoff began on 16 June when a column of Chinese troops accompanied by construction vehicles and road-building equipment began moving south into what Bhutan considers its territory.

Bhutan, a small Himalayan kingdom with close military and economic ties to India, requested assistance from Delhi, which sent forces to resist the Chinese advance.

To avoid escalation, frontline troops in the area do not generally carry weapons, and the Chinese and Indian troops reportedly clashed by “jostling”: bumping chests, without punching or kicking, in order to force the other side backwards.

At the heart of the dispute are different interpretations of where the “trijunction” – the point where the three countries’ borders meet – precisely lies. China argues its territory extends south to an area called Gamochen, while India says Chinese control ends at Batanga La, further to the north.

Around 3,000 troops from both countries are reportedly stationed near Doklam, an area said to be around 15km north of Gamochen.

In support of its claim, China points to an 1890 treaty signed with the British Raj, and seemingly endorsed by India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, in a letter to his Chinese counterpart. India says the letter does not accurately capture Nehru’s position and that China cannot unilaterally alter the territorial status quo.

It is the longest standoff between the two armies since 1962, when tensions over Tibet and elsewhere along the border sparked a brief war from which China emerged victorious.

China still claims a section of the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh and was angered in April when the Dalai Lama, whom Beijing regards as an “anti-China separatist”, conducted a tour of the state.

Though India says its troops in Bhutan are in “non-combative mode”, the rhetoric on both sides is growing increasingly pugilistic. India’s army chief, Bipin Rawat, has said that India is ready to fight a “two and half front war” – referring to Pakistan, China and against the country’s various internal insurgencies.

On Tuesday, an editorial in the Global Times, a Chinese state-run newspaper, called for Delhi to be taught “a bitter lesson”, warning in a second conflict it would suffer greater losses than in 1962.

Srikanth Kondapalli, a professor of Chinese Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, said he believed the standoff would “die down in a little while”, arguing neither country wanted to fight a full-blown war.

“No one is willing to rock the boat, despite all that we have seen,” he said. Rather, as it does in the south China sea, he said Beijing was employing a “salami-slicing” strategy, patiently absorbing small swaths of territory it considers to be its own.

Global attention is usually focused on China’s expansion into east Asia, but the burgeoning superpower is increasingly also muscling into south Asia, forging links with countries India considers to be firmly within its sphere of influence.

“For the past six years China has been attempting to hem India in and take away its strategic space in South Asia,” said Ashok Malik, a fellow at the Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation.

India was especially sensitive to China’s encroachment near its Bhutanese border, he said, because it brought Chinese troops uncomfortably close to a section of Indian territory called the “chicken’s neck”, a thin corridor which, if broached, could cut Delhi off from its northeastern states.

“This is in fact a provocative gesture which makes the defence of Doklam virtually the defence of India,” Malik said. “I don’t expect a conflict, but I expect both sides to stay put as long as Chinese supply and logistical lines will allow.”

Landmark move as first big manufacturer says it will stop making vehicles solely powered by internal combustion engine

All new cars launched by Volvo from 2019 onwards will be partially or completely battery-powered, in what the company called a “historic end” to building models that only have an internal combustion engine.

Between 2019 and 2021, the firm will introduce five 100% electric models, and ensure the rest of its conventional petrol and diesel range has a hybrid engine of some form. It is the first major manufacturer to make such a bold move.

Håkan Samuelsson, the Volvo chief executive, said: “This announcement marks the end of the solely combustion engine-powered car.”

He said the company was reacting to customers who had asked for electric cars, though the move will also help the Swedish firm meet legally-binding carbon targets for new cars sold in the EU from 2020.



Business Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news Read more

The carmaker, owned by Chinese automotive giant Geely, has yet to build a single fully electric car but already sells five plug-in hybrid models that can run a few dozen miles on battery power before switching to a conventional engine.

The pricing of those models suggests drivers will pay a premium for future Volvo cars – the basic plug-in hybrid version of its XC90 SUV crossover costs £61,650, £13,250 more than the basic diesel edition.

Several of the major carmakers, including Renault-Nissan, BMW and VW, have declared ambitious plans for electric cars, supported with grants by governments, which see them as a key way of tackling air pollution and climate change.

The VW emissions scandal gave added impetus for companies to focus on the technology, as politicians and campaigners increasingly blamed diesel for cities’ air quality problems.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Volvo video on its electrification plans.

The cars that Volvo produces from 2019 onwards will range from battery-only to plug-in hybrid – which can run for a significant distance before switching to petrol or diesel – and mild hybrids, where a battery helps a conventional engine achieve greater fuel economy.

Asked if the announcement showed diesel was dead, Samuelsson said: “Long-term, diesel will get more and more expensive, because it requires some after-treatment.” Volvo said in May it was considering ceasing development on next-generation diesel engines.

Of Elon Musk’s Tesla, whose ‘mass market’ Model 3 is expected to roll off the production line later this week, Samuelsson said: “It’s a tough competitor. But with this decision we are really becoming the second premium car maker in the world which will also be all-electrified.”



Volvo said the first of its electric cars will be built in China, but others would be made in Europe and the US. The company said it had not yet decided on a battery supplier.

Prof David Bailey, an automotive expert at Aston University, said: “It’s indicative of the speeding up of the shift over to electrics, particularly in the wake of the VW dieselgate scandal, and it’s a sign that the industry is really starting to move and it will become mainstream.

“By the mid-2020s I expect there to be a tipping point where the electric car starts to outcompete the internal combustion engine. It’s the way it’s going.”

The potential carbon savings of a widespread shift to electric cars are huge.

Although globally coal still accounts for about 40% of electricity generation and gas around 21%, countries such as the UK now source a significant amount of power from low carbon sources, such as renewables and nuclear. A quarter of UK carbon emissions are from road transport.



“We have to decarbonise the transport system, and the shift to electric cars is part of that. Even with the current energy mix, in terms of how we generate electricity, there will be a benefit in CO2, let alone the shift to further renewables,” said Bailey, adding that the cars could also “dramatically improve urban air quality”.



Ben Lane, the director of Next Green Car, a guide to low-emission vehicles, said: “It’s not quite the same as saying they will not make any internal combustion engines, but it’s obviously a key moment.”

Both experts said of all the car companies, Ford was the biggest laggard on the transition to electric vehicles.

Globally, the cumulative number of electric cars broke the 2m barrier last year, up from hundreds in 2005. But as a report published on Wednesday shows, some parts of the world are moving faster than others.

In the EU last year, 1.9% of new car registrations were for hybrids, 0.7% were plug-in hybrids and 0.6% were pure electric. In Norway, the International Council on Clean Transportation found, pure electric models accounted for 15.7% of new car sales in 2016.

While Toyota and its Prius lead on the highest share for hybrids, Renault-Nissan and BMW are top of the pack for pure electric cars. Volvo commanded a considerable share (4.5%) of the plug-in electric market, alongside Porsche on 4.8%.

With bullish projections by Bloomberg New Energy Finance that electric models will make up 35% of all new car sales by 2040, oil companies are increasingly worried about the impact on them. However, firms such as BP are dismissive of the effect the cars will have on oil demand.



Greenpeace hailed the move by Volvo, and said other manufacturers should follow suit.



“Volvo has recognised the huge gains to be made by leading the way in electric. We know electric vehicles are the future, and it’s not a case of if, but when, old-style cars powered by climate-wrecking fossil fuels will be a thing of the past,” said Paul Morozzo, a campaigner at the environmental group.

Volvo’s owner, Geely, also has interests in electric vehicles through its ownership of a £300m factory in Coventry that will build electric black cabs. The first zero-emission versions of the iconic cab, the TX5, will be delivered this year, before new Transport for London rules that require new black cabs to be battery-powered from 1 January.

Idil Eser, head of Amnesty International Turkey, taken away during ‘digital security and information management workshop’

Amnesty International has called for the release of its Turkey director and other activists after they were detained by police.

Idil Eser, the head of Amnesty International Turkey, was taken away on Wednesday along with activists and trainers during a “digital security and information management workshop” on Büyükada, one of the Princes’ Islands off Istanbul, the human rights organisation said in a statement.

Turkey arrests Amnesty International head and lawyers in Gulenist sweep Read more

The daily newspaper Hürriyet said a total of 12 people were arrested in a police raid on a hotel on the island, a popular retreat with Istanbul residents.

There was no immediate comment from the police or indication of why the rights activists were being held.

Salil Shetty, Amnesty International’s secretary general, said: “We are profoundly disturbed and outraged that some of Turkey’s leading human rights defenders, including the director of Amnesty International Turkey, should have been detained so blatantly without cause.”

He said they must be immediately and unconditionally released. The whereabouts of those detained were unknown.

The detentions come less than a month after Amnesty International’s Turkey chairman, Taner Kiliç, was remanded in custody on what the group described as “baseless charges” of links to Fethullah Gülen, who is accused of masterminding the failed coup on 15 July 2016. Gülen denies any involvement.

Turkey remains under a state of emergency imposed in the wake of the coup attempt aimed at ousting President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Critics say the emergency has been used to round up not just the alleged plotters but anyone who dares oppose the president.

Turkish officials insist that all actions are carried out within the framework of the law.

Amnesty said the seven other activists detained included Ilknur Üstün of the Women’s Coalition, lawyer Günal Kursun and Veli Acu of the Human Rights Agenda Association.

Two foreign trainers for the workshop – a German and a Swedish national – as well as the hotel owner, were also detained in the raid, it added.

The Reddit user whose gif was appropriated by Donald Trump in the president’s infamous CNN-wrestling video has apologized for creating the image – and for making a series of racist, antisemitic and Islamophobic posts.

HanAssholeSolo, who claimed to have created the gif that inspired Trump to post a video of him wrestling a man with a CNN logo superimposed on his head, said he was “trolling” when he used a series of racial slurs on Reddit, and said his gif had been “satire” that was not meant to call for violence against journalists. HanAssholeSolo’s apology came after CNN reportedly identified him.

Reddit user who took credit for Trump's CNN tweet has history of racist posts Read more

The Reddit user had faced criticism after it emerged he had repeatedly used racial slurs and posted antisemitic images to the site. In one post, HanAssholeSolo called for another commenter to “keep up the good work until the last Islamic piece of shit is wiped from the planet”.

Trump is yet to apologize for sharing the video; it is unclear how the president discovered HanAssholeSolo’s post. The White House did not respond to requests for comment on Monday, but the revelations about HanAssholeSolo’s past added to questions about the president’s internet use and sourcing.

In July 2016, Trump tweeted an antisemitic image attacking Hillary Clinton. It was later reported that the image had been taken from an internet message board used by white supremacists.

HanAssholeSolo issued his apology in a lengthy post to Reddit on Tuesday.

“First of all, I would like to apologize to the members of the Reddit community for getting this site and this sub embroiled in a controversy that should never have happened,” he wrote.

“I would also like to apologize for the posts made that were racist, bigoted, and antisemitic. I am in no way this kind of person, I love and accept people of all walks of life and have done so for my entire life.

“I am not the person that the media portrays me to be in real life, I was trolling and posting things to get a reaction from the subs on reddit and never meant any of the hateful things I said in those posts. I would never support any kind of violence or actions against others simply for what they believe in, their religion, or the lifestyle they choose to have.

“Nor would I carry out any violence against anyone based upon that or support anyone who did.”

The post has since been removed from Reddit, and HanAssholeSolo has deleted his account. In the apology he said he did not “advocate violence against the press” and that the meme “was created purely as satire”.

“I had no idea anyone would take it and put sound to it and then have it put up on the president’s Twitter feed.

“It was a prank, nothing more. What the president’s feed showed was not the original post that was posted here, but loaded up somewhere else and sound added to it then sent out on Twitter. I thought it was the original post that was made and that is why I took credit for it.

“I have the highest respect for the journalist community and they put their lives on the line every day with the jobs that they do in reporting the news.”

On Monday, CNN said it had identified the man behind the HanAssholeSolo account. The news organization said it was not publishing his name “because he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology, showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all his offending posts, and because he said he is not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again”.

CNN said it “reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change”.

CNN says Trump ‘below the dignity of his office’, CPJ director says tweet ‘undermines US media’ and Sasse says president ‘trying to weaponise distrust’

Donald Trump was on Sunday accused of encouraging his supporters to attack journalists, after he tweeted a video of himself at a pro-wrestling event throwing to the floor a man with a CNN logo for a head.

The video, sent as CNN broadcast its Sunday talk show State of the Union, came the morning after an appearance from Trump at an event in Washington honouring veterans, in which he used his speech to further his attacks on the press and broadcasters. “The fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House. But I’m president, and they’re not,” he said.



CNN said in a statement that Trump was encouraging violence against reporters and “involved in juvenile behaviour far below the dignity of his office”.

A director of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) told the Guardian “charged rhetoric online”, issued by the White House, “undermines the media in the US and emboldens autocratic leaders around the world”.

Trump’s tweet contained doctored video from his appearance on Wrestlemania XXIII in 2007, in which he “body-slammed” – and subsequently shaved bald – Vince McMahon, the WWE promoter and husband of Trump’s Small Business Administration chief, Linda McMahon. Trump is a member of the WWE hall of fame. The video appeared to have been repurposed from Reddit, where it was posted as a gif by a user named “HanAssholeSolo”.

In an atmosphere of swirling distrust between journalists and the politicians they cover, “body-slamming” became a loaded term in May when a Republican congressional candidate in Montana slammed Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs to the floor.

Greg Gianforte pleaded guilty to assault and was sentenced to community service. After donating $50,000 to the CPJ, he was sworn in as a member of the US House of Representatives. Jacobs’ glasses, broken in the assault, are now on display at the Newseum in Washington.

In its statement on Sunday, CNN said: “It is a sad day when the president of the United States encourages violence against reporters. Clearly [deputy White House press secretary] Sarah Huckabee Sanders lied when she said the president had never done so.

“Instead of preparing for his overseas trip, his first meeting with Vladimir Putin, dealing with North Korea and working on his healthcare bill, he is instead involved in juvenile behaviour far below the dignity of his office. We will keep doing our jobs. He should start doing his.”

Courtney Radsch, advocacy director for the CPJ, told the Guardian: “Singling out individual journalists and news outlets creates a chilling effect and fosters an environment where further harassment and even physical attacks are seen to be acceptable.

“We are already concerned about physical attacks on reporters and clearly the White House’s charged rhetoric online undermines the media in the US and emboldens autocratic leaders around the world. We already saw that there has been at least one serious attack recently, on Ben Jacobs, a reporter for the Guardian, and this does not create a positive environment for the press online or offline.”

On ABC’s This Week, homeland security adviser Thomas Bossert was asked if the president’s tweet could be seen as a threat or as encouragement for supporters to attack members of the media.

“Certainly not,” he said. “No one would perceive that as a threat, I hope they don’t. But I do think that he’s beaten up, in a way, on cable platforms.”

Trump was “the most genuine president and the most non-politician president that we’ve seen in my lifetime”, Bossert added. “Whatever the content is of that tweet or any particular tweet he’s demonstrated an ability to talk to the American people.”

Bossert was following a line pursued by senior officials and the president himself, that Trump’s use of Twitter allows him to speak directly to the public, bypassing media bias, and that his use of insult is only a response to provocation.

In the tweet, which was retweeted from the official @Potus account, the president wrote only: “#FraudNewsCNN #FNN.”

The tweet was issued shortly after the Nebraska Republican senator Ben Sasse told CNN’s State of the Union talk show: “There’s an important to distinction to draw between bad stories and crappy coverage and the right citizens have to argue about that and complain about that, and trying to weaponise distrust.”

Sasse, who said journalism in the age of social media was producing “a recipe for a new kind of tribalism”, spoke at the end of a week in which three senior CNN journalists resigned over a story that linked a member of the Trump transition team with the head of a Russian investment fund. Sasse said the departures were “a good thing”.

'Dumb as a rock Mika': Donald Trump back on attack against Morning Joe hosts Read more

Trump, who has called the media “enemies of the American people”, subsequently included CNN in a series of angry tweets about “fake news”, including the network on a roster of enemies now including Joe Scarborough and Mike Brzezinski, MSNBC hosts who claim to have been the subject of attempted blackmail by White House officials.

On Saturday, Trump insulted “Crazy Joe Scarborough and dumb as a rock Mika”.

He later wrote: “The FAKE & FRAUDULENT NEWS MEDIA is working hard to convince Republicans and others I should not use social media – but remember, I won the 2016 election with interviews, speeches and social media. I had to beat #FakeNews, and did. We will continue to WIN!

“I am thinking about changing the name #FakeNews CNN to #FraudNewsCNN!

“My use of social media is not Presidential – it’s MODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL. Make America Great Again!”

Amidst widespread social media comment on the president’s tweet, Harry Potter author JK Rowling tweeted a dignified quote from former president George Washington: “To persevere in one’s duty, and be silent, is the best answer to calumny.”

Comedian Ricky Gervais wrote: “Imagine a kindergarten principal tweeting, ‘The little fucker punched me first.’ People in power should act differently. That is all.”

Actress Mia Farrow defended the press and the law that guarantees freedom of expression. “Stop this nonsense Mr President! The First Amendment is among our most treasured freedoms,” she wrote.

Musician John Legend simply tweeted “25th Amendment” – the amendment to the constitution that concerns the replacement of a president in the event of his or her incapacity, death, removal or resignation.

Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of Trump’s election opponent, tweeted: “July 2, 1776: Continental Congress votes for independence. July 2, 2017: Trump auditions for WWE,” she tweeted.

(CNN) The Reddit user who initially claimed credit for President Donald Trump's tweet that showed Trump tackling CNN issued an apology Tuesday for the video and other offensive content he posted -- one day after CNN identified the man behind the account and attempted to make contact with him.

Reddit user "HanA**holeSolo" first shared the GIF last Wednesday of Trump pummeling a wrestler with CNN's logo imposed on his face. CNN could find no earlier instance of the GIF. The GIF was later edited into a video with sound and tweeted by the President on Sunday.

On Reddit, "HanA**holeSolo" took credit for inspiring the tweet. Soon after, "HanA**holeSolo's" other posts on Reddit, some of which included racist and anti-Semitic imagery, quickly circulated on social media.

Now the user is apologizing, writing in a lengthy post on Reddit that he does not advocate violence against the press and expressing remorse there and in an interview with CNN for other posts he made that were racist and anti-Semitic.

The apology came after CNN's KFile identified the man behind "HanA**holeSolo." Using identifying information that "HanA**holeSolo" posted on Reddit, KFile was able to determine key biographical details, to find the man's name using a Facebook search and ultimately corroborate details he had made available on Reddit.

On Monday, KFile attempted to contact the man by email and phone but he did not respond. On Tuesday, "HanA**holeSolo" posted his apology on the subreddit /The_Donald and deleted all of his other posts.

"First of all, I would like to apologize to the members of the reddit community for getting this site and this sub embroiled in a controversy that should never have happened," he wrote. "I would also like to apologize for the posts made that were racist, bigoted, and anti-semitic. I am in no way this kind of person, I love and accept people of all walks of life and have done so for my entire life. I am not the person that the media portrays me to be in real life, I was trolling and posting things to get a reaction from the subs on reddit and never meant any of the hateful things I said in those posts. I would never support any kind of violence or actions against others simply for what they believe in, their religion, or the lifestyle they choose to have. Nor would I carry out any violence against anyone based upon that or support anyone who did."

The user further apologized for calls for violence against the press in his statement on Reddit.

"The meme was created purely as satire, it was not meant to be a call to violence against CNN or any other news affiliation," he wrote. "I had no idea anyone would take it and put sound to it and then have it put up on the President's Twitter feed. It was a prank, nothing more. What the President's feed showed was not the original post that was posted here, but loaded up somewhere else and sound added to it then sent out on Twitter. I thought it was the original post that was made and that is why I took credit for it. I have the highest respect for the journalist community and they put their lives on the line every day with the jobs that they do in reporting the news."

The apology has since been taken down by the moderators of /The_Donald subreddit.

After posting his apology, "HanA**holeSolo" called CNN's KFile and confirmed his identity. In the interview, "HanA**holeSolo" sounded nervous about his identity being revealed and asked to not be named out of fear for his personal safety and for the public embarrassment it would bring to him and his family.

CNN is not publishing "HanA**holeSolo's" name because he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology, showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all his offending posts, and because he said he is not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again. In addition, he said his statement could serve as an example to others not to do the same.

CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change.

After Trump tweeted the video on Sunday, "HanA**holeSolo" took to Reddit to say he was "honored," writing "Holy s—!! I wake up and have my morning coffee and who retweets my s—post but the MAGA EMPORER himself!!! I am honored!!" MAGA is an acronym for the President's campaign slogan: Make America great again."

In the phone interview on Tuesday, "HanA**holeSolo" said the White House did not ask his permission to use the GIF, and said he probably would have said no if they had.

"I didn't realize that post would be picked up the way it was, he said. "I should have never even said anything."

Trump has not issued an apology for the tweet, which he sent Sunday morning. Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert said on ABC's This Week that "no one would perceive" the tweet as a threat.

The Committee to Protect Journalists said in a statement this week that the tweet "undermines the work of the media in the U.S. and makes it more dangerous." CNN said in a statement that the tweet "encourages violence against reporters."

On Monday, a senior administration official told CNN that the video was not pulled from Reddit. The White House still has not responded to a series of questions from CNN asking how the video ended up as a tweet from the President.

"HanA**holeSolo" said about the President's tweet, "I think they should have used their better judgment, since the President tweets things off the cuff, it's a kneejerk reaction. I don't feel that they should have posted something like that given the controversy going on between them and the media."

When asked specifically about his other posts that consisted of racist, Islamophobic, and anti-Semitic language and imagery, he answered, "I love people of all races, creeds and origins. One of my best friends is a homosexual and one of my best friends is Jewish and one of my best friends is Muslim."

In his apology on Reddit, "HanA**holeSolo" sent a message to his fellow anonymous posters.

"To people who troll on the Internet for fun, consider your words and actions conveyed in your message and who it might upset or anger," he wrote. "Put yourself in their shoes before you post it. If you have a problem with trolling it is an addiction just like any other addiction someone can have to something and don't be embarrassed to ask for help. Trolling is nothing more than bullying a wide audience. Don't feed your own self-worth based upon inflicting suffering upon others online just because you are behind a keyboard."

Tens of thousands of joyful New Zealanders have braved a thunderstorm in Auckland to welcome home the America’s Cup winners, who held the Auld Mug aloft on these shores for the first time in 17 years.

The Emirates Team New Zealand members waved at the crowd from the backs of vans for a slow, noisy procession down Queen Street to Waitemata Harbour, where they boarded a boat for a victory tour on the sea – dozens of yachts, sea kayaks and dingies floating by to catch a glimpse.

Many people skipped work and school on Thursday to watch the parade live, not wanting to miss out on the historic moment.

Daryl and Liz Kirk brought their two young daughters – nabbing prime positions outside Aotea Square and setting up camping chairs to ensure no one stole their spot – a full two hours before it began at lunchtime.

America's Cup: New Zealand celebrates 'underdog' victory over billionaires Read more

“This is a pretty historic event for us as Kiwis and we wanted the kids to be here and remember it,” said Daryl.

“Being a Kiwi means doing your best with not many resources, and being far away, but these boys are the world’s best, and as you can see today the whole country is really proud of what they’ve achieved. We all love it.”

The parade started in sunshine and ended amid claps of thunder and torrential rain. Office workers pressed themselves against windows to watch and builders paused on their scaffolding high above the city to whoop and yell.

Seagulls swooped above the cheering crowd dancing to a brass band version of James Brown’s I Feel Good. Some people had travelled from around the North Island to shout “Kiwi, Kiwi” and “Peter, Peter!” for helmsman Peter Burling, who, at 26, is the youngest person to ever win the America’s Cup, and an instant hero for locals with his uncanny resemblance to Sir Edmund Hillary.

“I wanted to support the team, I felt so happy and excited when they won,” said 14-year-old Ace Mead who missed school with her three sisters to attend the parade.

“I think the team won because they had courage and faith, and they had the whole country behind them. I got up to watch every game with my Dad.”

Many of the team – dressed in black and blue tracksuits – looked worn out from their feat in Bermuda, but their faces cracked into huge grins as the crowd embraced them, throwing colourful streamers over their heads and waving handmade signs.

This week the government announced NZ$5m in funding for the team to try and keep their sailing talent in New Zealand, but today Australian skipper Glenn Ashby told TVNZ he had already received phone calls from rival teams trying to poach him.

“I think all the guys are highly sought after because we have been able to pull of something absolutely fantastic” he said.

A number of the sailors bowed their heads at the start of the parade to hide puffy eyes, blinking back tears they were unable to control. Having only arrived back in the country yesterday, they have yet to see some friends and family, and many said they were keen for a few quiet days to recoup and process before journeying south for parades in Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.

“Thank you for your display of what is best about a small country from the bottom of the world,” said the prime minister, Bill English, from a podium by Waitemata harbour, his grey suit drooping in the rain.

“You are a group of ordinary Kiwis who have done something extraordinary,” he said, before giving cause for laughter with one of his characteristic stumbles: “You’ll also be helping Kiwis get off the shelf … ah, off the couch.”

Two and a half hours before dawn broke in the southern hemisphere thousands of New Zealanders crawled from their warm beds to cheer for a team of youthful underdogs who have remained stoic and inscrutable throughout an America’s Cup regatta that has featured a dramatic capsize, constant sledging and a team budget that looks like pocket money to their competitors.

After the devastating 2013 defeat to Oracle in San Francisco the home crowds kept their hopes for victory in check, and right up until the end were careful with their tenses. There was no when we win the cup. Only if, if, if.

“The loss in San Francisco was horrific for the whole country and no-one was going to celebrate till they crossed that line,” said Nick Wrinch, the commodore of the Tauranga Yacht and Power Boat Club, where New Zealand helmsman Peter Burling – the youngest ever to win an America’s Cup – learnt to sail as a kid. “The team didn’t have much money and that was almost an advantage because it made them think, it forced them to get creative on a small budget. And I think that was a huge part of their success.”

At the Yacht Research Unit at Auckland University, absenteeism by a few bleary-eyed mechanical engineering academics would be overlooked today, said associate professor Peter Richards.

Like New Zealand prime minister Bill English, who posted a video of himself celebrating victory in his pyjamas, Richards got up to watch the final hurdle on his lounge-room telly.

“On a good day there can be thousands of boats on Auckland harbour, from tiny one-maners to the mega yachts,” said Richards, who hoped Burling might return to his mechanical engineering degree at university, but since the win today, realised this may be a rather unlikely prospect for the celebrated sportsman. “It is something that is a very real part of New Zealand’s identity, and this team were willing to take risks, they had nothing to lose.”

A 10-minute walk down the hill on the shore of the Waitemata harbour hundreds of people gasped and groaned their way through the early-morning race event at the New Zealand Maritime Museum, clutching hot drinks in the dark and waiting for the moment of release when coffee could be substituted for champagne. A restaurant nearby was offering free glasses to jubilant diners all day, and full bottles for tables of four.



When the win finally came, hope turned to relief and then to joy. “It got really wild here, it was quite incredible and very special,” says Samantha Alexander of the maritime museum, who watched the final race surrounded by Kiwi maritime history.

“For weeks there has been this tension building, this really careful, cautious optimism – no one wanted to jinx it. But we are an island surrounded by a huge ocean: sailing is in our blood.”



Some 241km north of Auckland in the small coastal town of Kerikeri commodore Doug France and around 40 locals gathered at the yacht club to watch local boy Blair Tuke cross the finish line, focused and clinical to the very end – miles calmer than his friends and family back home.

“We were extremely nervous, I’ve been very nervous for over a week now,” said France. “Blair has been sailing here since he was a kid, he was always going to be a natural sailor, he has a real affinity with the water. But it is his partnership with Burling that has set them alight, they have incredible rhythm together and make each other the best they can be.”

The America’s Cup was only available live on satellite television to New Zealanders, so many had followed “old-school” radio and newspaper reports, said professor Mark Orams, the head of the sport and recreation school at Auckland University of Technology.



Celebrations tonight will be low-key, said Orams. A couple of quiet beers with ex-members of Team New Zealand – and a toast to the disciplined, steely dignity of the victorious team.

A street parade in Auckland next week to welcome the boys home was expected to draw thousands, and that would be the time for bells and whistles. Tonight though, for many, was marked largely by relief.



“The team was focused on quiet, steady improvements, they were incredibly composed throughout this whole regatta; they just stayed even, whatever happened their reaction was the same,” said Orams, who has spent weeks live-blogging the race, translating sailing jargon for the increasingly invested Kiwis.



“It always feels like you’re the underdog here, because we’re so small, we’re so remote. But Team New Zealand were the thought leaders in this race, they had brave ideas and they put them into action. That made them the leaders and every other team the followers throughout, everyone else was playing catch-up to New Zealand.”



Back in Tauranga, Burling’s patch, the Yacht and Power Boat Club has been fielding calls from young, wannabe sailors all day; wanting to sign up, wanting to learn how to sail, wanting to get on a boat this Saturday morning and lean fiercely into a southerly wind.



“We saw it since Pete was a kid, stick him in a boat and it doesn’t take him long to communicate with the boat,” said Wrinch, whose club caved in and bought a satellite TV package just ten days ago so they could watch the races live. “I hope it’s like that with the new kids too. Because judging by this morning’s calls, there’s going to be a lot of them.”

Executive at search engine giant talked about the smooth ride during video call to Beijing conference. The only problem is self-driving cars are banned in China

Tech company executives often like to call themselves disruptors, shaking things up in the hope of making a better world. But to Beijing police, the CEO of Chinese technology giant Baidu might simply be another unlicensed driver.



Robin Li placed a video call to an AI developer conference while riding in the passenger seat of a self-driving car on Wednesday. During the call, the head of the search engine company said the car was on autopilot and remarked on the smooth ride despite the traffic.

Another company executive is sitting in the driver’s seat, but not touching the wheel, as the car cruises down a busy Beijing highway.

But when a video of the stunt went viral, police launched an investigation, saying it appeared to violate Chinese highway laws.

China has banned driverless cars from public roads until the government legislates rules governing their use and safety standards. In the meantime, the maximum penalty is thought to be only £20 for driving without a licence, although the car is likely to be confiscated, according to a lawyer interviewed by news site Sixth Tone.

Traffic police “attach great importance to this matter and are actively carrying out investigations and verification”, the authorities said via social media.

Baidu announced this week it has partnered with 50 companies for its driverless car project, which will be open-source akin to Google’s Android operating system. It plans to put fully self-driving cars on the streets by 2018, with mass production starting in 2021.

Chinese business culture has long prized a “do first, ask forgiveness later” approach, and China’s bureaucracy is often slow to adopt the necessary laws for new technologies. The proliferation of dockless bike sharing schemes is one prominent example, with companies flooding cities with bikes, sparking a backlash from local authorities.

Baidu declined to comment.

Decision by ABN Amro, which has six millions customers worldwide, is the first by a major bank in The Netherlands

The Netherlands’ third-largest bank ABN Amro said Wednesday that it is ratcheting up its battle against smoking and will no longer extend credit to clients in the tobacco industry.



The Amsterdam-based bank’s decision came as it announced a new partnership with the national Heart Foundation in the fight against smoking, which kills some 20,000 people every year in the country of 17 million, according to a recent study.

'It has had a real social impact': readers on the smoking ban ten years on Read more

“Our core value is that everybody has a right to be healthy,” said Marianne Verhaar, the bank’s director of relationship management for institutions and charitable organisations.

“The core activity of those in the tobacco industry is not compatible with our core values,” she told AFP.

“Therefore we have drawn up a moratorium when it comes to extending credit to tobacco producers.”

The move also stops any new investment in the tobacco industry and is the first by a major bank in The Netherlands, the Trouw newspaper reported.

“The move could have a big impact. It means that other banks and investment funds would also have to take a stand,” the paper said.

Existing contracts with tobacco industry clients will be respected, but will not be renewed and no new contracts will be signed, an ABM Amro official told the daily.

Verhaar said ABN Amro was planning to lobby others in the Dutch financial sector to follow its lead.

Smoking rate in UK falls to second-lowest in Europe Read more

The bank, which has more than six million clients worldwide, decided to change its tobacco policy around the end of April, she said.

Its new partnership with the Heart Foundation includes looking at ways to integrate a payment-sharing app with the foundation’s fund-raising activities.

A recent study by the Amsterdam-based SEO Economic Research company estimated the cost of smoking to Dutch society at around 2,000 euros ($2,200) per person per year.

The World Health Organisation attributes more than seven million deaths world-wide to tobacco use every year.

Shinzo Abe to meet Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels – but UK exporters likely to see no gain due to Brexit

The European Union and Japan are on course to sign a trade deal on Thursday, after talks gained impetus in the wake of Donald Trump’s threat to put up barriers to international commerce.

Cecilia Malmström, the European trade commissioner, announced she had reached a political agreement with the Japanese foreign minister, Fumio Kishida: “We ironed out the few remaining differences in the EU-Japan trade negotiations,” she tweeted. “We now recommend to leaders to confirm this at summit.”

Japanese prime minister Shinzō Abe will meet Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker, presidents of the European council and commission respectively, for a one- day summit in Brussels, before the G20 gathering in Hamburg.

Japan seeks early free trade talks with UK amid Brexit fears Read more

The timing is no coincidence, as Germany plans to make free trade one of the summit priorities.

In a sign of high hopes, Malmström and Kishida exchanged Daruma dolls, armless, headless round figures associated with persistence and luck. A part of Zen Buddhist culture, people typically paint one eye when they make a wish and the second when the goal has been reached. Malmström and Kishida posed for the cameras, as they coloured in the second eyes on two dolls emblazoned with the EU and Japanese flags.

But officials might be looking for divine intervention to overcome the final hurdles.

Despite a likely agreement on Thursday, the sensitive subject of a court system to settle investor disputes remains open. Japan has not accepted the EU’s preferred alternative to the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), a system for resolving trade disputes that has been criticised by unions and activists for giving too much power to corporations. Under pressure from NGOs, the EU proposed a new kind of trade court, where judges would be appointed by governments rather than disputing parties. But Tokyo has not come round to this idea.

EU sources declined to speculate on how quickly the deal could come into force, but fine-tuning and translating the legal text, as well as getting it agreed by all EU member states could take many months.

It took the EU and Canada three years to sign a final text, following the agreement in principle in October 2013, which parallels the latest EU-Japan milestone. The Canada deal almost collapsed when a Belgian region threatened to veto the treaty. Now mostly in force, the EU-Canada deal still needs to clear the final hurdle of ratification by at least 38 national and regional assemblies.

Records come round again: Sony to open vinyl factory in Japan Read more

The timetable means it is likely the UK will have left the EU by the time the Japan treaty comes into force.

When negotiations began with Tokyo in 2013, Britain was one of the biggest cheerleaders. The then UK trade minister described talks as an “important step towards liberalising trade between two of the world’s largest economies”.

Following the Brexit vote, Theresa May has vowed to leave the customs union, meaning British exporters are unlikely to see any benefits from the EU deal.

The deal means Japan will drop tariffs on many valuable European imports, including chocolate, pasta and some types of cheese.

In return for liberalisation of Japan’s highly protected dairy market, Europe has compromised by agreeing to lower tariffs on Japanese imported cars, although new rules will be phased in to help European carmakers deal with the change.

Services and an array of technical standards are also covered by the treaty, which negotiators say goes far further than old-style tariff-cutting agreements.

The financial markets have been rocked by Donald Trump’s victory in the US election, but what are the president elect’s policies?

After a long and bitter campaign for the US presidency, Donald Trump has triumphed over Hillary Clinton and the world’s financial markets have been rocked.

For Trump’s supporters he represents a chance to shake up a system that many Americans feel has increased inequality and squeezed living standards. For less complacent investors, there are worries Trump’s anti-globalisation mantra will spread protectionism around the world, put up trade barriers and curb global economic growth. Furthermore, markets do not like unknowns and with Trump going to the White House they are dealing with a complete newcomer to politics. His administration is widely expected to mark a departure from the policies of his own Republican party as well as the outgoing Democrats.

So what do we know about Trump’s economic policies? We look at the key areas:

Trade

Tapping into economic discontent Trump has argued for protectionism and asserted that decades of free-trade policies were responsible for the collapse of the American manufacturing industry. He has been feeding on the perception among many Americans that globalisation has brought more pain than gain, for example, by bringing cheap consumer goods into the country, costing domestic jobs and depressing wages. Outsourcing of jobs to cheaper markets has also been a concern. Against that backdrop, Trump’s stance on trade is perhaps the clearest of his economic policies.

The billionaire Republican wants to renegotiate, or possibly even scrap, the North American Free Trade Agreement. Nafta lowers trade barriers between the US, Canada and Mexico and was negotiated by George HW Bush and enacted in the 1990s by Bill Clinton. The incoming president wants Nafta to offer a better deal for Americans and has rejected claims by his opponents that the deal has helped the US economy by opening up export markets.

The protectionism with regard to Mexico does not stop there. One of Trump’s most notorious pledges in the presidential campaign was to build a multibillion-dollar wall along the US southern border and force Mexico to pay for it. On the markets on Wednesday fears over the blow to Mthe Mexican economy from Trump’s victory have sent the peso plummeting.

Other global trade deals are also now very much in doubt, notably the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), between 12 countries around the Pacific rim, excluding China, and the agreement being negotiated between the US and Europe, known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).

In terms of trade deals, both TTIP and the TPP now look dead in the water

Philip Shaw, an economist at the bank Investec, says: “While we are minded to disregard some of Mr Trump’s wilder pre-election rhetoric, we consider that there is a tangible risk that a Trump presidency could fuel anti-globalisation momentum and spark a wave of protectionist policies around the globe. In terms of trade deals, both TTIP and the TPP now look dead in the water.”

Trump has also made his anger with China over trade well known, arguing that since China joined the World Trade Organisation, Americans have witnessed the closure of more than 50,000 factories and the loss of tens of millions of jobs. He wants the US government to label China a “currency manipulator” and has lambasted the rapidly growing Asian economy for “unfair subsidy behaviour”.

Taxes

Here again, Trump has played into frustrations among many Americans over their sense of financial insecurity, inequality and squeezed incomes. Trump, who has faced fierce criticism for appearing to escape paying income tax himself for almost two decades, promised tax cuts for all income groups.



He has pledged “a massive tax reduction” for working and middle-income Americans and has vowed to eliminate income taxes for individuals who earn less than $25,000 annually, or $50,000 for a married couple. He has also said he would “ensure the rich pay their fair share”. But analysis by the conservative Tax Foundation has found Trump’s tax plan would disproportionately help the richest Americans, saving them millions.

Trump has also supported lower corporate taxes, proposing to cut the business tax rate from 35% to 15%. He wants to close special interest tax loopholes and to restrict companies from moving money out of the country. He has also proposed a corporate tax repatriation plan – to encourage US companies which hoard cash overseas to avoid paying the 35% tax to bring that cash back to the US. According to Capital Economics this cash hoard is now $2.5tn. A tax holiday – so the tax due would be only 10% for a period – could encourage corporations to bring back cash to invest or distribute to shareholders

Public finances

All those tax cuts mean less coming in to government coffers, at least in the near-term. There is an argument that the potential boost to businesses and to household spending power would lift the economy enough to improve government finances. But, for now, economists expect that Trump’s plans for tax cuts across the board will mean the US taking on more debt as its deficit – the gap between spending and income – swells.

Kevin Logan, the chief US economist at the bank HSBC, says: “Reducing the budget deficits, while cutting tax rates at the same time, will be difficult without sizable cutbacks in federal spending. If a Trump administration manages to push through tax cuts with matching spending cuts, federal budget deficits, which are already trending higher, will probably increase substantially, in our view.”

Obamacare

Trump wants to repeal and replace president Barack Obama’s healthcare plan, introduced under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), with his own, cheaper plan for tax-free health savings accounts (HSAs). On the campaign trail, Trump called Obamacare an expensive “disaster”.

About 20 million more people have insurance thanks to the ACA but the scheme has struggled to run efficiently because it relies on competition between insurers to provide affordable coverage, and that competition has dwindled.



Immigration

The most high-profile Trump plan on immigration is for a wall along the Mexican border. He also said he would deport 11 million undocumented migrants, something opponents say is physically impossible. He wants immigrants to be selected on the basis of “their likelihood of success in the US and their ability to be financially self-sufficient”.

Jobs and growth

Unemployment in the US has dropped below 5%, a good record on the surface for Obama. But during his campaign, Trump has focused on those parts of the economy and country where the recovery since the financial crash has not being felt, gaining traction with those Americans who have seen their industries diminish and their wages stagnate.

On the campaign trail, Trump chose the once booming industrial centre of Detroit to set out his economic plan. He cited the motor city’s higher-than-average unemployment rate and crime levels in a speech that played on widespread worries about the decline of US manufacturing.

Trump has said his protectionist policies will keep “jobs and wealth inside the United States” . He has promised to increase employment, saying his plans for lower taxes, trade barriers and tighter immigration rules would lead to stronger economic growth. As with the deficit, many economists warn his plans could make things worse not better, hindering economic growth and thereby employers’ ability to create new jobs.

Trump has bemoaned the deteriorating conditions of American infrastructure but has provided little detail on what big spending projects he would undertake. In his victory speech he said: “We are going to fix our inner cities, and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We’re going to rebuild our infrastructure ... and we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.”

Interest rates

This is not strictly an area for the government, given interest rates are set by the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, widely referred to as the Fed. But there were worries during the presidential race that a win for Trump would undermine its independence and the position of its chairwoman, Janet Yellen.

The president-elect has previously accused the Fed of keeping borrowing costs low to help president Obama and has said the central bank’s policies have created a “false economy”.

In April he said he would be inclined to replace Yellen. In an interview with Fortune magazine, Trump also said he “absolutely” backed efforts to diminish the Fed’s power. Yellen began a four-year term as Fed chairwoman under Obama in February 2014.

Fed policymakers had hinted at another rate rise in December, part of the slow process of bringing policy back to more normal levels after drastic measures to shore up the US economy during the global financial crisis. But investors now think a move next month is off the table given the shock to markets from Trump’s victory and the economic uncertainty that lies ahead.



In the longer-term, more spending and tax cuts from the government – in other words looser fiscal policy – could usher in tighter monetary policy with a more interest rate hikes from the Fed.

Climate change

Trump’s victory has sparked alarm and dismay among environmentalists fearful he will reverse many of the green measures introduced under Obama. Caroline Lucas, the co-leader of the UK’s Green party, described the Republican’s win as “a hammer blow for the fight against climate change”.

In the past the real estate mogul has dismissed global warming as an “expensive hoax”. Now his election to the US presidency has thrown the historic Paris agreement into uncertainty just days after it officially came into force. Trump has threatened to to withdraw the US from the deal to cut greenhouse gases, which took 20 years to negotiate.

By contrast, Trump has indicated he would promote coal, shale gas and oil and there are worries he will curb investment into renewable energy sources as well as funding for the Environmental Protection Agency. He has pledged to scrap regulations for America’s coal industry, a stance that won him the beleaguered sector’s support. It gave around $223,000 in support of Trump, compared with none for his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, according to a Reuters analysis.

Widespread abuse and exploitation of Asian and African migrant fishermen continues to plague the Irish fishing industry, according to evidence presented to the jobs committee of the Irish senate on Tuesday.

The committee is investigating a permit scheme introduced by the Irish government in response to a Guardian exposé of working conditions on its trawlers in 2015.

The scheme was meant to regularise the status and give employment rights to the large numbers of undocumented workers on whom the industry depends for labour. The International Transport Federation’s coordinator Ken Fleming told the committee however that the permits had not had the intended effect but had instead “legalised slavery” and were no better than “dog licences”.



“I’ve seen dogs treated better than what I’ve witnessed [among migrant fishermen] in the last two years,” Fleming said. The union told parliamentarians it had found widespread illegality on boats including non-payment of wages, poor uptake of permits, and cases of workers being trafficked. It is preparing to lodge legal claims against the Irish state for failure to tackle the problem.

The senator Ged Nash, who was jobs minister when the government set up an urgent taskforce to address the abuses identified by the Guardian investigation, told the committee that he was aware of “really egregious problems” in the Irish fishing industry. He described meeting 42 Egyptian migrant fishermen in his Drogheda constituency last year of whom only two had managed to obtain the new permits and said he had heard of “wilful abuse”. He condemned the enforcement agencies for failing to protect workers from illegal conditions, which he believed were putting the reputation of the whole industry at risk.

The Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland also gave evidence to the committee. Its director Edel McGinley said the centre was seeing “gross forms of exploitation” and called for an immediate review of the permit scheme. A survey by MRCI involving 30 in-depth interviews with non-EEA migrant fishermen in recent months found a third reporting routine verbal or physical abuse; 44% reporting personal injuries during work including serious cuts and crushed limbs; almost half saying they did not feel safe because of exhaustion from very long hours and prolonged lack of sleep, and two-thirds saying they regularly had to carry out unpaid work.

Two decades after the UK handed it back to China, President Xi Jinping is in Hong Kong for the first time to celebrate the anniversary. The ‘one country, two systems’ principle was designed to preserve democratic freedoms in the wealthy former colony. After troubled years of protest at the perceived erosion of those rights, the Guardian meets young Hong Kong citizens struggling to afford property, those moving abroad for opportunities, leaders of the pro-democracy umbrella movement and movers in the pro-Beijing establishment

Xi Jinping tells reporters he wants to ‘map out the future’ on three-day trip that coincides with 20th anniversary of handover by British

The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has vowed to bring “new glory” to Hong Kong at the start of a highly sensitive three-day tour of the former British colony designed to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its return to China.



In a brief speech after landing at Hong Kong’s international airport on Thursday morning, the Communist party chief said he had come to “map out the future” of this semi-autonomous city of 7.3 million citizens.

“I’m pleased to have set foot in Hong Kong once again … Hong Kong has always been in my heart,” said China’s authoritarian leader, whose almost five years in power have coincided with the most politically volatile period in the city’s post-handover history.

Xi’s rare “inspection tour” – his first to Hong Kong since becoming China’s top leader in late 2012 – has been timed to coincide with celebrations of two decades since it was handed back to China, on 1 July 1997, after more than 150 years of British colonial rule.

Huge crowds are expected on Saturday, with mass pro-democracy demonstrations and a 23-minute pro-Beijing firework display over Victoria Harbour planned.

Swaths of the city have been placed under an unprecedented security lockdown, with military helicopters buzzing through the skies and about 11,000 police officers – more than a third of the city’s force – being deployed in an attempt to shelter Xi from the protesters.

The area surrounding Xi’s hotel, the Grand Hyatt, and the Hong Kong convention and exhibition centre, where the main handover anniversary ceremony will take place, have been isolated and surrounded by two-metre high water-filled barriers.

Speaking after his arrival, Xi said the celebrations of Hong Kong’s return to the “motherland” represented “a happy occasion for the country as well as for Hong Kong”. “I wholeheartedly wish Hong Kong will create a brighter future,” he added.

Boris Johnson, the UK’s foreign secretary, said the anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to Chinese control rule was “a moment to reflect on Hong Kong’s immense achievements as a thriving and dynamic city, serving as a gateway to the biggest and fastest-growing markets in the world”.

He added: “The rule of law, an independent judiciary, and a free media have all been central to Hong Kong’s success. As we look to the future, Britain hopes that Hong Kong will make more progress towards a fully democratic and accountable system of government.”

However, activists and protest leaders – some of whom were arrested on the eve of Xi’s arrival – said the presidential visit came at a bleak time.



“Demosisto, a political party founded after the 2014 umbrella protests by campaigners including Joshua Wong, tweeted:

Demosistō 香港眾志 (@demosisto) Right across this celebratory skyscraper, we sit peacefully to tell the world: There’s nothing to celebrate. #HongKong is dying. pic.twitter.com/SW9dkNSia0

On Wednesday night protesters, including Wong, were arrested after storming a statue outside the building where Xi is expected to give a speech, unfurling banners calling for the release of Nobel peace prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, who was recently diagnosed with terminal liver cancer while in prison.

Under the “one country, two systems” formula agreed between Britain and China before handover, Hong Kong continues to enjoy far greater political freedoms than the authoritarian mainland, where a crackdown is under way.



However, activists say Xi’s reign has seen intensified efforts to thwart Hong Kong’s push for democracy as well as a growing erosion of the freedoms guaranteed to its citizens. The recent abduction of a group of local booksellers and the ousting of two democratically elected pro-independence lawmakers from Hong Kong’s parliament have reinforced fears that the city’s way of life is under siege.

“When democracy is not in sight, we need to take action to confront this system,” the Wong reportedly shouted as he was dragged into custody.

Martin Lee, a veteran democracy campaigner, urged Xi to use his visit to announce bold steps to win back the increasingly disillusioned hearts and minds of Hong Kong’s citizens, and particularly its youth. However, Lee, 79, said he feared Xi would spurn what was a “golden opportunity” to extend an olive branch to Hong Kong’s democracy movement.

“It’s so sad,” he told the Guardian. “If Xi Jinping doesn’t reverse the direction they are going in … then Hong Kong will soon become just another Chinese city – very quickly. There would be no dissent … no Joshua Wongs. That would be depressing. Hong Kong would not be Hong Kong.”

Reporters had limited access to Xi’s activities on his first day in Hong Kong but the president was reported to have met top local politicians, including outgoing chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, and his successor, Carrie Lam, visited an arts hub and been serenaded by two young Cantonese opera singers.



Jason Ng, a Hong Kong based author who has written a book about its young protest generation, said he expected Xi would be “wrapped in a bubble several blocks wide” during his stay. “He is being taken on a North Korea-style, highly controlled, completely contrived tour of Hong Kong where everything is rosy and every Hong Kong citizen adores Xi and loves China.”

But Ng predicted that Xi would find it impossible to isolate himself from dissenting voices, with democracy activists planning a “mini-occupation” to welcome China’s leader.



“By marching we hope to send him the message that he is not seeing the real Hong Kong,” Ng said.

If Pyongyang’s claim to have successfully launched an intercontinental ballistic missile is confirmed, the regime would be closer to having the ability to strike the US mainland. We take a look back at North Korea’s nuclear dynasty and ask: could the country trigger a nuclear war?

• North Korea claims successful test of intercontinental ballistic missile

If claim of ICBM launch is confirmed, it could move regime closer to being able to strike US mainland

North Korea claims to have conducted its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) , a development that, if confirmed, could move the regime closer to being able to strike the US mainland and dramatically strengthen its hand in negotiations with Washington.

South Korean and Japanese officials said they were studying the data to confirm whether or not it was an ICBM, but analysts said it appeared the missile had the range to strike Alaska but not other parts of the continental US.

Later there were reports in the US that officials believe North Korea may have fired its first intercontinental missile, though there was no official public statement from the US about this.

The launch, which came as Americans prepared to mark Independence Day, triggered a Twitter outburst from President Donald Trump who urged China to act to “end this nonsense once and for all”.

In a joint statement released after the missile test, Russia and China condemned the launch and proposed that North Korea declare a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests, while at the same time calling on Washington to immediately halt deployment of its THAAD anti-missile system in South Korea.

In a rare announcement on state North Korean television, an emotional newsreader said Kim Jong-un had personally overseen the “landmark” test of a Hwasong-14 missile.

North Korea was now a “a strong nuclear power state” and had “a very powerful ICBM that can strike any place in the world,” the newsreader said.

She added that the missile had reached an altitude of 2,802km (1,741 miles) and flew 933km (580 miles) – longer and higher than any of the regime’s previous similar tests. Those figures roughly concurred with analysis by Japanese and South Korean officials.

Early indications were that the missile was a single-stage device.



But later, NBC News cited two unnamed US officials saying they now believed it was “two stage”, and CNN quoted one official saying it was a “probable” ICBM and that the ongoing assessment suggested a second-stage booster did ignite and produced additional flight for 30 seconds.



While the apparent advancement in North Korea’s missile technology will add to concerns that the regime is moving closer to developing the capacity to strike the US mainland, many analysts still doubt whether it can miniaturise a nuclear weapon sufficiently to fit it on to a missile. They also believe the regime is unlikely to have mastered the technology needed for an ICBM to survive re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere.

South Korea’s military confirmed that North Korea had fired an “unidentified ballistic missile” into the Sea of Japan – known in North Korea as the East Sea of Korea – from Banghyon in North Pyongan, a province near its border with China.

The timing of North Korea’s 11th launch this year – on the eve of the US Independence Day holiday and just before the start of the G20 summit in Hamburg – was significant. It came soon after Donald Trump met the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, in Washington, and held telephone discussions dominated by Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear weapons programmes with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe.

The missile landed in Japan’s exclusive economic zone, the South Korean military and Japanese government said.

Tokyo strongly protested against what it called a clear violation of UN resolutions banning Pyongyang from developing ballistic missile technology.

The US Pacific Command said it detected and tracked the “single launch of a land-based, intermediate-range ballistic missile” for 37 minutes near an airfield in Panghyon, about 60 miles north-west of Pyongyang - a flight time longer than any similar previous tests.

The joint statement from Russia and China, issued shortly after President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping held wide-ranging talks in the Kremlin, called on North Korea, South Korea and the United States to sign up to a Chinese de-escalation plan designed to defuse tensions around Pyongyang’s missile programme.

The plan would see North Korea suspend its ballistic missile programme and the United States and South Korea simultaneously call a moratorium on large-scale missile exercises, both moves aimed at paving the way for multilateral talks.

“The situation in the region affects the national interests of both countries,” the joint statement said. “Russia and China will work in close coordination to advance a solution to the complex problem of the Korean Peninsula in every possible way.”

The joint declaration also called on Washington to immediately halt deployment of its THAAD anti-missile system in South Korea, a move Washington says is necessitated by the North Korean missile threat. The statement said Washington was using North Korea as a pretext to expand its military infrastructure in Asia and risked upsetting the strategic balance of power in the area.

On Monday China’s ambassador to the United Nations had warned of “disastrous” consequences if world powers fail to find a way to ease tensions with North Korea that risked getting “out of control”.

North Korea has increased the frequency of tests this year as it attempts to develop a missile capable of carrying a miniaturised nuclear warhead as far as the US mainland – a geopolitical game-changer that Trump has vowed “won’t happen”.

The regime’s most recent missile test before Tuesday came on 8 June when it launched a new type of cruise missile that Pyongyang said was capable of striking US and South Korean warships “at will”.

David Wright, co-director of the Global Security Program at the US-based Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a blogpost the initial assessments of the flight time and distance suggested the missile fired on Tuesday could have a maximum range of roughly 6,700km (4,160 miles). “That range would not be enough to reach the lower 48 states or the large islands of Hawaii, but would allow it to reach all of Alaska,” he said.

Shea Cotton, a researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in the US, suggested the launch was deliberately timed to coincide with the anniversary of the US declaration of independence. “It’s already 4th of July in North Korea,” he said on Twitter. “I somewhat suspect they’re shooting off some fireworks today specifically because of that.”

South Korea’s joint chiefs of staff immediately briefed Moon. Since taking office on 10 May, Moon has tried to push cautious engagement with Pyongyang, but the regime has continued its missile tests, insisting it has the right to develop a nuclear deterrent to counter what it calls growing military provocations by the US.

Trump and Moon agreed to apply “maximum pressure” to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, but agreed they were open to dialogue with the regime “under the right circumstances”.

Trump declared the US had run out of patience with North Korea over its weapons programme. “Together, we are facing the threat of the reckless and brutal regime in North Korea,” he said. “The nuclear and ballistic missile programs of that regime require a determined response.”

Austin, Nashville and New Orleans have thrived on the success of vibrant music scenes. But as rents rise and noise complaints become more common, do they risk ruining what made them famous in the first place?

At a Sixth Street bar in the heart of Austin, Texas a pop up version of Seb’s jazz club from the Hollywood hit film La La Land is being set up – its blue letters yet to be switched on. Nearby, a replica of Breaking Bad’s Los Pollos Hermanos fast food restaurant has appeared, causing a minor Twitter frenzy.

These are just two of the attractions materialising in the city in time for the music and media festival South by Southwest (SXSW), and throughout the 10 days of the event it is hard to find someone who isn’t wearing an official SXSW wristband worth $1,000.



What started 30 years ago as a celebration of Austin’s local music scene, though, is now in danger of harming the very thing that made it unique. SXSW brings in hundreds of artists from around the world, 200,000 visitors and $325.3m (£250m) to the city’s economy. Its success has helped Austin establish music as a fundamental part of its development, but at the same time, as many as 20% of musicians in this self-appointed “live music capital of the world” survive below the federal poverty line.

When you become the hot cool city that everybody’s moving to, some of that freedom can get pushed out Hayes Carll

According to a recent study by the Urban Land Institute, the city is “in the effective ‘11th hour’ of the endangerment of the live music scene”, brought on by Austin’s rapid growth – it is now the fastest growing city in the US in terms of population, jobs and economy.

It’s a difficult reality for the city to confront. Austin is one of the three major US “music cities”, alongside New Orleans and Nashville, that have capitalised on this local culture at the risk of ruining the scenes that made them famous in the first place. In Austin, the local live music scene is now paying the price for its success. Brian Block, of the city’s economic development office, says despite an apparent city-wide financial boom, local musicians’ income is “at best stagnating, and possibly declining”.

Hayes Carll, a 41-year-old Grammy-nominated artist who recently won Austin’s Musician of the Year, says that for most Texans, Austin is “the mecca of music cities”. It was where it “all came together: the songs, the record stores, the community, the identity. It was the first place I went where I could say I’m a singer-songwriter and they didn’t ask me what my real job was.”

Music lives throughout Austin’s 200 or so venues, the annual music awards and festivals, and the many brilliant artists including Townes Van Zandt and Janis Joplin who have called it home. It was where Willie Nelson allegedly reunited the hippies and rednecks when he first went on stage at the Armadillo World Headquarters in August 1972. Today, Austin’s love of local creativity is immortalised in folk singer Daniel Johnston’s “Hi, how are you?” mural, depicting his iconic alien frog near the city’s university.

But despite this rich history, long-standing venues in Austin’s downtown Red River District are being forced to adjust to an influx of new neighbours – mostly expensive condos or hotels. Rising rents have forced venues like Holy Mountain and Red 7 to close, while noise complaints are an ongoing problem – hotels offer earplugs for a better night’s sleep.



“There’re some less than wonderful aspects to the growth process, and I know a lot of friends who have had to leave Austin,” says Carll, a Texan who has lived here for 12 years. “Austin is going to have to fight to keep some of the things that made it special – like the affordability and how you could be yourself and do whatever you wanted. When you become the hot cool city that everybody’s moving to, some of that freedom can get pushed out.”

The city government is keen to stress that they’re working to preserve the live music scene. In 2013 the Red River District was given its “cultural” title to highlight its local significance. Block says they are now implementing a Red River extended hours pilot programme in the hope that an extra hour of live music on the weekend will bring increased revenues to help cope with rising costs, and more paid work for the musicians.

The city is also revising its land development codes for the first time in 30 years in an effort to raise the profile of entertainment districts. There are other support systems that come from outside government too, such as Haam – which provides access to affordable healthcare for low-income musicians. “Music is very important to the culture, to the local economy – and I think it will remain so. Hopefully we can get ahead of the issues we know are coming,” Block says.

But some feel it’s too late. “I’m worried Austin will change negatively,” says Carll. “It’s great that Austin’s identity revolves around music, and that the city government is trying to do things to correct it. But none of that will matter if musicians can’t afford to live there, or the venues are shut down because of noise complaints, or you can’t get to the venue because you’re stuck in traffic on the highway.”

New Orleans: music from cradle to grave

Across the state border in Louisiana, New Orleans is facing similar problems as it develops and gentrifies. There are fears that without local government actively supporting musicians, the scene’s survival could be at risk.

“How do you keep a [music scene] real and authentic and yet encourage people to get involved? It’s a paradox,” says Jan Ramsey, editor of local magazine OffBeat. “There’s an authenticity to the music and the people who make it, and the integration of black and white culture here – we never want to lose that.”

John Swenson, journalist and author of New Atlantis, Musicians Battle for the Survival of New Orleans says the music “accompanies you from the cradle to the grave; it’s born out of the neighbourhoods” and permeates all levels of society. Jazz was born here, tracing back to the mixture of African drums and European horns played by slaves in the late 19th century; and part of its musical heritage is a long list of prodigious artists, from Louis Armstrong to James Booker.

This culture attracts some 10 million tourists to the city each year. But what is so unique about it – and gives the scene greater strength – is how it has become an invaluable lifeline for the city’s regeneration after the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

In the Spotted Cat, one of the long-standing venues on Frenchman Street, manager Cheryl Abana talks quietly as a jazz singer performs to a crowded room. “For a couple of years [after Katrina] it was pretty sad here and the music scene really helped out with trying to get everyone’s spirits up. It really helped build the city up again,” she says.

One of the most successful programmes to support the creative community following Katrina was Musicians’ Village, devised by Harry Connick Jr and Branford Marsalis alongside Habitat for Humanity. Situated in the Upper Ninth ward – one of the places hardest hit by the hurricane – it is a community of homes built by volunteers to support displaced musicians. “It’s a symbol to musicians that my community will be there when I get back; we’re going to keep that tradition alive,” says Jim Pate, executive director of the New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity.

A decade on, and artists of all genres and ages live in the village, including some of the godfathers of New Orleans heritage like Little Freddie King. “The musicians came back to New Orleans because music lived here,” says Swenson.

Nashville: the original music city

In Nashville, Tennessee, just a few blocks away from the famous honky tonk highway of Broadway, mayor Megan Barry sits in her office overlooking the state capitol. She is surrounded by motifs of Nashville’s music history: there’s a framed photograph of DeFord Bailey sitting on the steps of the Ryman auditorium, the first African American to perform at the Grand Ole Opry; and in the foyer hangs a painting by Chris Coleman of Kings of Leon. He gave it to Barry as a gift.

Music is everywhere. Although it has a heritage as influential as New Orleans, here it spreads further: from inside the mayor’s office and the government’s music council, to pretty much everyone you meet in the city who either plays it, writes it or listens to it (every taxi driver I meet is a musician; my Airbnb host is a songwriter).

As soon as I mention the phrase “music cities”, Barry interrupts jovially: “Well, I think there’s only one!” Music has been part of Nashville’s foundations since the 1800s when it established itself as a centre for music publishing. Its heritage goes back to the Fisk Jubilee Singers who were based here – the African American a cappella band who were the first musical group to tour the world, raising money for freed slaves. Upon hearing them, Queen Victoria allegedly coined Nashville’s title as a “music city”, which is now plastered across Tennessee billboards.

In 1925, WSM radio station was founded, which went on to broadcast the Grand Ole Opry – now the longest running radio show in the US that gave rise to some of the greatest names in country music. Music Row, the 200-acre area near downtown at its peak housed 270 music publishers, 120 record production agencies, 80 record manufacturing companies, 80 booking agencies and more. Elvis’ Heartbreak Hotel was recorded here at RCA in 1956; Bob Dylan’s Blonde on Blonde was recorded nearby at Columbia Recording studios 10 years later.

Now, the $10bn industry music industry provides 56,000 jobs, supporting more than $3.2bn of labour income annually. “We can’t undersell its importance to our overall economic viability and continued growth and prosperity,” says Barry.

Nashville is projected to grow by 186,000 residents and 326,000 jobs in the next 25 years, and like Austin, has to confront uncomfortable growing pains in the form of gentrification. But music is firmly intertwined with the city’s municipal plans for how it will develop in the future.

The city provides affordable housing for musicians, and music programmes for school children, as “we know our graduation rates go up when kids are involved in music,” says Barry. “They go on and they have a career in music and then it feeds the job creation. It’s about feeding that pipeline.

“I think that although music evolves and changes, the ability for Nashville to grow and change with it has been part of our success.”

At Dino’s bar in east Nashville, 26-year-old musician Cale Tyson is sipping on a beer. He is one of thousands of artists who moved here because of its history. “I feel like Nashville’s a town where musicians are treated really well. I don’t think anything’s closed off here,” says the Texan singer-songwriter. “In Nashville the competition and being around so many good artists forces you to work a lot harder.”

People continue to migrate to Nashville because of this (about 100 a day), and this influx has inevitably changed the music scene – for better or worse. The country music capital of the world – which ignited the careers of Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Loretta Lynn and Kitty Wells to name just a few – is now home to a burgeoning hip hop scene in the city’s so-called DIY clubs. Jack White moved in and set up a branch of Third Man records in 2009, while bands like Paramore, Kings of Leon and the Black Keys have all migrated here.

Nashville has even spawned a genre called “bro country”, where burly men sing about chewing tobacco and celebrate being a redneck (with lyrics that repeat “red red red red redneck”), their odd rap verses a world away from the original country music that formed the soul of this city.

But the commercialisation of Nashville has led to accusations that country music is “dead”. A few years ago US country singer Collin Raye made a heartfelt plea for the city to get back to its roots and remember the musicians who “built and sustained the Nashville industry and truly made country music an American art form,” he said. “It needs to be that way once again. God Bless Hank Williams. God Bless George Jones.”

And people are still trying to keep this alive. “I don’t think traditional country went away,” says Brendan Malone who runs a traditional honky tonk – an event celebrating country music – in the east of the city. “The fire was still kindling. It just needed to have some gasoline poured on it.”

At Malone’s Honky Tonk Tuesdays, a man in a check shirt is barbecuing some ribs in the car park of the US army veteran’s club. Inside, ageing regulars sit at the bar nursing whiskeys to the sound of Hank Williams on the juke box.

In the main room, men and women of all ages wearing Stetsons and western shirts take turns two-stepping with each other as the band covers songs of Ernest Tubb and Red Foley. They perform against a backdrop of the US flag laid out in fairy lights.

There’s a sincere sense of pride in Nashville’s history here, despite how far the city and its culture has changed. With support from the mayor’s office to the local community, it seems Nashville took a bet on music and it paid off.

He’s not named, but the leader of the free world looks uncannily familiar in this engaging and morally serious thriller that wrestles with contemporary American politics

Since the second world war, numerous professors of ethics or theology and several science fiction writers have fretted over the question of whether a seer or time-traveller, knowing what Adolf Hitler would go on to do, could be justified in killing him as a preventative measure. Stephen King fictionalised this dilemma in his 1979 novel The Dead Zone, in which a man sees that a rising populist politician will become an American Hitler, and agonises about whether assassination would be a patriotic act.

Now Guardian journalist Jonathan Freedland, after publishing 2015’s The Third Woman under his own name, has re-Bourne the pseudonym under which he previously produced five conspiracy thrillers. In To Kill the President, a White House legal aide spots a plot to murder a recently elected controversialist president who, though never named, seems familiar.

The end of the pseudonym: why I’m killing off thriller writer Sam Bourne Read more

Unexpectedly winning an election against a female Democrat who attracted criticism for being unwise with her email service, this “cheat and bigot” has dismayed the political and media establishments with “the tweets, the lies, the grotesque misconduct, the acts of unwarranted aggression”. He also does things of which Donald Trump has not yet been accused, including grabbing a female aide by her genitals in the Situation Room, where staff have been summoned in the middle of the night because the President wishes to nuke North Korea and China.

Although Armageddon is averted in the opening chapter, the fear that the leader intends to use cruise missiles as a sort of super-Twitter leads more moderate American patriots to seek out a Lee Harvey Oswald of our days. The conspiracy is spotted by Maggie Costello, an Irish-born diplomat who featured in Bourne’s The Last Testament (2007) and The Chosen One (2010).

Maggie is a liberal leftover from the previous presidency (by implication, the Obama administration) who has remained in post in the hope of moderating the new guy and also because she considers herself responsible – through a secret concealed until the final pages – for the election of the demagogic incompetent. Now hating herself for serving a man she believes should not be in power, she could solve private and public crises by failing to thwart the gunman.

Although President Trump is now viewed as an extreme test-case for this dilemma, the previous Republican president received similar fictional treatment: in Nicholson Baker’s 2004 novel Checkpoint, two men discuss whether there might be justifications for assassinating the then commander-in-chief. Fantasies about the possible shooting of real politicians are a recognised sub-genre of suspense fiction: Frederick Forsyth’s The Day of the Jackal (1971) dramatised a plot against President Charles de Gaulle of France, while Jeffrey Archer’s Shall We Tell the President? (1977), in its first editions, allowed Edward Kennedy to reach the Oval Office, as he never did in life, but put him at risk of sharing the fate of JFK.

The fact that Archer, after objections led by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, rewrote the novel with a fictional politician in the rifle-sights shows that what-if assassination plots, as well as debating ethical dilemmas, also raise them. A fascinating aspect of gunman narratives is that the reader is tempted to become complicit. Because failure of the assassination attempt would be an anticlimax of the sort deadly to a suspense story, readers of The Day of the Jackal found themselves guiltily wanting De Gaulle to be shot. At least in that case the French leader was already dead of natural causes; the target in Bourne’s novel is a living politician whom very many would prefer not to be in office.

Even committed Trump-haters may suffer struggles of conscience over what would count as a satisfactory resolution of the plot. The writer surely intends to induce such unease, and the clever denouement adds at least two more alarming paths to the moral maze the book has mapped. To Kill the President is a techno-thriller, with particular attention to remote inter-activity that allows the owner of devices and vehicles to control them from afar, but opens up the possibility of hackers intervening, Set-pieces include a terrific car-chase involving only one driver, and a plotline that may leave readers paranoid about the central-heating thermostat. The story also incorporates flashbacks to Iceland, India, Namibia and Norfolk that imaginatively fatten the narrative.

Unusually, it is explicitly a feminist thriller. Not only the off-stage President but also two of the major male characters are revoltingly misogynistic, while Maggie’s quandary about whether to stop her boss being shot is complicated by her knowledge of young women who have suffered from his tolerance of sexual harassment and intolerance of abortion.

As President Trump’s worldview also includes the declared belief that novels are pointless, he seems unlikely to read the book, although might perhaps tweet his outrage that it is premised on his potential violent death. If he opened it – and showed more mature reflection than he has on other topics – he would find a pacy, engaging and morally serious thriller that offers no easy answers on the limits of loyalty and dissent within a democracy.

The Guardian’s own Jonathan Freedland has written five effective, bestselling thrillers under the nom de plume Sam Bourne. Like its predecessors, the first under his own name inhabits a comfortable middle ground between Dan Brown and Robert Harris, and fans of arrestingly Orwellian opening sentences will enjoy the first line: “It was the last day of January and the New Year was approaching.”

Freedland means the Chinese New Year: in The Third Woman the US is in total economic (and, increasingly, cultural) thrall to China. To ensure interest payments are made on America’s debts, China has established a military presence, building garrisons at key ports along the west coast. The time frame is hazy, but we seem to be around 10 to 15 years into this occupation. Pollution is out of control but the rioting that occurred early on has given way to grudging tolerance, and in some spheres assimilation has been cordial.

Freedland has great fun building his conceptual exoskeleton. In this LA – one big Chinatown – Hollywood still makes films but all treatments are sent to Beijing for approval. The Chinese ruling elite fill the gossip columns; Mandarin slang peppers everyday speech; and one popular hangout is the Great Hall of the People, a restaurant styled like a Mao-era peasant farm “serving Chinese fusion – dim sum with Waldorf salad, roast duck served with fries – to couples and irony-chasing twentysomethings”.

Into this world Freedland introduces Los Angeles Times journalist Madison Webb. When her seemingly clean-living younger sister, Abigail, dies from a heroin overdose, Maddy suspects foul play. And her death turns out to be the third in a series of similar ritualised killings. Maddy’s investigations suggest Chinese involvement. So why is the LAPD in such a hurry to dismiss her theories as the ramblings of a grief-stricken flake?

The Third Woman was inspired, Freedland tells us, by Martin Jacques’s bestselling When China Rules the World, which argues that China has no interest in moving towards western-style democracy. Rather, its economic power will grow as it learns to operate “both within and outside the existing international system … sponsoring a new China-centric international system which will exist alongside the present system and probably slowly begin to usurp it”. With flair and insight, The Third Woman teases out the consequences of this usurpation. Jacques suggests, provocatively, that democracy is a “non-essential end” for China. I doubt Freedland would go this far, but a satirical subplot involving the California gubernatorial election shows American democracy at its most cynical and pantomimic.

While Maddy is mostly well drawn, there is something depressing about the obligatory passage every thriller with a female lead seems to have – I call them “But What Do Her Breasts Look Like?” scenes – in which she strips to examine herself in the mirror and is relieved to find herself trim and sexy, with “no obvious cellulite on her thighs, no dimpling of fat”. You won’t find Jack Reacher salivating over his own six-pack.

Two women whose brother was murdered after a hate campaign from his neighbours tell how they lost faith in the system

There were two moments in particular when Mojgan Khayatian realised that the racism faced by her brother, Bijan Ebrahimi, went beyond the crude bigotry of individuals to the callous indifference of institutions.

The first came in 2007, after Ebrahimi’s flat in Bristol was set on fire while he was still in it. He survived and the council moved him. But before he left the first flat his sister came over to help him clean it up.

“The police arrived, grabbed Bijan and without any explanation put handcuffs on him,” explains Khayatian. “They said: ‘Someone reported that you were breaking into the flat.’ I explained to them that we were cleaning up but they wouldn’t listen. They were arresting him and it was only when a council officer came and told them the same thing that they took off the cuffs. But they didn’t say sorry. They just went away. That’s when I realised there was something not normal happening.”

The second moment came a month after Ebrahimi was beaten to death by one of his neighbours and then set on fire in July 2013. That was when the family realised that this systemic negligence would continue beyond the the grave. Khayatian and her sister, Manizhah Moores, went to lay flowers outside the flat accompanied by two liaison officers. They were still in the dark about what had happened to their brother and why the liaison officers would not tell them.

Bristol city council faces inquiry over handling of Bijan Ebrahimi Read more

“When we emptied his storage cupboard we decided to give away the belongings that had no sentimental value,” explains Khayatian. “The liaison officers knew what had happened, but they allowed us to give his things to the people who were the actual cause of his murder. After we found out we were disgusted with ourselves. When I discovered that, I lost all my faith in the system and I knew more was coming.”

That realisation sparked a tireless campaign over four years by the two sisters both to find out what happened to their younger brother and to make sure that the world knew. Revelations along the way led to the jailing of one police officer and one community support officer for misconduct in public office and the dismissal of two other constables.

Earlier this week that campaign reached a milestone when the police watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) issued a report saying that the police repeatedly failed to protect Ebrahimi even as he constantly alerted them to the violent, racially-motivated hate campaign he endured at the hands of his neighbours.

Ebrahimi was the youngest of the family, who took care of his ailing parents in Tehran. When they died he sought refugee status in Britain and, after a brief stay in Leicester, went to Bristol to be near his sisters. Medical problems both with his knees and with his spine left him disabled.



“We were over the moon when he came here,” says Khayatian. “There was a guilt inside us because he had looked after our parents and even though he was the cleverest he hadn’t been to university. So we wanted to relieve ourselves of this guilt. It gave us an opportunity to look after him, to cook for him and wash his clothes. To really be there for him.”

The abuse Ebrahimi faced on the housing estate where he lived was unrelenting. Some harassment was relatively petty. He loved his tabby cat, Mooshi, so they kicked it. He adored his flowers and plants so the neighbour who led a vendetta against him encouraged children to vandalise them. But some was far more serious.



They spread a rumour that he was a paedophile, threatened to run him over and threw rocks at his doors. A few days before he murdered Ebrahimi Lee James barged into his house and beat him up on the pretext that Ebrahimi was taking pictures of his daughters. Over six years Ebrahimi called the police 85 times.

“I only knew one in 10 things that happened to him there,” says Khayatian. “He tried to make sure I didn’t worry.”

But what came to light during the investigation was the degree to which both the police and the council chose to ignore his pleas or believed other tenants instead of him. In 2009 police described him as “a serial complainer about his neighbours and investigations always reveal informant to be the aggressor”. The day James burst into his house and headbutted him, Ebrahimi was arrested for breach of the peace.

It was this systemic, institutional neglect that the sisters took on. They also named it for what it was: racism – a term most official reports have shied away from, referring instead to an unspecified “hate crime”. In her foreword the IPPC commissioner, Jan Williams, writes: “Some of the evidence has the hallmarks of what could be construed as racial bias, conscious or unconscious.”

In a previously sealed consent order, seen by the Guardian, the chief constable of Avon and Somerset constabulary admits to both a breach of Ebrahimi’s rights under article two of the European convention on human rights for failing to protect his life, and a breach of his right not to be discriminated against on the grounds of race.

“Bijan was left defenceless against the race hatred of other tenants because the very institutions whose duty it was to protect him are infected with the same racism,” said Tony Murphy of Bhatt Murphy solicitors, which acted for the family.

They got this far, says Moores, because the authorities originally misjudged them. “They thought these two sisters were going to be fobbed off with a few words. We were not the foreigners that they thought. Maybe we can tell them what to believe and they will go away. But we fought for this. We were there all the time. Every meeting they asked us to go to. We read every report.”

And it’s not over. The sisters claim the council also failed Ebrahimi and they are calling it to account too. “The main reason the police thought this was because the council said that Bijan was the troublemaker,” explains Moores. “They could have moved him to a better place. But they blamed him for the trouble because he wasn’t white.”

“We knew their action was pure racism,” says Khayatian. “And that encouraged us to fight for it.”

Bristol’s elected mayor, Marvin Rees, said this was “a horrific case which highlighted the need for many things to change”. He said the city council was “very sorry for any shortcomings that are identified”.



Bijan Ebrahimi was always a persistent younger brother, says Khayatian. “If we were playing some kind of game, and he thought he had the right answer, he was the kind of boy who would have continued researching more, to prove his point. He was very determined. If he believed something was right. He would stand by it. Everything that happened to him did make him more withdrawn but he never lost his spirit.”

It is this tenacity that comes through when reading the official reports. That somehow, even as the neighbours abused him, the police force either neglected or targeted him, and the council maligned him, he continued to insist both on his humanity and his rights.

In her foreword, Williams notes: “The most salutary lesson for the constabulary is underlined by the sad poignant fact that Bijan Ebrahimi kept faith with the police throughout. The Avon and Somerset constabulary misconduct panel noted that he remained respectful, cooperative and calm, if at times tearful. He was persistent in arguing his case, but nevertheless polite. Under extreme stress and provocation, at no point did he descend to profanity, to insult, to abuse. He never ceded dignity.”

However many remasterings of the records there are, however many dramas, documentaries and memoirs of their life and times, it seems there will always be room for something more. The flood of material about the band will never slacken, because our appetite for it will never be sated.

I fell ravenously on In Their Lives, even if I did balk at the subtitle “Great Writers on Great Beatles Songs”. While nearly all of the 28 essays here feature great Beatles songs (let’s draw the line at “Yellow Submarine” and “Octopus’s Garden”) it’s a bit presumptuous to claim greatness for the other half of the equation. Charmed as I am by David Duchovny (“Dear Prudence”) I’m not sure he’s even a great actor, let alone a great writer. And Francine Prose (“Here Comes the Sun”) really lets the side down by including her nine-year-old granddaughter as co-author (“we’re all delighted that Emilia likes the Fab Four”). A few others here are too eager to share their generational bonding over the Beatles, though I did like the moment Ben Zimmer asked his son where he would look if he wanted to parse the lyrics of “I Am the Walrus”. His reply: “Goo goo ga Google”. Lennon would have laughed.

Editor Andrew Blauner perhaps encouraged this “me first” angle when he was rounding up his contributors. Several novelists – Jane Smiley, Joseph O’Neill, Mona Simpson, Elissa Schappell – choose a song essentially as a springboard to reminiscence. Rebecca Mead discusses “Eleanor Rigby” as the associative memory-link with the divorcing parents of a childhood friend, and so to the realisation that adults weren’t just there to provide “the untroubled backdrop to the dramas of children”. It’s nicely written, but its relevance is tenuous. The collection can be roughly divided between two types of essay: “What the Beatles meant to me”, and “Why the Beatles’s songs were great”. I much prefer the second type, because they are specific and analytical, whereas the my-life-was-never-the-same-again riff might have been triggered by any sort of musical madeleine.

The very best essays, of course, can do both. I loved Peter Blauner’s likening the first-note propulsion of “And Your Bird Can Sing” to a jet taking off, “firing on all cylinders”. He proceeds to examine precisely why it works, addressing the great and mysterious alchemy that transformed an unpromising demo one week into a two-minute masterpiece the next: “The foundation is still John’s on the final version, but it’s Paul joining George on the harmony guitar intro, giving a necessary touch of raw urgency to the part that Harrison had just played prettily the week before … He trims his vocal part, giving John enough room to state his case while chiming in strategically for just a few words at the end of each verse. And then he lays down that monster bass line, which Marshall Crenshaw compares to the crucial element in a Bach invention, the unnoticed piece that locks everything into place”. And there he might have left it, but instead he supplies a lovely coda about not visiting the Lennon memorial in Central Park for years, because “the real spirit of the man exists in a more private place. And I go there whenever I hear this glorious ode to being misunderstood”.

In essence the Beatles combined the catchiness of Tin Pan Alley songwriting with the raucousness and energy of rock’n’roll – and that was just the first half of their career. As Malcolm Gladwell once pointed out, they had 10,000 hours of live performance behind them before they even discovered what they could do in a studio. In the words of Jon Pareles, “they were pros who refused to become hacks”. Some kind of restlessness was goading them on, underpinned by an individual virtuosity that gave them the confidence to experiment. And as the music becomes more sui generis so the pronouncements on it become increasingly sonorous.

“Tomorrow Never Knows”, Pareles says, was “a portal to decades of music to come”. Alec Wilkinson reckons that “She Said She Said” describes “circumstances novel to western awareness and has no obvious antecedent or reference”. Adam Gopnik tops them both in arguing that the “Strawberry Fields Forever”/“Penny Lane” single was the most significant work of art in the 1960s, “the one that articulated the era’s hopes for a crossover of pop art and high intricacy” – for a little while “such music suggested that anything was possible”. They are not necessarily wrong, any of them.

I used to believe the Beatles 'belonged' to Liverpool. Time has told me otherwise

Others reach for literature as a means of exaltation. Nicholas Dawidoff in a brilliant essay describes “A Day in the Life” as “Ulysses in a pop song, the typical day made unforgettable”, and “In My Life” as “rock’s analog to Sonnet 116”. O’Neill recalls the more fanciful musings of Christopher Ricks on Bob Dylan when he likens “Good Day Sunshine” to a poem by John Donne, yet I found it hard to resist the song’s “cunningly suspenseful” bass opening compared to “a discus thrower’s windup”.

Certain contributions are plain cuckoo. Chuck Klosterman seems as confused as anyone else by his choice of “Helter Skelter” – “(maybe) the sixth-best song on their fifth-best album” and “the well-considered, capably executed, fully conscious manifestation of a bad idea”. But it’s perverse fun at least. I couldn’t understand why Pico Iyer writes about “Yesterday”, given his admission that the Beatles “have never been a group I’ve enjoyed”. Was he that desperate to accept the commission?

Books such as this have to be measured against Ian MacDonald’s peerless Revolution in the Head, not only the best ever book about the Beatles but probably the best ever book about rock music in general. He brought a musicologist’s erudition, a historian’s deep insight and a fan’s enthusiasm to the task of explaining why the band matters so much; it’s a book I consult on an almost daily basis. Only once, perhaps, does In Their Lives approach his greatness, when Rick Moody’s essay somehow melds the end of his parents’ marriage to the “The End” medley from Abbey Road. Composed in the last gasp of the 1960s, the medley marks what he sees as the band’s last hurrah, a togetherness in the midst of so much recrimination and mistrust, expressed in “the infamous Paul-George-John guitar showdown at the end of a long and winding career”. Moody nails it beautifully, right down to Harrison’s closing solo.

As a fan who knew the streets they walked and the pubs they drank in, I used to believe the Beatles “belonged” to Liverpool. Time has told me otherwise. John, Paul, George and Ringo of course belong to us all, “their apostolic names” (Moody) bandied around as if they were our own familiars. Most pop music withers in memory. They can’t be the same songs they were, because we aren’t the same people. But Beatles songs may grow old with you. Or as Shawn Colvin (“I’ll Be Back”) puts it: “I loved it when I heard it in 1965. I still do and I always will.”

As The X-Files returns, David Duchovny talks about feeling vulnerable, those Gillian Anderson rumours – and why he and his co-star should be paid the same

A small crowd has gathered in front of the Fox theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. Carrying rolled-up copies of Variety magazine and holding up mobile phone cameras, they press their flesh as close to the metal barricade as possible. They are here to see David Duchovny, most famous for the newly resurrected science-fiction drama The X-Files, whose star is being unveiled on the Walk of Fame today. Duchovny’s closest confidantes are here, too – X-Files creator Chris Carter, Californication co-star Pamela Adlon, his manager Melanie Green, his brother – but they’re outnumbered by the strangers, the autograph seekers, and the tourists who will stop anywhere they see a fence and some security guards in LA.

Duchovny is a recovering sex addict and a famously private man. During the ceremony that follows, his friend, the comedian Garry Shandling, refers to him as a “sensitive, vulnerable guy”. A few hours later, at a nearby hotel, I ask Duchovny if this is true. In his slow, laconic drawl, he says it is. “You know, Garry can stand there and tell you I’m this or I’m that,” he says, “but that’s not really the narrative that’s out there, and that’s OK.”

Duchovny’s hotel room is an ornate, whimsical pastiche of styles and patterns. The entire building reeks of a pungent perfume, as though the staff were covering up an even more heinous smell. It is a fitting location in which to discuss one of the more artificial, touristy traditions of Hollywood, one about which Duchovny seems ambivalent.

“You know, we live in an ironic age,” he says. “To hear Garry go up there in this quite probably cheesy ceremony from another time – you know, campy, kitschy, in a crappy part of Hollywood – it could be just awful. If you pull back a certain way, you want to just run. Listening there, I don’t know what Garry is going to say, and I hear him try to say heartfelt, loving things as a friend, and I’m like, ‘Yeah, he’s really trying to communicate, and that’s beautiful and ballsy.’ Because people are out of that habit. It’s so hostile the way we communicate socially now, and so ironic and so meta and distant and multilayered. To hear a guy go out there and say, ‘I love Dave.’ I felt exposed.”

Duchovny has spent a major part of his life being exposed. The 55-year-old has now been a globally recognised face since The X-Files premiered in 1993. That fame offers a variety of perks, but it’s also a burden for someone as seemingly introverted as Duchovny. His battle with sex addiction led him to check into a rehab facility in 2008, and his on-again, off-again marriage to fellow actor Téa Leoni, with whom he has two children, has made them both fodder for tabloid speculation. In 2008, he threatened to sue the Mail On Sunday over a story alleging he had an affair with a Hungarian tennis instructor, which both parties denied. The Mail on Sunday retracted the story. That aside, he retains a reputation as a bit of a playboy and there continues to exist a prurient public interest in his private affairs.

Gillian Anderson was the most notable no-show at Duchovny’s Walk of Fame event, but she did send a letter that was read aloud, a mock eulogy that ended with her jokingly saying, “He’ll always be my shining star. May his soul rest in peace.” As Agent Dana Scully, Anderson spent nine years and two motion pictures playing the foil to Duchovny’s dogged, obsessive Agent Mulder. Their fictional relationship developed from a tense partnership to a tortured romance, which in the new six-episode series has soured into a breakup. Their dynamic chemistry made fans campaign to see them together, both on screen and off. Rumours persist that Duchovny and Anderson have, at one point, been involved in a sexual relationship. (It doesn’t help that neither appears to be in a committed relationship, or aren’t letting on they are.)

There seems to be a Twitter contingent that wants Gillian and me to be together

That Duchovny still has to answer questions about their relationship visibly frustrates him. “Gillian and I are not lovers, or boyfriend and girlfriend,” he says. “There seems to be a certain kind of Twitter contingent that wants us to be together. It’s odd to me, because I’ve never had the fantasy of wanting two people together that aren’t, or are.”

We arrive at the subject of Anderson’s recent revelation that she was offered less than he was to do the new series. “I’ve done everything I can to help that whenever I could,” Duchovny says. “I think we should be paid the same to do The X-Files.” He rises in his chair to hammer home the point further. “You can ask Gillian. She knows that I have always wanted us to be paid the same, for as long as I’ve known there was a discrepancy. Hollywood payment is not fair, and it doesn’t always parcel on gender lines or race lines, or anything like that.”

In fact, Duchovny has had his own war over money with 20th Century Fox. His exit from the show in 2001 followed a lawsuit filed against Fox for allegedly underpaying him millions of dollars in ancillary profits. The suit was settled out of court and he returned to the role of Fox Mulder for the final episodes of the TV series, and a second feature film, 2008’s The X-Files: I Want to Believe.

In addition to the financial rewards, the new series has offered Duchovny the challenge of finding a way to take Fox Mulder into the next stage of his life, without rehashing what he’d done two decades earlier. “I think it’s just the acknowledgment that 20 years have passed, at least,” he explains, “and the opportunity as an actor to try to say, ‘I can’t play it the way I played it when I was 33 or 32, because that would be obscene and weird’. It’s like seeing a 95-year-old guy in a toupee, you know.”

Instead he wants Mulder to age gracefully, meeting the march of time head on, rather than clinging to the tricks he employed as a younger man. “We don’t have to change Mulder, but he’s going to keep getting older, if I get to play him. While one’s character doesn’t change, there are little adjustments we make unconsciously. As we learn, as we lose, as things fall away, as new things happen. So I thought, ‘Wow, what an opportunity.’ I can be Mulder 20 years later. He’s still going to be Mulder, but I’ve got to figure out what’s the difference.”

I ask Duchovny how he thinks he’s changed himself. Does he ever wish the rest of the world could understand him the way friends like Garry Shandling do? “The need to be truly known, I feel, is an intimate, interpersonal thing. The need to be truly known seems very weird. Who really needs their innermost self to be known by more than two or three or four people?”

But I want to know, I say: I’m here to know. Wouldn’t it be better just to let it all out?

“If I appear indifferent or aloof, it just really means that I’m vulnerable and that I’m afraid,” he says. “So, what I’m actually saying is that, when people say, ‘Well, I’m just like anybody else’, that’s actually true. Although it just sounds like bullshit coming out of my mouth. But all that’s just kind of fear in those moments where you’re completely out of control in a crowd, or being consumed in some mass way.”

But crowds come with the job. Like anyone who’s lived with fame as long as he has, Duchovny possesses a certain physical presence that comes from needing to be concerned with appearance on a semi-regular basis. For today’s festivities, he’s wearing sneakers, jeans, a black T-shirt and a leather chain with an elaborate silver charm at the end – an ensemble befitting a man seen as something of a rebellious bohemian, an image cemented by some of the roles he’s chosen. In the acclaimed TV drama Californication, he played a brilliant writer and rakish sex addict – a part some took to be autobiographical.

Duchovny’s early roles enhanced his image as a rebellious, offbeat figure. In the thriller Kalifornia, he played a graduate student researching serial killers who unknowingly shares a ride across the US with an actual serial killer (Brad Pitt) and his girlfriend (Juliette Lewis). For a while, it appeared that every project he signed up to would be just as transgressive – the erotic serial Red Shoe Diaries, Twin Peaks – but The X-Files changed everything. His face ended up on magazine covers, action figures, trading cards, and in the dirty minds of male and female admirers across the world.

After he left the show, two years before it finally ended, he made a run at leading man status. But his big swing at blockbuster filmmaking, the Ivan Reitman comedy Evolution, stalled at the box office. After that, he wrote and directed the indie drama House Of D, co-starring Robin Williams, but that also failed to make an impact.“I don’t take a lot of pleasure in being happy in my performance if the thing doesn’t work,” Duchovny says now. “If the thing works, I’m pretty happy. Then, I’m more or less happy about what I’m doing.”

What reallymakes him happy, then? In another life, he was a prep school kid who grew up in New York City, and later an Ivy League graduate studying under literary critic Harold Bloom and pursuing a PhD. On a lark, he auditioned for a commercial for Löwenbräu beer and got the job. By 1988, he’d secured a small role in the Mike Nichols film Working Girl and decided to make a go of acting. Since the end of Californication, he’s found time to publish a book – a talking animal fable called Holy Cow – and write another one. He’s released an album of soulful traditional rock and directed episodes of Californication and Bones. But, he tells me, it’s basketball that still has his heart.

I ask what position he played as an undergraduate at Princeton and Duchovny’s eyes light up. He shifts in his seat and smiles. “I was a guard, but I was a shooting guard.” In an Esquire profile dating back to the original run of The X-Files, he says the most memorable moment in his life occurred on the basketball court: a bit of last-minute heroics to secure a victory for his high-school team. “Is that shot still the highlight of your life?” I wonder. I see him transition back to seriousness in a flash, ready to correct me. “More accurately, it was a game-winning assist.”

For a man who just sat through a celebration of his career, Duchovny seems quite preoccupied with the unselfish nature of both basketball and acting. I can see that he really does take pride in having made the smart pass to win the game, and his language becomes more and more impassioned the deeper we get into sports talk. “I watch basketball,” he says, “and I hear those guys talk about themselves, and I just know who gets it and who doesn’t. And I’m like, ‘You will never win a championship. Oh, you might win a championship.’ Because basketball is a beautiful game. It’s not just about skill; it really is about understanding that team, whatever team you’re on. Every team’s got a different key.”

For now, he’s back with his original X-Files team, and having viewed the first two episodes, it’s clear that Fox Mulder has lost his faith. It’s as though more of Duchovny has seeped into his greatest creation. Mulder was a character defined by unwavering belief, but the actor who portrays him is sceptical of most things: strangers, social media, the very concept of fame.

“Mulder was always the engine and Scully was like the brake,” Duchovny says. “And now we had the guy who wasn’t putting his foot on the gas and she’s not putting her foot on the gas, either. I thought, ‘Well, where is the energy coming from?’ We had to get moving, and it was hard for me to try to figure out how to drive the show without being the guy who’s driving the show. I’m not sure if I succeeded.”

No one has publicly ruled out further adventures, and ratings in America have been quite good. But even if this is the end, Duchovny will still be busy. His Charles Manson drama Aquarius is coming back for a second series, and his next book, Bucky Fucking Dent, is scheduled for release later this year. It’s based on an unproduced screenplay that’s been sitting on his shelf for a few years, and returns to his love of sports, specifically baseball. “[The book] takes place in 1978 in New York, with the Yankee/Boston Red Sox pennant race as a backdrop. It’s not a baseball book, but it does use that as a backdrop. It’s a father-son story, with a love story thrown in as a curveball.”

I get asked, 'Are your kids proud of you?’ I don't understand that question. I don't care. I'm proud of them

And what of his own family? He has two children with Leoni – Madelaine West, 16, and Kyd Miller, 13. Duchovny and Leoni live five blocks apart from each other in New York, and co-parent. “You know, I get asked, ‘Are your kids proud of you?’, and I’m like, ‘I don’t understand that question. I don’t care. I’m proud of them. It’s reversed. I’m watching them. I couldn’t give a shit if they watch me.”

Duchovny sees himself as a bit of a teacher, a career both his mother and sister went into, and one he, too, considered before his leap into acting. He’s hoping to teach his children some of the endurance he has used to keep moving forward in showbusiness, in spite of lawsuits, divorces, tabloid scandals and unsatisfying projects.

“That’s what I worry about with my kids all the time. It’s not so much [a question of] are they going to win, but are they going to come back after failing? Are they going to get hurt too bad? You want them to remain vulnerable and real, so losing is going to hurt. Failing is going to hurt. But you really want to teach them somehow. I don’t know how, because you can’t just say, ‘Hey, be resilient.’ But I think if I look at my career and I look at myself, I’m pretty resilient and maybe that’s what that [Walk of Fame] star means to me: I can make it, and I kept at it. I kept trying.”

Still, it’s hard to shake the feeling that this entire day – the Walk of Fame, the interviews, the photos, even The X-Files – isn’t really who Duchovny is. So, what, if anything, does his new star on Hollywood Boulevard actually signify?

He pauses and sighs. “That nothing lasts for ever, but maybe this [star] will last for a while after I’m gone, and that’s kind of cool.” Duchovny smiles. “You know, you can come back here and step on me.”

• The X-Files starts on 8 February at 9pm on Channel 5.

When the art collector Peggy Guggenheim moved into her Venetian palazzo in 1949 she installed Marino Marini’s The Angel of the City on the landing stage. You can still see the bronze statue today. It depicts an ecstatic equestrian, body arched, erect phallus pointing urgently at the tourists as they putter up and down the Grand Canal. Guggenheim claimed in her memoir that she had instructed Marini to ensure that the figure’s phallus was detachable so that, should a huddle of sight-seeing nuns happen to pass by in a vaporetto, she could nip out, remove the offending organ, and spare everyone’s blushes.

This anecdote is the kind of thing from which Guggenheim’s biographers, of whom there have been many since her death in 1979, tend to avert their eyes, embarrassed at the way their subject always lets herself down at crucial moments by talking dirty. In any case, they ask, how feasible is this, really? Marini, like all artists, took himself deadly seriously and was hardly in the business of knocking up strap-ons for his masterworks. And Peggy Guggenheim, a highly sociable hostess with many calls on her time, is unlikely to have spent her days hovering by the palazzo windows on permanent nun-watch.

It is also thanks to anecdotes such as this that Guggenheim’s memoir, which she republished in different versions over a period of 30 years, received a critical drubbing when it first appeared in 1946. Stuffed with sexual scenes involving the smelting heiress’s reputed 400 lovers, including a hairdresser, a ski instructor, Samuel Beckett, Max Ernst and several gay men whom she took on as a challenge, Out of This Century appeared to be, in the words of a shuddering New York Times, “worthy of tabloid headlines and recounted in tabloid prose”. The Chicago Tribune, aghast at the “nymphomaniacal revelations”, suggested that a more accurate title would be “Out of My Head”.

What bothered the Tribune, the Times and a host of other newspapers was the way that the sleazy prattle of Out of This Century tarnished the reputation of the woman who had a legitimate claim to be one of the great heroines of 20th-century art. For without Guggenheim’s sharp eye, personal pluck and frenzied determination – as the Germans marched into Paris she embarked on a mission to save a painting a day – it is quite possible that seminal works by Brâncuşi, Klee, Mondrian, Magritte and Kandinsky would have disappeared in one of the Nazis bonfires of “degenerate” art.

Having escaped with her stash to New York by the skin of her teeth, Guggenheim then set about discovering a new generation producing a new kind of art. Motherwell, Rothko, De Kooning and, most famously, Pollock were the men who, gusted along by her enthusiasm and financial doles, would go on to create America’s first art movement of international importance, abstract expressionism.

Francine Prose is a novelist and literary critic rather than a professional biographer, which may be why she is unwilling to fall in with the general perception that Out of This Century is an appalling embarrassment. Not that Prose proposes reading the memoir, with its fudges and wild boasts, as a documentary account of her subject’s life. Rather, she suggests, it cements Guggenheim’s reputation as a creative artist in her own right. By quite consciously disregarding calendar time, flaunting the unreliability of her memory, and breaking the conventions about what a woman could and couldn’t say about her own life and body, Guggenheim produced a piece of modernist prose that exhibited the same daring and originality as the art she loved to collect. Out of This Century, for Prose, is a (nominally) non-fiction equivalent of Nightwood, the strange, dream-like novel written by Djuna Barnes while she was staying at Guggenheim’s 1930s boho hang-out in Devon, Hayford Hall (remembered fondly by its many guests as “Hangover Hall”).

Still, whether or not Guggenheim’s writing really was “almost as good as Gertrude Stein”, as Gore Vidal insisted, it will always be the art that matters. Peggy’s Uncle Solomon had got in first with his stodgily named “Gallery for Non-objective Painting” in midtown Manhattan, which meant that, right from the start, Peggy’s collecting career was braided with oedipal competition (her real father had gone down on the Titanic). Her first gallery, in Cork Street, London, was named “Guggenheim Jeune” to make the point that the work collected here was different (fresher) from that of Uncle Solomon and his prissily defined non-objectives. The opening show, curated by Marcel Duchamp, featured drawings by Jean Cocteau done on bedsheets. The second was a one-man show of Kandinsky, his first in Britain.

Returning to her native New York in 1941, Guggenheim opened her new museum/gallery hybrid on West 57th. The spectacular space, designed by Frederick Kiesler, aimed to offer what today we’d call a multisensory experience. The artworks appeared to hover in the air thanks to a system of pulleys, a locomotive seemed to be rushing through the room courtesy of an audacious sound system, and lights were set on timers to shine first on one part of the room and then another. Everyone, from Jean-Paul Sartre to Gypsy Rose Lee, came to gawp at the novelty, and the serious ones stayed for the art.

This excellent short biography appears in Yale’s “Jewish Lives” series, and Prose is a subtle and attentive chronicler of the antisemitism that operated in her subject’s life. The Guggenheims and the Seligmans (Peggy’s maternal family) worked assiduously to be more like white Anglo-Saxon Protestants than the Wasps themselves, careful never to remind anyone of their origins. Nevertheless, as Prose recounts with mounting indignation, whenever any of Guggenheim’s friends, lovers, husbands, artists or acquaintances were feeling cross with her, usually because she hadn’t immediately offered to pay for their children’s schooling, a return ticket to Europe, or their girlfriend’s new studio, they would automatically make jokes about her parsimony. In a novel by William Gerhardie, she appears barely disguised as Molly, “a rich American” who is apt to complain that she isn’t as rich as people think. And in “The Cicerone” by Molly McCarthy, who claimed to be a dear friend, she is “Polly Grabbe”, a wealthy, expatriate slut who collects statuary and always puts on her glasses to scrutinise the bill in restaurants. This was, at least, marginally less cruel than the many other “friends”, business associates, protegees and, shame to say, biographers, who could never resist drawing attention to the size of the Guggenheim nose.

Here is a horrendous Niagara of syrupy nonsense: sentimental, cliched and humourless.

Shirley MacLaine plays Harriet, a cantankerous and wealthy old dame who in the evening of her days decides to get someone to write her obituary, and bullies a local newspaper editor into letting one of his journalists into doing the job. This is Anne (Amanda Seyfried), and, like all movie journalists, Anne doesn’t seem to have much to do – except for this one extraordinarily labour intensive project that doesn’t seem to lead to anything in terms of words on paper or screen.

Of course, grumpy old Harriet turns out to be a marvel of life-affirming honesty and nonconformist integrity and she unlocks all Anne’s pent-up career frustration about wanting to be an essayist. Or something. But, even more adorably, and in the same defiant free-spirit mode, Harriet decides to mentor a local little girl, Brenda (Ann’Jewel Lee) who is African-American – like Harriet’s help. The condescension and cutesiness are unbearable.

Manchester international festival this year marked the centenary of the birth of one of the city’s most famous writers with a concert rather than a literary event. But then, Anthony Burgess once claimed that he thought of himself primarily as a composer who had drifted into writing books. He began composing at school, and continued to do so right to the end of life. He left more than 250 scores, covering almost every genre; they include a violin concerto for Yehudi Menuhin and a musical about Houdini intended for Orson Welles, as well as several symphonies.

Anthony Burgess: beyond A Clockwork Orange Read more

One of those works, Burgess’s Symphony in C, written in 1975, was performed for the first time in Europe in the BBC Philharmonic’s concert under Michael Francis. It was presented alongside the world premiere of The World Was Once All Miracle, a specially commissioned song cycle setting his words by Raymond Yiu, which was sung with his usual beauty of tone and immaculate attention to verbal detail by baritone Roderick Williams.

Yiu’s title comes from Burgess’s novel Earthly Powers, but the texts for his six songs are taken from the poem collection Revolutionary Sonnets. The song cycle is intended, Yiu says, as a portrait of the man himself, weaving in references to episodes in his life and his character. The third song evokes the sound of ceremonial music from Malaya, where Burgess lived in the 1950s and the last is an affectionate parody of a popular song from the 1920s, reflecting his love of Noël Coward and Cole Porter. It’s all done with Yiu’s typical light touch, but at times it seems he is so determined to illuminate Burgess’s personality as fully as possible that his own distinctive eclecticism recedes too far into the background.



Burgess’s own symphony, though, holds nothing back. It’s a sprawling four-movement affair very much following the classical model. It loses its way a couple of times but crowns the rowdy finale with a rather laconic setting for tenor and baritone (Williams joined by Robin Tritschler) of a passage from Love’s Labour’s Lost; one of the movement’s themes is a tune apparently written by Shakespeare himself for the play. There are echoes of between-the-wars British music, Vaughan Williams and Walton especially, but of Hindemith too. It’s perhaps not startling enough to create a clamour for lots more of Burgess’s music, but certainly worth hearing on its own terms in this anniversary year.

1. Yehudi Menuhin, born in New York City on April 22, 1916, was a US violinist, later also a conductor, teacher, impresario and supporter of human rights.

2. For the first 22 years of his life, his father falsified his birth date by nine months, presumably with the intention of making him seem even younger and thus even more of a prodigy.

3. Menuhin also had a Swiss passport, linked to his family’s 40 year residence in Gstaad.

4. In his late 60s Menuhin was also granted UK citizenship which enabled him to become Sir Yehudi. (He had been made an honorary KBE in 1965.) In 1993 he was named a life peer and took the title Lord Menuhin of Stoke d’Abernon, thus honouring the Surrey village where his international school for young musicians is situated.

5. His parents Moshe and Marutha were both born in Czarist Russia and came to the US separately after spending their childhoods in Palestine.

6. When he was four Yehudi was given a cheap violin made of tin but smashed the toy to the ground when he couldn’t make a beautiful sound on it.

7. His grandmother in Palestine sent sufficient cash for his father to buy an automobile for the family (a Chevrolet) and a real violin for Yehudi.

8. He and his sisters Hephzibah and Yaltah were educated at home by their parents and tutors. The girls, four and five years younger respectively, were both fine pianists, prompting a French professor to the observation that Mrs Menuhin’s womb was “a veritable conservatoire”.

9. Yehudi was an astonishing child prodigy. His family moved to California when he was an infant and he spent most of his first decade in San Francisco, where he studied first with the Austrian-born Sigmund Anker and then, aged seven, with Louis Persinger, a pupil of Eugene Ysaye.

10. On November 9, 1922, the six-year-old Yehudi played Accolay’s violin concerto in A minor at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium. This was his first public appearance.

11. In February 1923, he performed Charles de Beriot’s Concerto No. 9 “with the poise and temperament of a veteran” - according to the San Francisco Journal.

12. He gave his first full-length solo recital in 1925, aged eight at the Scottish Rite Auditorium, San Francisco, the programme included Mendelssohn’s violin concerto (with piano accompaniment).

13. The next year, aged nine, he made his New York recital debut, at the Manhattan Opera House.

To the exasperation of his father, he exchanged a silver-tipped violin bow for a month’s supply of wild strawberries.

14. The Menuhin family moved to Europe so that Yehudi could continue his studies with two of the world’s finest musicians: the Romanian George Enesco in Paris and the German Adolf Busch in Basel.

15. He made his Paris debut in 1927 when he was 10, playing concertos by Lalo and Tchaikovsky under the conductor Paul Paray.

16. In the summer of 1927 the Menuhin family went to Romania at Enesco’s invitation. Yehudi heard gypsy music for the first time. To the exasperation of his father, he exchanged a valuable silver-tipped violin bow for a month’s supply of wild strawberries from the gypsies.

17. He first played the Beethoven violin concerto at Carnegie Hall when he was 11; the orchestra was conducted by Fritz Busch.

18. In December 1928 he gave the world premiere of Abodah (“God’s Worship”) written especially for him by Ernest Bloch. This was the first of over 40 commissions and dedications; composers who wrote for him include Frank Martin, Andrzrej Panufnik and Malcolm Williamson.

19. In January 1929 he was given the $60,000 Stradivarius violin known as the Prince Khevenhueller (after its first owner).

20. At his Berlin debut in March 1929, aged 12, Yehudi performed a marathon concert consisting of three violin concertos: Bach’s in E Major and the Beethoven before the intermission and Brahms in the second half, with the final two movements of the Mendelssohn concerto played as an encore. The conductor Bruno Walter remembered the boy wonder: “he was a child and yet he was already a man and a great artist.”

21. In the Berlin audience in March 1929 was the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Albert Einstein. His reaction after the performance, as recorded by Moshe Menuhin: “My dear Yehudi, tonight you have taught me my first new lesson in many years...I have made a new discovery. I see that the day of miracles is not over...Our dear old Jehovah is still on the job.”

22. Yehudi was a plump boy despite taking regular exercise. His favourite post-concert relaxation was to eat strawberry ice cream with whipped cream on top.

23. He made his first gramophone recordings in 1928 for the RCA Victor company. On one side of the ten-inch 78 rpm disk was J.-H. Fiocco’s Allegro. On the other was La Capricciosa by Franz Ries. As a reward after his first recording session Yehudi was taken to see The Jazz Singer, starring Al Jolson, the very first talking picture.

Einstein was in the Berlin audience in 1929. I see that the day of miracles is not over, he said, after the concert.

24. During the Depression years Yehudi, now a teenager, switched his recording contract to His Master’s Voice; he stayed with that company for over 50 years.

25. In his teens, Menuhin was the world’s highest-paid musician and a friend of some of its greatest musicians including the conductor Arturo Toscanini and the composer Edward Elgar, whose violin concerto he recorded in 1932.

26. In 1938 all three Menuhin children got married within the space of three months. Yehudi, 22, married a beautiful Australian redhead, Nola Nicholson. Hephzibah married Nola’s sheep-farming brother Lindsay and went to live in Australia. Yaltah, only 16, married an American lawyer who turned out to be a homosexual; she was home again within six months.

27. Yehudi and Nola had two children, Zamira and Krov. Their marriage broke down during the second world war.

28. Pressured by Nola’s father the couple attempted a reconciliation when peace returned but they had irreconcilable personality differences.

29. In 1947 Yehudi Menuhin married Diana Gould, a former ballet dancer who had worked with Nijinkska, Massine and Ashton. They had two sons, Gerard and Jeremy. Like their father, the four children all had failed first marriages.

30. During the war Menuhin played for US troops all over North America including a tour of the Aleutian Islands and in Hawaii a series of concerts for wounded marines and for other combatants about to participate in the Battle of Guam.

34. In April 1945 he played for the inauguration of the United Nations General Assembly in San Francisco.

35. In June 1945 he screen-tested for the role of Niccolo Paganini in a British feature film entitled The Magic Bow. The part eventually went to Stewart Granger, but Menuhin recorded the film’s soundtrack.

36. Soon after the end of the war Menuhin travelled to the Belsen concentration camp to play for survivors of the holocaust and also for German civilians. His pianist was Benjamin Britten.

37. His tour of destroyed Germany concluded with a broadcast performance from Hamburg of the Mendelssohn violin concerto, the first time Germans had heard it since the banning of Mendelssohn’s music in 1933.

38. In November 1945 he flew to Moscow and forged a friendship with the great violinist David Oistrakh. He also visited Moscow’s Central School for gifted musical children which inspired the creation two decades later of his own international school in England.

39. In 1946-47 he actively campaigned for Wilhelm Furtwängler to be de-Nazified, giving concerts with him at the Salzburg and Lucerne festivals and later in Berlin.

40. In Berlin his recital for Jewish displaced persons was boycotted because of his support for Furtwängler. Next day he visited the nearby DP camp and made a compelling argument for reconciliation between victors and vanquished.

41. Within an hour of marrying Diana Gould at the Chelsea Registry Office in London on October 18 1947, Menuhin was at a concert rehearsal at the Royal Albert Hall, playing Paganini’s B Minor concerto.

42. In December 1947 Menuhin travelled to Hollywood to film a complete recital entitled Concert Magic. The worthy project of disseminating classical music in cinemas was doomed to commercial failure by the advent of television. Only two months later, in February 1948, Yehudi appeared in the first classical concert ever to be televised on the West Coast.

43. A film of Menuhin playing the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto dates from the same studio sessions. The Hollywood Symphony Orchestra was conducted by his Hungarian friend Antal Dorati.

44. In 1949, in Zurich, he gave the premiere of the Sonata for violin and piano which he had commissioned from William Walton. The pianist was Louis Kentner and the work was dedicated to the wives of the two musicians, Diana Menuhin and Grizelda Kentner, who were sisters.

45. In 1950 he made his first visit to Israel. He was greeted by bomb threats but went ahead with a series of public recitals partnered by his sister Hephzibah.

46. In 1950 he visited South Africa and spoke out against segregation. He insisted on playing for black audiences as well as white. He made a second visit in 1956 to appear at the Johannesburg Festival but did not return thereafter until the end of apartheid. In 1996 he conducted Handel’s Messiah with a black choir in a township outside Johannesburg.

In 1950 he visited South Africa and insisted on playing for black audiences as well as white.

47. In May 1951 Menuhin and his sister were entrusted with the first recital to be given in London’s new Royal Festival Hall.

48. While touring in New Zealand later in 1951 he read an article about yoga and decided to apply its relaxation method to his own violin playing.

49. He visited India for the first time in 1952, raising money for famine relief. He advertised for a yoga teacher and chose Mr B.K.S. Iyengar from Puna, who became a lifelong friend.

50. While in India he dined with the prime minister Pandit Nehru and demonstrated his newly acquired skill at yoga by standing on his head at the pre-dinner cocktail party. Mr Nehru responded in kind.

51. For eight years, from 1952 to 1960, he and his wife travelled by land and sea but not by air. This followed the deaths in air crashes of the noted violinists Jacques Thibaud and Ginette Neveu.

52. He was the first musician to play a solo concert in St Paul’s Cathedral, London, to an audience that included the Queen Mother.

53. He coached violin for the first time in 1954 when he was the guest professor at Nadia Boulanger’s summer school in Fontainebleau.

54. In 1957 he established his own festival in the Swiss resort town of Gstaad. Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears were the only guest artists.

55. The Menuhin family chalet, entitled “Chankly Bore” (a reference to the Jumblies by one of Diana’s favourite poets, Edward Lear), was ready for occupancy in 1960. Mr Iyengar was a regular visitor.

56. Having definitively quit California the Menuhins made their winter base for two winters in a villino (cottage) on the estate of the American art historian and dealer Bernard Berenson outside Florence.

57. In 1959 he assumed the artistic direction of the Bath Festival, which he ran for a decade, making many successful recordings with the Bath Festival Orchestra, later re-named the Menuhin Festival Orchestra.

58. The Menuhins moved to England in 1960, settling in a fine house in The Grove, Highgate.

59. For the last four decades of his life, Yehudi Menuhin became part of the English scene. He wrote many letters to The Times, appeared on the BBC Third Programme’s Brains Trust series and helped to found an organic food shop in central London.

He was one of the first Londoners to acquire an electrically-powered car.

60. Menuhin was an early supporter of green causes. He was one of the first Londoners to acquire an electrically-powered car. Passengers in the back seats had to get out and push when it was driven up Highgate Hill.

61. In 1962 he was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society.

62. In June 1963, at his Bath Festival, he played Bartók’s solo sonata for a new ballet, Serenade, by Kenneth Macmillan featuring Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev.

63. In September 1963 the Yehudi Menuhin International Music School opened in a former hotel in Kensington. The school moved the following year to its present premises in Stoke d’Abernon near Cobham, Surrey.

64. In 1965 the Queen bestowed an honorary knighthood (KBE) on Yehudi; because he was an American citizen he could not use the title.

There’s more to the Manchester author than bowler hats and ultraviolence. We take a look at Burgess’s diverse, prolific career in advance of two new films of his work screening at Manchester international festival

Alex from A Clockwork Orange is one of fiction’s indelible delinquents. The milk-sipping, bowler-hatted, ultraviolent droog has become an unlikely style icon for everyone from Usher to Kylie, while Bowie employed the book’s street-slang Nadsat on his final album Blackstar. In cinema, Reservoir Dogs and Heath Ledger’s Joker are just two examples that channel A Clockwork Orange’s uneasy scenes of gleeful menace.

His shopping list included 12 bottles of gin a week and he made his tea with five bags per cup

Stanley Kubrick’s vivid 1971 movie ensured A Clockwork Orange became a pop cultural touchstone, but its wildly inventive dystopia was all there in Anthony Burgess’s original novel, published in 1962. It’s the work Burgess remains best-known for, although he considered it an outlier in his prodigious career.

Born in 1917, John Anthony Burgess Wilson grew up above an off licence in Manchester’s Moss Side. His tobacconist father was also a pianist who’d once played with Charlie Chaplin; his mother was a singer who died of Spanish flu when he was just one year old. By his own account he was ignored by his boozing father and his stepmother, demonised in his Enderby novels. Despite these setbacks, he was reading Don Quixote at ten and composing modernist music at 13.

Anthony Burgess began writing poetry as an undergrad at Manchester University (six of his verses have been transformed into a song cycle for MIF by composer Raymond Yiu) but didn’t publish his first novel, Time for a Tiger, until he was 39. Gathering speed, he would go on to publish 32 more novels, plus several books on literature and linguistics, screenplays, music and superhuman quantities of reviews.

Burgess’s punishing schedule for fiction was 1000 words a day, seven days a week. Inside Mr Enderby was originally published under a pseudonym in case his breakneck output at the time – six novels in three years between 1959 and 61 – made him seem like a hack. Amazingly, he managed this with a shopping list that included 12 bottles of gin a week plus several bottles of wine for dinner with his first wife Lynne (her assault by American GIs in wartime London inspired A Clockwork Orange). He made his tea with five bags per cup.

Burgess distanced himself from Kubrick’s film of A Clockwork Orange, perplexed that this “very minor work” was the one people always wanted to know about. Yet its themes – rooted in his Catholic upbringing – of free will, sin and the wrong-headedness of forced reform, run throughout his life and work. Bucking received wisdom, not least the supposed link between high art and improvement of the soul, Alex is a Beethoven-loving thug. Enderby is the other side of the coin, a flatulent slob poet who pens his verse on the loo.

Burgess was enamoured enough with his own comic creation to bash out four Enderby novels between 1963 and 84. In celebration of Burgess’s centenary, Manchester international festival will premiere two new films by Graham Eatough and Stephen Sutcliffe – a reminder of how fun and daring the books could be, playfully using time travel and parallel universes to question what artists leave for posterity.

Burgess was aware that his own legacy would be mottled. He orchestrated his life like a music hall compere in two jaw-dropping autobiographies. His most delicious sentences mix eloquence with pungent filth. He liked to experiment with language, but he also knew how to deliver rollicking reads. Though a pioneer of socialist educational projects, as a wealthy writer he became, notoriously, a UK tax exile.

In Burgess’s eyes, he was a sort of anarchist – an idea that’s certainly borne out in his writing. One of the best descriptions of his work was coined by Burgess himself, reviewing his own pseudonymous novel Inside Mr Enderby in The Yorkshire Post (a stunt that earned him the sack): “How thin and under-savoury everything seems after Enderby’s gross richness.” Gross richness is about right. In books as in life, Burgess really knew how to pack it in.

From It Comes at Night to A Ghost Story, a new breed of horror is creeping into the multiplex, replacing jump-scares with existential dread. We talk to the auteurs breaking all the rules

It Comes at Night review – fiercely watchable post-apocalyptic chiller Read more

‘DO NOT GO SEE IT COMES AT NIGHT, ITS SO NOT WORTH WATCHING, WORST MOVIE EVER HANDS DOWN”. Twitter was filled with countless such posts after the US release of It Comes at Night last month. Mainstream moviegoers went in expecting a straight-up horror; they came out unsure about what they’d seen, and they didn’t like it. Critics, and a certain section of viewers, have loved the film, but its Cinemascore rating – determined by moviegoers’ opening-night reactions – is a D.

You can understand the confusion. The title alone strongly suggests It Comes at Night is a horror movie. As does the movie’s trailer, whose ingredients include a post-apocalyptic scenario, a cabin in the woods, gas masks, shotguns, prisoners, a stern patriarch (Joel Edgerton), and warnings never to leave doors unlocked or go out at night. It’s by no means false advertising, it’s just that this tense, minimal movie doesn’t play by accepted rules.



“I didn’t set out to make a horror movie per se,” says Trey Edward Shults, the film’s 28-year-old writer-director. “I just set out to make something personal and that’s what it turned into. I put a lot of my own fears into it, and if fear equates with horror then, yeah, it’s horror. But it’s not a conventional horror movie.”



Considering that horror is the place where we explore our mortal and societal fears, the genre is actually one of the safest spaces in cinema. More than any other genre, horror movies are governed by rules and codes: vampires don’t have reflections; the “final girl” will prevail; the warnings of the gas station attendant/mystical Native American/creepy old woman will go unheeded; the evil will ultimately be defeated, or at least explained, but not in a way that closes off the possibility of a sequel. The rules are our flashlight as we venture into the unknown. But in some respects, they’ve made horror a realm of what Donald Rumsfeld would describe as “known unknowns”.

No wonder some film-makers are starting to question what happens when you switch the flashlight off. What happens when you stray beyond those cast-iron conventions and wander off into the darkness? You might find something even scarier. You might find something that’s not scary at all. What could be emerging here is a new sub-genre. Let’s call it “post-horror”.



To its fans, at least, It Comes at Night is all the scarier because you don’t know exactly where the horror is going to come from. There’s a civilisation-levelling apocalypse and a contagious virus and a Blair Witchy forest, but the film is more interested in the horrors within. Edgerton and his family form a nervy alliance with another in a similar predicament, and with shotguns to hand and trust in short supply, the threat of violence is never far away. There is grief, guilt, regret and paranoia. There are family bonds, which turn from protective to constrictive. The teenage son is plagued by nightmares. And then there’s simply the darkness, which the film’s visuals make tremendous use of. It’s amazing how unsettling it can be just watching someone with a lantern wandering around in the pitch black night. It’s easier to identify what’s not scary.



Horror is film’s most profitable genre which means variations on haunted houses, psychos and zombies

“I’m aware that the title sounds like a dope monster movie or something, but it speaks to the movie thematically, not in the literal sense,” says Shults. He turned off all the lights in his Texas home and wandered around with a torch to get a feel for the movie, he confesses. He also researched genocides and societal cycles of violence. But the story really stems from his personal anxieties. Shults talks of his estranged father, who had a history of addiction, and died shortly before he wrote the movie. He confessed his regret to his son on his deathbed.



“Death is the unknown. We don’t know,” he says, “And that’s always terrifying. But then more so is regret. The way you led your life, the decisions you made. That terrifies me all the time.” As a former business-school student who quit college against his parents’ advice to pursue film-making, the fear of making the wrong decision was clearly present for Shults. What emboldened him to switch careers was landing a job with local auteur Terrence Malick, working on The Tree of Life. “I don’t know if he knows, but he changed the course of my whole life,” says Shults. “What I was inspired by is just how unorthodox you can be … just think outside of the box and find the right way to make a movie for you.”

That’s not a sentiment horror producers really want to hear these days. Horror is the most profitable genre in the industry and it’s booming. This year is set to be horror’s best ever, led by titles like Get Out (which has made $252m globally on a budget of $4.5m), and M Night Shyamalan’s Split ($277m on a $9m budget). As a result, there’s a market for horrors with low budgets and mass appeal. Which basically means variations on well-established themes: supernatural possession, haunted houses, psychos, zombies.



This is the market post-horror is reacting against. Shults cites the influence of Roman Polanski, whose celebrated “apartment trilogy” – Repulsion, The Tenant and Rosemary’s Baby – were similar exercises in refashioning horror tropes with an auteur sensibility, as were Nicolas Roeg’s Don’t Look Now and Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining. But those were in the era of well-resourced studio horror, now young film-makers like Shults must make a distinctive impression on an indie budget. (It Comes at Night has already recouped its budget many times over, incidentally.)

A number of other recent films could fit into the post-horror category. Last year’s The Witch, for example, which went into the New England woods with a devout 17th-century family. Again, the title and trailer suggested a straight horror movie, but while it was steeped in authentic satanic lore, The Witch was short on jump-scares and frantic chases, and explanations. It did, at least, have a witch in it. But again, it was marketed at mainstream audiences, who felt like they’d been conned, and took to Twitter with “WORST MOVIE EVER” sentiments.



Taking a different tack was Olivier Assayas’ Personal Shopper, which wove supernatural elements into its understated study of a Parisian fashion assistant, played by Kristen Stewart. She’s seeking “a sign” from her dead twin brother. She believes in ghosts, and from what we see, she’s not making it up either, so when a stalker starts texting her, we’re not sure if they’re living or dead. Technically, it’s a horror movie, but nobody would confuse Personal Shopper with The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2. In a similar vein, so to speak, Nicholas Winding Refn brought bloodthirsty lesbian vampire supermodels to LA’s fashion world in The Neon Demon – a variation on a well-worn horror tropes, but in no way traditional.



I was having a crisis about my place in the universe … but I also had a desire to make a movie with a guy in a sheet

The movie that could really seal post-horror is A Ghost Story, an extraordinary, exploratory film that goes on the release in the US this week (and comes to the UK in August). Again, it’s a title that creates certain expectations. There is a ghost, but it’s Casey Affleck draped in a white sheet with two eye holes cut out of it. He’s basically a human emoji of a ghost. Having been killed in a car crash, he haunts the house of his grief-stricken young widow, played by Rooney Mara, but she can’t actually see him. When she moves out, he’s stuck there. Forever. New tenants come and go. The building itself eventually goes. Time loops in on itself, and the story expands from personal trauma into the realms of cosmic speculation.



“I wanted to engage with the archetypes and iconography of ghost films and haunted house movies, without ever crossing over into actually being a horror film,” says writer-director David Lowery, who made A Ghost Story with the proceeds of his previous movie, a remake of Disney’s Pete’s Dragon. “Look at any horror film and you can trace it back to a particular social or personal anxiety, and this film is no different in that regard: I was having a big-picture existential crisis about my place in the universe, and at the same time I was having a very personal conflict with my wife about where we were going to move to. And wrapped up in all of that was my longstanding desire to make a movie with a guy in a sheet.”

Lowery is no snob, though: “I go and see most horror films that come out, but I’m usually watching with my hands over my eyes.” He speaks with admiration of The Conjuring 2. But Lowery also draws on a more east-Asian view of spirits and the supernatural. Tsai Ming-liang’s Goodbye, Dragon Inn, for example, set in a “haunted” cinema where ghosts and the living sit side by side. Or the films of Thailand’s Apichatpong Weerasethakul, in which the ghost of a dead wife can casually turn up at the dinner table or a son can be transformed into a forest-dwelling wookiee and nobody bats an eyelid. Weerasethakul’s entire career is basically post-horror.



It is telling that It Comes at Night, The Witch and A Ghost Story were all put out by A24 Films, a young company that has already found Oscar success with the likes of Moonlight and Room. If anyone’s pushing horror into new realms, it’s them, but isn’t it about time? There will always be a place for movies that reacquaint us with our primal fears and frighten the bejesus out of us. But when it comes to tackling the big, metaphysical questions, the horror framework is in danger of being too rigid to come up with new answers – like a dying religion. Lurking just beyond its cordon is a vast black nothingness, waiting for us to shine a light into it.

The 28-year-old Texan film-maker Trey Edwards Shults is a former crew member on Terrence Malick movies who made a big impression last year with his no-budget debut feature at SXSW, Krisha, about an eccentric older woman showing up at a family reunion party. For his follow-up he has put together this very impressive movie whose title, It Comes at Night, might suggest straight horror. But, that isn’t really the case and the title doesn’t entirely mesh with what happens in the film.

Actually, what you get is a claustrophobic psychological chiller in the more realist post-apocalyptic vein, set in a lonely world where law and order and human decencies have broken down due to some unspecified plague, which is liable to surface again if brutal quarantine discipline is relaxed for a single moment. Those who have been spared the great horror that has swept civilisation away must get by with their families as best they can – barricaded by their own anxiety, deeply and even murderously suspicious of strangers.

It is a downbeat cousin to 28 Days Later or The Road, but perhaps more like Stephen Fingleton’s recent Northern Irish movie The Survivalist or Michael Haneke’s uncompromisingly bleak The Time of the Wolf. Joel Edgerton plays Paul, the bearded and grim-faced patriarch of a family who are holed up in a fortified home in a forest somewhere in North America. He lives with his wife Sarah (Carmen Ejogo) and teen son Travis (Kelvin Harrison Jr). The film begins with an intimately horrible scene: Sarah’s elderly dad Bud (David Pendleton) has just succumbed to the illness, with ugly spores all over his body, and the two other men put on masks and gloves to take his body out to the surrounding woodland to be burned.

As if this wasn’t traumatic enough, an intruder arrives: Will (Christopher Abbott) who says that he only wants water for his wife Kim (Riley Keough) and their child. This desperate man seems plausible enough – Paul can sympathise and sees a way to feel human again, a redemption, after their devastating bereavement.

However, Paul starts to notice tiny inconsistencies in Will’s story. Paul is scared of interaction, causing situations that spread and replicate, like the disease: he is frightened of his family being infected by alien relationships over which he has no control. Even when he is happy enough with Will and his family, it is clear that Paul still cannot quite rid himself of the notion that they, however healthy, could be the disease. Will and Kim’s child has a habit of sleepwalking, which creates its own miasma of anxiety and Travis seems to have some sort of growing friendship with Kim.

Get political and have great scares: the new rules of horror movies Read more

Everything about the atmosphere in It Comes at Night is tense, and the tension comes both from within and without – human betrayal and airborne sickness. At its most effective, it achieves a combination I associate with British television post-apocalyptic drama from the 70s and 80s, like Survivors or Threads: scary-plus-depressing. The immediate menace is flavoured with a grimmer, longer-term sense that, however the present danger pans out, this is what life is going to be like from now on.

In a rare moment of candour, Paul says that before the great catastrophe, he was a teacher – his speciality being Roman history. It is an elegant moment of irony. The civilisation that they enjoyed, until only a few years or months before, has now vanished into exactly that same distant irrelevance as classical antiquity.

It Comes at Night is a drama that doesn’t feel the need to tie up loose ends or deliver neat twists or pat explanations. It mirrors what life would be like for survivors and their attitude to strangers or even friends whose motivations can’t truly be known. These are people who might have to lie, to cheat, to betray even those they like, who under other circumstances they would feel a debt of gratitude towards – but this is what is needed to live and the old rules have been superseded. It is a fiercely watchable film.

Research shows that in 2016 alone, 82m unintended pregnancies, 25m unsafe abortions and 124,000 maternal deaths were averted thanks to the use of contraceptives. Yet despite this, many people in the world still can’t count on access to family planning. And cuts to US funding as part of Donald Trump’s reinstatement of the “global gag rule” mean that there are even more challenging times ahead.



Lucy Lamble looks at the importance of factoring the growing population of young people into the debate, and the power of family planning to affect economic development in poorer countries. She talks to Beth Schlachter of FP2020; Julia Bunting from the Population Council; Liz Ford, Global development’s deputy editor; Ali Kaviri, a youth rights and women’s campaigner in Uganda; Annet Nabizzizzi, a volunteer community health worker at Reproductive Health Uganda; and Annet Kyarimpa Mukabe, a coordinator for safe motherhood at RHU.

For 1.8 billion young people, family planning will be vital in shaping lives and livelihoods. As leaders prepare for the London Family Planning Summit, Lucy Lamble looks at the challenges ahead

LL There are currently an estimated 1.8 billion young people in the world; the biggest cohort of young people ever, with nearly nine out of 10 of them living in developing countries. In 2012, London hosted a summit that set the agenda for family planning up to 2020. For a long time adolescents have not featured prominently on the development agenda, but increasingly there’s a realisation that their futures depend on being able to plan their families.



Preview clip from Uganda report So if we are not giving information to young boys and girls, then they don’t get the knowledge and empowerment they need to make great decisions. And of course, it affects the livelihood of the girl and the babies that they’re giving birth to.

LL In 2016 alone, 82m unintended pregnancies, 25m unsafe abortions and 124,000 maternal deaths were averted due to the use of modern effective methods of family planning. But despite this many people in the world still can’t count on access to contraception, and now many countries are about to face additional problems as the US cuts funding.

Rich countries pledge $2.6bn for family planning in global south Read more

I’m Lucy Lamble and this month on the Global development podcast ahead of the second London Family Planning Summit, we’re looking at how these challenges will affect the growing population of young people in the developing world and consequently the economy of their countries.

At the 2012 London summit, some of the world’s richer countries pledged $2.6bn over the next eight years and FP2020 was set up to monitor that promise. Beth Schlachter is their executive director.

BS In 2012, building on the excitement from the London summit, the global community set the goal of expanding access to contraception so that 120 million additional women and girls in the world’s 69 lowest income countries would be able to use contraception. And by that we mean that they would have access to a range of high quality products, that they would have healthcare services that consider their needs and are based on high quality information, on counselling sessions that really work with women to determine what their needs are and what would best suit their purposes.

LL Julia Bunting is from the Population Council.

JB When you give a woman or a young person the right to determine freely and for themselves whether, when and how many children to have, then their life chances are transformed. They don’t have unintended pregnancies, they’re not at much risk of unsafe abortions and maternal mortality. We see that they choose to have fewer children and to invest more in those children. So those children have greater life chances; they’re likely to be more healthy, they have more years of education and they’re more likely to be productive in the labour force.

And when we see this happen at an aggregate level – the choices of many individuals happening – then we see real benefits for countries in terms of their economic growth and development as well as things like security and stability.

LL That’s what’s known as the demographic dividend. How does that work?

JB The demographic dividend is a phenomenon that occurs when there is increased access to contraception that leads to reductions in fertility and that creates a change in the population age structure. So what we see is that there are fewer young people and more people of working age. And when we get that dependency ratio the number of young people to working age people when that reduces what we see is a real opportunity for economic growth because there are more people working.

Now for that to come to be, it’s not just that you need to increase access to contraception, you also need to increase human capital, improve people’s health and education, and you need to implement policies around labour and employment and trade.

And the demographic dividend is a very real phenomenon. We’ve seen it happening in countries around the world. So if you just take some of the examples, for example, the Asian tigers – the east Asian tigers countries like South Korea and Taiwan and Singapore – they experienced the demographic dividend between the late 1960s and the 1990s, and the economic miracle that we saw in those countries was in part a result of these investments. And they estimate that about a third of that economic growth was a result of harnessing the demographic dividend.

LL FP2020 publishes a report every year looking at the progress across the 69 countries they target.

BS Where we’ve seen considerable progress is in a lot of the difficult work that has to take place for governments to provide programmes to meet the needs of their citizens. So a lot of the work that we do as well is around social norms and around expanding the understanding within communities for why women should have access to products that give them control over the most intimate part of their lives. So we do a lot of work to help women understand what contraception is; to help communities support women having access to that, with the understanding that is women have more autonomy as they have healthier lives, as they have healthier children at birth and that they’re able to support them through early childhood, that we then have healthier families, stronger economics in local communities and potential for growth overall economically in countries.

So family planning is one of those interesting areas of work where both human rights and economics come together in a really interesting and challenging way. So we have to look at both sides of it, both the technical, the bureaucratic, the delivery side as well as the human side of healthcare and need for individual people.

LL Global development deputy editor Liz Ford travelled to Uganda where sex education is under great pressure.

AK So my name is Ali Kaviri. I’m a youth rights and women’s campaigner in Uganda. A Women Deliver young leader and I’m also the World Contraception Day ambassador for Uganda.

LF What about sex education in Uganda, is it taught in schools?

AK I will give you my experience. Like I only gotten about sex education maybe just a few phrases during biology lessons, where we draw the female reproductive organ. Where we would draw a female reproductive system, a male reproductive system and then have discussions and all that.

But in terms of sexuality education, or comprehensive sexuality education, right now they don’t even have this conversation, it’s banned. That means organisations cannot even take this message to young people. Young people now are just wondering on their own.

LL In Uganda, many believe that young people should not be educated about sex but instead be taught to abstain. Yet, adolescents are having sex. According to the country’s 2016 Demographic and Health survey, a quarter of girls aged 15 to 19 have had a baby or are pregnant. Annet Kyarimpa Mukabe is coordinator of safe motherhood with Reproductive Health Uganda.

AKM Uganda has one of the highest teenage pregnancies in the world, estimated at 25%. And one of the contributing factors is lack of access to family planning, cultural and traditional barriers that inhibit young girls from talking about sexuality issues. But also the environment in which young people access sexual and reproductive health services is not very conducive.

Uganda fails to target gay men and sex workers in fast-track HIV initiative Read more

LL Annet Nabizzizzi is a volunteer for Reproductive Health Uganda in Mbale.

AN I dropped from school because of unwanted pregnancy. I am a mother through very painful condition. I was 16 years, I gave birth at 17 years. I feel so bad for the young ones, the young girls. At least I counsel … I try to counsel them not to be like me.

LF So, Annet, if your 15-year-old daughter came up to you and wanted to talk to you or ask about taking contraception what would you say, or what would you do?

AN I first counsel her. But if she do insist I give the [contraceptives].

LF How would you feel about giving her something like that?

AN I feel very bad. I feel bad. I feel bad because early sex is not good.

LF But what would compel you to give her what she wanted?

AN Because she might get pregnant when she’s still in school.

AK What now this means for us as young people and especially with saying a lot in terms of increasing access to information so you can make informed choices in life, we’re going to see many young girls you know deferred. We’re going to have so many, let’s say, girls drop out of school due to pregnancy-related cases, due to child marriages, due to quite a number of things. And that means it has a bearing of course to the economy. That means you’re having child families that cannot be able to support and our people shall continue to live in poverty for many years to come.

LL In January this year, President Trump reinstated the Mexico City policy – also known as the “global gag rule”, which bars any overseas organisation receiving US aid from mentioning abortion in their work. In April, the US administration also cut funding to the United Nations Population Fund. Julia Bunting again.

JB We actually had decades of evidence around what works in family planning and decades of evidence that really shows the many and multiple benefits. It’s absolutely clear that the decision being put forward by the Trump administration to reduce their commitment to international family planning but to broader to health and development are going to be devastating. We know that when the Mexico City policy has been enacted in the past – under previous Republican administrations – that it’s led to reductions in services and to closures in clinics. And this version under President Trump is even bigger than that. We’re talking now about dramatic reductions in funding, not just in family planning but also across global health and development. And we expect that the results will be devastating for women and men and young people around the world.

LL Uganda may well be one of the countries affected.

AK I also happen to be a chair of the African Youth and Adolescent Network on Population Development, which is largely connected by UNFPA. And there’s a lot of support that we are receiving from UNFPA that is aimed at reaching out to youth groups ensuring that we have access to family planning information and services, to ensure that there is support for our comprehensive sexuality education, support aimed at saving mothers from dying, saving young mothers contracting fistula and so many other issues. So, that alone has a very big impact on women’s reproductive choices and it’s going to affect especially young people in Uganda that are heavily affected in this country.

LL The US announcement leaves a big funding gap, which means that national governments will now have to think hard about prioritising family planning in their budgets.

BS What we’re going to have to do is also see if our development partners in countries can do more as well to meet some of their need. UNFPA provides contraceptives in a number of countries but they also provide technical assistance and that’s where we really need to make sure that people on the ground to help developing countries to build their capacities, to expand their own programmes. So it’s those partnerships and efficiencies they’re in that are one of the areas that we’re going to have to look at in order to be able to maintain the programmes we have and to grow them for the future.

LL How are people on the ground going to get round this? Ali Kaviri again.

AK Through the Women Deliver programme and particularly through the World Contraception Day project that’s potentially between Women Deliver and Bayer, together with youth advocates, are being supported to launch a maiden, sort of, platform in this country. And that’s the Youth SRHR website. You can access it online. We are trying to ease information access to young people.

We have a broadcast radio, which is integrated with the website, and it’s purely broadcasting information around family planning. There’s a page where you can learn basically about family planning. You can even access some youth [information] that we have been able to release. You can have an interface with experts.

LL Annet Kyarimpa Mukabe.

AKM There are quite a number of non-government organisations that are providing youth friendly services. But this is limited in terms of numbers, geographical coverage and the reach for young people. So I think it’s important for governments to have youth friendly services in the public health facilities. That will address the stigma, but it will create space for young people. Space in terms of physical infrastructure, having trained staff in providing youth friendly services. But also at community level to be able to address the cultural and traditional barriers that stop young girls from demanding and using family and sexual reproductive services.

LL As stakeholders prepare to meet at the 2017 summit this summer, Beth Schlachter believes that now more than ever the global community must pull together.

BS So I think the summit comes at a perfect time because it allows us to plan together how we’re going to work together smarter and more effectively going forward, recognising that this a period of transition and uncertainty. So it’s a really positive moment for pulling the community together to say we’ve been working on family planning for 50 years; we’ve weathered different kinds of transitions before. We’re a strong sector, we know the work that we need to do, now let’s just get on with it. And let’s make sure we’re working the partnership in a way that keeps everybody together and making those decisions that are going to allow us to advance.

At Emma Hart’s studio, two assistants are helping the artist with last-minute touches to graphic patterns inside a group of outsized ceramic heads. The heads appear to be consuming them as they lean deep inside, torches strapped to their foreheads, delicate paintbrushes in hand. In a little over a week, the finished works will be moved to London’s Whitechapel Gallery where they’ll be strung from the ceiling like lamps: the centrepiece of Mamma Mia!, Hart’s show as laureate of the biennial Max Mara art prize for women.

Formed, fired and glazed in Italy, during Hart’s six-month residency for the prize, the heads show the influence of time spent both in professional ceramics studios, and as an observer in a centre for family therapy. “Both are driven by patterns,” Hart explains. “The psychiatrist is trying to unravel human behavioural patterns, and the studio to generate a visual pattern.”



Inside one head, the pattern shows young women entangled in a vine of jealousy, among the stylised jaws of Venus flytraps. In another, manicured fingers push hot red buttons, rendered in the greens, blues and yellows of a thermal imaging camera. A third shows overlapping rows of curves, which transform from McDonald’s golden arches into a line of pink breasts as the pattern mounts the sides. Freud would have a field day, but that’s the point.



Facebook Twitter Pinterest Emma Hart’s Venus fly-trap design for the inside of one of her ceramics: I Want What You’ve Got, Even When I Am Asleep, 2017. Photograph: Courtesy the artist

In her early 40s, Hart’s work marries academic foundations (she has a PhD in fine arts) with emotional honesty and a sharp sense of humour. A current touring exhibition – Love Life – with fellow artist Jonathan Baldock, features ceramic-stockinged feet that terminate at the toe end with open mouths, like sock puppets nagging about some mundane chore. A sculpture of a pair of squeezed-out, rolled-up paint tubes suggests both a pair of weeping eyes and sore sagging breasts: more domestic angst, perhaps from a self-pitying artist struggling with new motherhood.



Hart studied photography and only started working with clay – in what she would be the first to admit was an amateur way – a few years ago. In earlier interviews she had spoken about her relationship to it as an expressive medium, relishing the tactility and even slightly cathartic experience of handling and forming the stuff. “There was a big fight to get the clay to do what I wanted. That was really important – it was interesting to be dumb and not know what you were doing – but it comes with a lot of stress. The problem is that it maybe takes 20 goes to get three pieces and that can grind you down.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Emma Hart’s giant jug ‘heads’ take shape in the Faenza studio where she learned Italian techniques. Photograph: Courtesy of the artist

But her residency in Faenza changed all that. The small Italian town plays an important role in the history of ceramics, lending its name to faience – also known as maiolica – tin-glazed pottery that has been produced in the town since the 14th century. And while there, Hart learned alongside ceramic historians and artisans steeped in traditional techniques. “Now I can check in with experts along the way, and, to be honest, I feel relief and excitement that that’s how it could be in the future.”

That study has fed into the pieces she has made for Mamma Mia! The ceramic heads are modelled on the inverted form of traditional maiolica jugs (in a sly domestic reference, the artist has scored lines on them as if they were merely humble kitchen measuring jugs). Fired in a kiln “the size of my bathroom”, they were glazed with the assistance of a traditional faience studio. Inverted, the mouth of the jug transforms into a nose, and the heads will cast pools of light on the floor in the form of speech bubbles as though they were conversing.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest I,I,I, 2017 … another of the designs painted on the inside of Emma Hart’s ceramic heads. Photograph: Courtesy the artist

Before arriving in Faenza, Hart had spent two months in Milan watching families attend therapy sessions (the “Milan Systemic Approach”) at the Scuola Mara Selvini Palazzoli. She watched therapists identify cycles of behaviour within family groups, and working with genograms – family trees that express emotional relationships between individuals through the use of coded coloured lines, references to which appear in the installation of the finished works.

Hart even engaged in a process known as “sculptura” with her own husband and young daughter, which saw the three of them standing in a sequence of emotionally expressive postures for half a minute at a time. (The experience was she says, “actually quite positive”.)



Much of Hart’s art has a kind of gallows jocularity. Love Life is riddled with morbid puns, both visual and verbal. In one work, hanging salami sausages are shaped to read, ominously, “Your Back”. At Whitechapel, ceiling fans made of giant cutlery appear to slice through the hanging heads as they rotate.

Hart has returned to Faenza half a dozen times since her residency finished, and has developed a close working relationship with ceramicist Aida Bertozzi. “She’s seen it all and done it all,” says Hart. “She’s not fazed by me saying, ‘I want to dig in the clay like a dog for a week.’”

Perhaps more valuable than the skills and knowledge she has acquired, Hart’s time in Italy has taught her that, in art as in motherhood, it’s OK to admit that you don’t know what you’re doing, that you can’t cope by yourself, and that actually, you’d appreciate a little help.

Elephants are being exploited to entertain tourists in south-east Asia, and kept in harsh conditions, says a new report from an animal rights NGO

Thousands of elephants being used for entertainment across Asia are kept in cruel, abusive conditions fuelled by the growing tourism industry, World Animal Protection has found.

Three out of four elephants surveyed in south-east Asia’s popular tourist destinations are living in harsh conditions where they are being used for rides, with mostly steel or wooden saddles, and tied in chains less than three metres long.

The scale of suffering experienced by elephants is “severe”, according to the animal rights NGO which assessed almost 3,000 elephants living in 220 venues in Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Nepal and Sri Lanka, and India between mid 2014 and late 2016.

The majority of captive elephants are taken from the wild, where just 50,000 remain in Asia. Animal rights groups say elephants are made to submit to humans by going through a process known as “the crush” – where baby elephants are taken from their mothers and forced into a training process that, at its worst, can include being restrained in a pen and beaten for several weeks.

At least 77% of the captive elephants surveyed in the report, which was released on 6 July, are chained day and night when not being used for entertainment purposes and experienced very little social interaction with other elephants. The animals are fed poor diets, have no access to proper veterinary care and are often exposed to stressful environments with loud music and a large number of tourists.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Elephants used for entertainment in Thailand in 2016.

These conditions go against elephants’ most basic needs. Elephants are intelligent, socially developed animals, which form complex hierarchies within herds. But in captivity elephants are forced to unnaturally submit to humans; they have been found to live shorter lives, experience behavioural problems, are more likely to develop chronic diseases and are less likely to reproduce.

The captive elephant population is now thought to make up one-quarter to one-third of the remaining elephants in the region.

Despite conservation efforts, Thailand has seen a 30% increase in elephant entertainment venues – from circus performances to riding or bathing with elephants. As many as 40% of tourists from the top 10 countries visiting Thailand said they had been on or were planning to do an elephant ride, which translates as a demand for around 12.8 million elephant rides in the country, according to the report.

Secret footage obtained of the wild elephants sold into captivity in Chinese zoos Read more

This coincides with the growing number of foreign visitors to Thailand which reached 32.6 billion last year – a rise of 9% from 2015.

Elephant tourism remains popular because it can be “a hidden form of cruelty”, said Chiara Vitali, a wildlife expert at World Animal Protection. The process of the crush “will happen before any tourist sees an elephant, so they might see an animal that’s quite chilled out – but it had that beaten into it when it was an infant”, she said.

The organisation believes the best place for captive elephants are genuine sanctuaries, where the animals can roam free, bond and have their herd structure – and where tourists can see the elephants in a respectful way.

“There is an urgent need for tourist education and regulation of wildlife tourist attractions worldwide,” said Dr Jan Schmidt-Burbach, global wildlife and veterinary advisor at World Animal Protection.

“Venues that offer tourists a chance to watch elephants in genuine sanctuaries are beacons of hope that can encourage the urgently needed shift in the captive elephant tourism industry.”

Another report released this week on 4 July found an obscure Chinese town to be at the centre of an ivory smuggling trade network, exposing weaknesses in China’s domestic ivory ban which came into place in March 2017.

The Environmental Investigation Agency spent three years investigating the town of Shuidong, and found it to be home to a network of ivory trafficking syndicates reaching east and west Africa, according to the EIA. The group’s influence extended to the poaching hotspots of Tanzania and Mozambique.

Researchers say the smuggling group was still active as of late June 2017, describing Shuidong as the world’s largest hub for ivory trafficking.

“What EIA discovered in Shuidong ... clearly shows transnational criminal networks are operating with near-total impunity,” said Mary Rice, EIA executive director. “It is vital that enforcement agencies in Africa and China put these criminals out of business immediately.”

An obvious question that may immediately enter a casual observer’s mind after seeing a streaker careen onto a sports field, all legs pumping, flesh wobbling and bits dangling, is also a simple one: why?

“It’s just pure laughs and giggles,” says James, a moderate streaker who last de-robed under the amused and possibly bemused gaze of the public at the Sunday Community Cup in Melbourne two weeks ago.

“It’s exhilarating for the first moment or two when you get on and you can hear the roar of the crowd. You can hear the laughter on the sidelines – whether they’re laughing with you or at you – but in all cases it’s just good fun.”

A brief history of streaking in sport Read more

James, whose full name Guardian Australia chose not to reveal, might be classed, if such a classification system existed, as a mid-level streaker – he isn’t a “one-too-many-drinks-bad-decision-never-again” streaker, nor is he a big hitter who chooses major sporting events to show his wares.

Instead, he lies somewhere in between: he has for the past four years streaked at the annual charity event in Melbourne, which has garnered a reputation for being a safe space for nudie run enthusiasts since its inception in 1993.

“I’ll just hand out drink bottles to the team, making sure everyone’s hydrated while doing a circle around [the field],” he says. “I might throw a cartwheel in there if I want to. I just do my full lap, come back around and do a couple of high fives at the end of it. Then I just chuck my clothes back on and everyone’s had a good laugh for two or three minutes.”

Times are changing though and this year, for the first time at the Community Cup, streakers were targeted by police. Three arrests were made and the men, all in their 20s, were charged with indecent and obscene behaviour and fined $626 each. James says there were more, including women, but they were the lucky ones who “somehow got away” with it.

The clampdown on pitch invaders is in many ways understandable. Streaking may be “just good fun” and the reaction of the crowd more often than not reflects that, but on occasion it can go wrong. Wati Holmwood’s bumbling charge onto the State of Origin pitch in 2013, for example, disrupted the game and prompted anger in some quarters. Jimmy Jump regularly interrupts matches in Spain. Worse, with people entering sporting arenas unchecked there remains the possibility of a repeat of the horrific Monica Seles incident in 1993.

Still, the urge to get naked and run onto a field can prove irresistible for some. A video taken at last weekend’s All Blacks-British & Irish Lions Test in Auckland proved the practice is alive and well, no matter the size or importance of the occasion. This particular fence-jumper displayed remarkable composure as he sat in his seat, naked from the waist down, and calmly waited for his chance despite substantial heckling from fellow fans about his state of undress.

“It was a bit of spur-of-the-moment peer pressure from a few different people, my father being one of them and yeah, went for a bit of a run,” the man, 23, told NZME. “To be honest, not a lot was going through my head, just thought I’d have a bit of fun and they obviously didn’t like it as much as I did. It was still fun while it lasted.”

He was fined $5,000 – more than $1,000 of which had been crowdfunded at the time of writing – but for many streakers, who are often accused of seeking attention, that’s a small price to pay for their moment of fame.

Money itself has increasingly a motivational factor since streaking was first witnessed in sporting arenas in the mid-1970s. Savvy marketing managers soon realised the potential for spruiking their wares in front of, in some cases, global television audiences. That’s quite some market reach.

A man who ran onto the pitch at Super Bowl XXXVIII with an online casino’s web address scrawled in marker pen across his back claimed he had been paid $1m to do so. (As an aside, for purists this was not strictly speaking a streak – his modesty was retained by a thong or G-string; a bona fide streak requires the full monty).

Some television stations have moved to address this: often viewers are left in the dark as cameras pan away in the event of a streak. The message is clear: don’t give them the publicity they crave. A Channel Nine spokesperson says their sports arm, Wide World of Sports, may choose to show high and wide shots if play is interrupted, “but always with commentary criticising the practice”.

For James though, it’s not about self-promotion of financial gain. His motivation comes purely from an entertainment perspective – both his own and that of the watching crowd. “I never seek publicity whatsoever,” he says after Guardian Australia sought the interview. “There’s no personal gain from it. Its just for my own amusement, something to cross off your bucket list.”

From the Observer archive, 17 March 1974: the naked truth about streaking Read more

The runs are intoxicating – that’s why he has kept coming back to the Community Cup – but this year’s arrests might have proved to be a watershed moment.

“It does deter me,” he says. “I’m still a uni student. I still want to see the world. Those guys who were caught, it’s an issue on their record. I understand the police are doing their job, they’ve got to uphold the law and I don’t blame them for what they did. At the same point, it’s always been turned a blind eye. It’s definitely shaken things up a bit.”

If retirement does beckon, at least his mother can be proud of his career. “I have told my mum,’ he says. “She laughs about it and thinks it’s quite humorous. My step father just shrugs.

“No one’s disgusted by it, everyone’s cheering it on just as much as a part of the game. It’s just a funny tradition that’s been upheld.”

Arcola, London This powerful real-life account of life in Jenin in the West Bank, is a raw and sharply comic production, asking if the stage can be as powerful as an AK47

Ahmed lives in the Jenin refugee camp on the West Bank. He has grown up under occupation, likes football, falls in love with a girl he spots on the street, and discovers an unexpected taste for the limelight when he accidentally walks into the local Stone theatre. However, he is also fascinated by the balaclava that he finds hidden in his parents’ bedroom, a legacy of his father’s time as a resistance fighter.

Part of the Shubbak festival of Arab culture, Ahmed Tobasi performs his own story, written for the stage by Hassan Abdulrazzak, which charts his journey from Jihadist to actor. Along the way he asks if the stage really can be as powerful as an AK47. The enthusiasm with which the audience claps at the end suggests that it can be, even if it’s not entirely clear whether we are clapping the show itself or Tobasi’s remarkable personal voyage of transformation that saw him imprisoned for four years at the age of 17 before coming under the influence of Juliano Mer Kharmis, one of the leaders of the Jenin Freedom Theatre.



Mer Kharmis was a stern taskmaster, and a man who believed that “theatre can be as violent as the gun”. He was gunned down outside the theatre in 2011.

Jenin's Freedom theatre: from death and destruction, a message of hope Read more

This is pretty rough and ready theatre, and often quite literal. When Tobasi takes a bath he stands in a bucket of water, and when he is taken to a prison in the desert sand is poured over the stage. But what it lacks in sophistication it makes up for with brio and wry humour. Jenin, we are told, is very beautiful with ”glorious bags of garbage everywhere.” Tobasi plays a number of characters with a sharp eye for the comic, including the leaders of the warring factions in the prison, and also family and friends.



During the performance images of the dead – including Mer Kharmis and Tobasi’s childhood friend killed during the Intifada – are pasted to the wall as a reminder of how raw grief remains and why the cycle of violence continues from one generation to the next. Tobasi is one of the lucky ones: he found refuge in Norway. But, he is still finding new weapons to tell his own and his people’s story.

The long-awaited UN report into Israel's reoccupation of the main cities of the West Bank criticised both Palestinian militants and Israeli army tactics yesterday, but found no evidence to support claims that Israeli forces were responsible for a massacre in the Jenin refugee camp.

The report criticised Israel for the "widespread destruction of Palestinian property" in Jenin during the operation earlier this year but said Palestinian claims at the time that some 500 Palestinians had been wantonly killed "have not been substantiated".

The Israeli foreign ministry praised the report, saying it cleared up a "misconception" there had been a massacre.

Israel denied access to the UN team that prepared the report and gave it no information. It was forced to rely on published sources and statements from observers from six governments as well as from human rights organisations.

Around 1,500 families were made homeless when Israeli tanks and bulldozers demolished houses and shops in the narrow alleys in the heart of the refugee camp in April.

Palestinian officials as well as many foreign journalists said there had been a "massacre". The only reference to the word in the report itself is in eyewitness accounts "by survivors of the massacre at Jenin refugee camp" submitted by Jordan's UN mission.

In Jenin, where the refugee camp was levelled in several days of fighting, Palestinians despaired at what they considered the lack of international pressure on Israel to end the continuing curfews and withdraw. "This report will not provide anything for the Palestinian people," said Bassam Sbaihat, the Palestinian Authority official who liaises with the Israeli army, as he sat in his office near a vast mound of rubble where UN officials believe five bodies remain hidden.

The UN report said 52 Palestinian deaths had been confirmed by April 18, the same death toll reported by Israel. The UN findings mirrored those of Human Rights Watch. Up to half the Palestinian casualties may have been civilians rather than armed fighters, it said, but it was impossible to determine a precise figure.

Saeb Erekat, a senior negotiator for the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, said in mid-April that 500 people had been killed. The Israeli army spokesman, Brigadier Ron Kitrey, added to the confusion at the time by saying more than 200 people were dead in Jenin.

Israel initially agreed to a UN investigation but later claimed the team chosen by Kofi Annan, the secretary general, was not genuinely aimed at fact-finding. The Israeli government seized on the lack of corroboration of any massacre to say the whole investigation had come about "as the result of false Palestinian propaganda".

"The report overwhelmingly negates this Palestinian fabrication and repudiates the malicious lies spread regarding the issue", the foreign ministry said.

But the UN team has several criticisms of Israel's incursion, its biggest military deployment for two decades. It says that on at least three occasions Israeli forces targeted ambulances. Its use of heavy weaponry and helicopter gunships on densely populated civilian areas was disproportionate. Civilians were arbitrarily arrested and forced to strip. Round-the-clock curfews for several days left people without vital supplies or medical aid.

Palestinian militants are accused of violating international law by stockpiling weapons and putting fighters in the densely populated camp.

The report also looked at the entire West Bank reoccupation. Between March 1 and May 7, it said, 497 Palestinians had been killed in the West Bank. During the same period Israel endured around 16 terrorist bombings, mostly suicide attacks. More than 100 people were killed and scores wounded.

Mr Annan said he was confident the report was a "fair representation of a complex reality" but stressed that it dealt with abuses which continue. "While some of the facts may be in dispute, I think it is clear that the Palestinian population have suffered and are suffering humanitarian consequences which are very severe," he said. "I would hope that both parties will draw the right lessons from this tragic episode".

Nabil Shaath, a Palestinian cabinet minister, called the report an important step. "I know it doesn't satisfy everybody and it wasn't done in the way it should have been done. But still it identifies what happened in Jenin as a ... crime against humanity," he said.

However, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, Menzies Campbell, said: "This report is fatally flawed by the fact that the UN team of investigators ... was refused access to Jenin. Inevitably it undermines the authority of the secretary general."

Experts weigh in on a possible US reaction to North Korea’s successful intercontinental ballistic missile test, from further sanctions to diplomacy

Public urgency about the threat of North Korea developing a reliable long-range nuclear weapon capable of striking the US was sharpened by news of what Pyongyang and outside analysts say was a successful intercontinental ballistic missile test.



Any immediate US response must take into account the ability of North Korea to instantly launch a devastating strike against allies in Japan and South Korea, including the almost 30,000 US troops stationed on the Korean peninsula, with chemical, biological or possibly nuclear weapons. Conflict with China lurks as an additional grave concern.

What should or can the US do? Over the past two weeks, judging by his Twitter account, Donald Trump appears to have abandoned his original policy on North Korea, which was to rely on China to pressure its neighbor and trading partner to scrap its nuclear program.

While some experts stated clearly months ago that Trump’s policy would not work, other influential voices, such as an independent taskforce convened last year by the Council on Foreign Relations, strongly supported such a policy, urging US officials to “undertake a major diplomatic effort to elevate the issue to the top of the US-China bilateral relationship”.

The options currently on the table for the US break down roughly into four categories: sanctions and embargoes; diplomacy and concessions; cyber sabotage; and other military options. Here is a summary of expert opinion and analysis on each.

Sanctions and embargoes

North Korea has been the target of various financial and trade sanctions, including sanctions targeting the country’s key coal exports and an oil embargo, since it conducted its first nuclear test in 2006.

After the death of American exchange student Otto Warmbier following his detention in North Korea last month, the US expanded its sanctions policy to include secondary sanctions on a Chinese bank and two Chinese individuals for providing North Korea with access to international markets.

How did Otto Warmbier die? Read more

“We should be sending teams all over the world to shut down financial assets, enforce sanctions and interdict materials the regime uses for weapons,” wrote Wendy R Sherman, the chief US negotiator in the Iran nuclear deal. “We should press the United Nations to do more.”

But North Korea’s economy has not been crippled by sanctions, thanks in part to the continued trade with China.

“North Korea is far better off now than it was 11 years ago, and worlds apart from the famine of the 1990s,” wrote Benjamin Silverstein in The Diplomat. “Food insecurity prevails in North Korea but the country has not seen widespread starvation since the late 1990s.”

And “if we were going to impose crippling sanctions” Van Jackson, a defense expert at Victoria University, told the Asia New Zealand foundation, “the time to do it would have been well before it had nuclear-capable missiles, not after.”

Diplomacy and concessions

“Negotiate or else,” Jim Walsh of the MIT security studies program advised in a piece last week published by Axios:

During the nuclear age, dozens countries started down the path to nuclear weapons but reversed course. And there are cases where countries acquired or inherited nuclear weapons gave them up outright. Often, that happy result was accomplished not through war but diplomacy – agreements that stopped or rolled back a nuclear weapons program.”

“Opening dialogue is neither a reward nor a concession to North Korea; it is simply the only realistic way to reduce the growing dangers,” reads a new Guardian piece in support of negotiations:

Technological solutions – disabling launches through electronic or cyber attacks, or intercepting missiles – will be at best only partially successful. Sanctions may be part of the answer, but history shows that they are not in themselves a solution. The administration has flirted repeatedly with military options, and there is a grave risk that its interest in them may revive, despite the immense dangers. The prospects of destroying the nuclear arsenal – still less conventional stockpiles – would be low, the prospects of devastating repercussions for Seoul high and the chances of a wider destabilisation of the region significant...

However Jackson, the Victoria University analyst, doubts the efficacy of diplomacy. In Jackson’s analysis, “nothing much will change in the coming days and months unless 1) the US attacks; 2) the US imposes secondary sanctions on Chinese firms...; or 3) the US pivots its North Korea policy away from denuclearisation and figures out how to live with a nuclear-armed North Korea.”

Cyber warfare

The US has been keeping up a secret program of cyber attacks and other nonconventional warfare against North Korea since 2014, David Sanger and William Broad first reported in the New York Times in March.

“Advocates of the sophisticated effort to remotely manipulate data inside North Korea’s missile systems argue the United States has no real alternative because the effort to stop the North from learning the secrets of making nuclear weapons has already failed,” the journalists wrote. “The only hope now is stopping the country from developing an intercontinental missile, and demonstrating that destructive threat to the world.”

The problem with cyber attacks, electronic warfare and industrial sabotage, the authors noted, is that the arsenal “carries no guarantees” of effective prevention, as the world saw on Tuesday.

Military options

In response to the North Korean provocation, US and Korean forces undertook a joint live-fire missile exercise on Wednesday. A joint statement afterwards warning of possible military action.

“Self restraint, which is a choice, is all that separates armistice and war,” the statement said. “As this Alliance missile live fire shows, we are able to change our choice when so ordered by our Alliance national leaders. It would be a grave mistake for anyone to believe anything to the contrary.”

The military options on the table range from beefing up the South Korea-based THAAD (Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense), a wider attack on North Korea or even an attempt to assassinate the North Korean leader.

National security adviser HR McMaster appears to have moved in a matter of weeks toward military action. On 29 June, following the death of Warmbier and continued North Korean test activity, McMaster warned, “The threat is much more immediate now and so it’s clear that we can’t repeat the same approach – failed approach of the past.”

The Wall Street Journal editorial board openly urged regime change, writing: “Only a much tougher strategy aimed at toppling the Kim regime, with or without China’s help, has a chance of eliminating a threat that puts millions of American lives at risk. The best option is a comprehensive strategy to change the Kim regime, as former undersecretary of state Robert Joseph has argued.”

In contrast, Daniel Larison of the American Conservative wrote: “Seeking regime change in North Korea would be extremely dangerous and foolish. It would put millions of lives in jeopardy by risking war with the current regime. In the very unlikely event that this policy somehow ‘worked’ as intended, it would still create massive upheaval that would swamp South Korea with an unmanageable refugee crisis.”

Summarizing the situation in the Atlantic, Mark Bowden breaks down military options into either the complete devastation of Pyongyang or a “turn the screws” approach to hit selected reactors or nuclear test sites – attacks designed somehow to avoid all-out war. Bowden spoke with experts who said the “devastation” scenario was politically not feasible on a global scale and maybe not militarily doable anyway.

Bowden wrote:

Suppose that US forces could be positioned secretly, and that President Moon were on board. Suppose, further, that Pyongyang’s nukes could be disabled swiftly, its artillery batteries completely silenced, its missile platforms flattened, its leadership taken out—all before a counterstrike of any consequence could be made. And suppose still further that North Korea’s enormous army could be rapidly defeated, and that friendly casualties would remain surprisingly low, and that South Korea’s economy would not be significantly hurt. And suppose yet further that China and Russia agreed to sit on the sidelines and watch their longtime ally fall. Then Kim Jong Un, with his bad haircut and his legion of note-taking, big-hat-wearing, kowtowing generals, would be gone. South Korea’s fear of invasion from the North, gone. The menace of the state’s using chemical and biological weapons, gone. The nuclear threat, gone. Such a stunning outcome would be a mighty triumph indeed! It would be a truly awesome display of American power and know-how. What would be left? North Korea, a country of more than 25 million people, would be adrift.

In lieu of straightforward solutions to the North Korea conundrum, the US leadership has at times reverted to silence.

“The United States has spoken enough about North Korea,” US secretary of state Rex Tillerson said in a statement after a missile launch in early April. “We have no further comment.”

Missile experts have examined data from the test to analyse whether North Korea’s claim of being able to reach ‘anywhere in the world’ is true

What has North Korea claimed and why is it significant?

The regime claimed on Tuesday that it had conducted its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), and that the test had been a success. The missile was capable of reaching “anywhere in the world”, state TV reported.

The claim was verified by the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, who described the test as “a new escalation of the threat to the United States, our allies and partners, the region and the world”.

On Wednesday North Korean state TV claimed that the missile was capable of carrying a “large, heavy nuclear warhead” that could survive re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere – this has not been verified.

Nevertheless, the test offers more evidence that North Korea is moving closer to its eventual goal of possessing a nuclear-tipped missile that could strike the US mainland.

Such an eventuality would radically change the diplomatic dynamic and ratchet up pressure on the Trump administration to respond – remember that the US president has not ruled out a military response to serious provocations. It would also force the United Nations to rethink its approach to the hermit state.

What is an intercontinental ballistic missile?

An ICBM is a missile launched by a land-based system that is intended to carry nuclear payloads.

The most significant difference between an ICBM and other ballistic missiles is its greater range and speed – enabling countries to strike exceptionally distant targets with minimum warning.

To qualify as an ICBM, a missile must have a minimum range of 5,500km (3,400 miles).

What are experts saying about the North Korean claim?



Analysis by Japan and South Korea has supported the account given by North Korea’s Academy of Defence Science, which said the missile reached an altitude of 1,741 miles (2,802km) and flew 580 miles.

The US initially described it as an intermediate-range missile but later conceded it was an ICBM.

There is general agreement that this was Pyongyang’s most successful missile test since its ballistic missile programme gathered pace in the late 1990s. Less convincing is the North’s claim that the missile can reach any target in the world.

John Schilling, a missile expert at the 38 North thinktank in Washington, estimates it will take until at least 2020 for North Korea to be able to develop an ICBM capable of reaching the US mainland, and another 25 years before it will be able to build one powered by solid fuel.

How advanced is North Korea’s nuclear programme?

It is impossible to verify how far North Korea has come since it conducted the first of its six nuclear tests to date in 2006.

There are also doubts about the veracity of North Korean reports on its nuclear tests. It said its fifth test, in January 2016, had involved a powerful hydrogen device, but experts said the size of the explosion called that claim into question.

The US Institute for Science and International Security estimated that North Korea possessed between 13 and 21 nuclear weapons as of June last year, compared with 10 to 16 in 2014.

The Washington-based US-Korea Institute said in a 2015 report that the regime had enough fissile material to build anywhere from six to about 30 nuclear weapons, depending largely on how much highly enriched uranium it has produced.

South Korean officials have said that North Korea can mount a nuclear warhead on a medium-range missile capable of striking Japan and South Korea, including US military bases in those countries.

Why has the North Korean regime pursued a nuclear programme?

Much of the regime’s domestic legitimacy rests on portraying the country as under constant threat from the US and its regional allies, South Korea and Japan.

To support the claim that it is in Washington’s crosshairs, North Korea cites the tens of thousands of US troops lined up along the southern side of the demilitarised zone – the heavily fortified border dividing the Korean peninsula. Tensions rise every spring at the start of joint military drills involving US and South Korean forces. North Korea insists the drills are a rehearsal for an invasion.

Faced with what it says are US provocations, North Korea says it has as much right as any other state to develop a nuclear deterrent.

North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un is also aware of the fate of other dictators who lacked nuclear weapons or were forced to give them up.

What is Donald Trump’s policy towards Pyongyang?

Six months in to his presidency, Trump is struggling to articulate a coherent policy towards North Korea, except to say that he has dispensed with the sanctions and isolation – known as strategic patience – pursued under Barack Obama.

Trump invested heavily in China’s ability to use its diplomatic and economic clout to persuade North Korea to abandon its missile and nuclear programmes, but that approach has so far failed to pay dividends.

He has also threatened to use force against the North in response to serious provocations, but has not specified what constitutes his “red line”, or what form military retaliation might take. Any indication that the US was to resort to force would alarm South Korea and Japan.

To complicate matters, at his weekend summit in Washington with the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, Trump agreed to leave the door open to dialogue with North Korea “under the right conditions”.

How has South Korea’s policy towards the North changed since Moon Jae-in became president in May?

South Korean conservatives voiced concern that Moon, a liberal who supports engagement with North Korea, would prove a soft touch for hard-bitten military officials in Pyongyang.

Since taking office in May, however, Moon has combined cautious talk of greater inter-Korean cooperation with warnings that his administration would not tolerate more missile tests and other North Korean provocations.

On Tuesday, Moon urged North Korea to halt its missile launches, warning that he did not know what possible consequences the regime would face if it crossed what Moon called “the point of no return”.

Can anything be done to rein in North Korea’s nuclear ambitions?

At this point, the obvious response is no. A realistic answer to this question has evaded diplomats, nuclear experts and world leaders for years. Barack Obama left the White House with the Korean peninsula in an even more perilous situation than when he arrived eight years earlier.

A pre-emptive strike against North Korea’s nuclear facilities would almost certainly be met with immediate retaliation that could cause huge casualties in South Korea and possibly Japan.

The North’s demand that it enter into bilateral talks with the US, with a view to winning security guarantees from Washington, appears highly fanciful given its missile tests and the rhetoric from the White House.

The realisation may also be dawning in the US that the faith it has placed in China’s ability to talk sense into Pyongyang was misplaced. Beijing’s greatest fear is a crisis in North Korea that creates millions of refugees and ends with South Korean and US forces ranged across its border with North Korea.

As long as that remains the case, North Korea knows it can test Beijing’s patience and still emerge unscathed.

An animal rights group is calling for an end to New Zealand’s “barbaric” war on possums after joeys were drowned in a bucket of water at a school fundraiser.



It said children were becoming desensitised to violence as a result of the method of killing an animal that is considered a pest in New Zealand. “It was clearly inhumane, it was appalling that children were witnessing this violence,” said Jasmijn de Boo, chief executive of animal rights group Safe.

The killings took place during a North Island school’s annual possum hunt. The possum mothers had been shot and their fur and skins sold. It is illegal to wilfully or recklessly harm any wild animals – including possums – and every measure must be taken to euthanise possums as humanely as possible, with shooting being the preferred method.

Drowning baby possums? Hatred of invasive species has gone too far | Jules Howard Read more

De Boo said the recent drownings were not a one-off and that many more New Zealanders were supportive rather than shocked. “We’re concerned this will spill over to New Zealand children becoming more desensitised to other sentient beings, as there is good evidence that people who hurt animals are more likely to perpetrate domestic violence or violence against humans so we need to really take this issue seriously.”

A petition has been launched to ban school possum hunts which has garnered close to 9,000 signatures and will be delivered to the education minister, Nikki Kaye, when it reaches 10,000.



Possum hunting is a widespread and popular practice across both the North and the South islands, with both amateurs and professionals alike.

Do Boo accepted it was a difficult situation given the government pledged to wipe out the species (along with stoats, ferrets and rats) by 2050. “The conservation of birds is very important, and possums play a role in that but they have been demonised as pests for a long time,” de Boo said.

“The word ‘pests’ is problematic because it insinuates they are worthless objects that can be treated without care – run over, beaten, whatever. We need to get back to the idea that all animals are sentient beings and they do not deserve a cruel death – even possums.” Safe has suggested exploring more humane alternatives, such as mass sterilisation.

The Royal New Zealand Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) told the school the way it killed the joeys wasn’t humane, local media reported, and the school pledged to work with the SPCA in the future “to ensure that all animal welfare requirements are met”.

Australian brushtail possums were introduced to New Zealand in 1837 by settlers who hoped to establish a roaring trade in possum fur. However the animals quickly got out of control because they faced no natural predators in New Zealand.

They had a devastating impact on bird life, competing for food and habitat resources, and climbing into nests to eat eggs and fledglings. They also destroyed native trees with their strong paws, especially rata, totara, titoki, kowhai and kohekohe.

The president of Federated Farmers, Katie Milne, said the recent outcry was symptomatic of a growing cultural divide between rural and urban Kiwis, and it was “essential” to routinely cull possums to protect wildlife and stop the spread of bovine tuberculosis to farm animals.

Milne said the government culling of possums using trapping and poisoning methods had been “very effective” in recent years, and the native trees in her region on the west coast of the south island were beginning to return.

Poisoning possums is a controversial method in New Zealand because many of the most commonly used poisons – including 1080 – can take hours or even days to kill. “As a farmer I am used to being faced with life and death, and possum eradication is an essential part of farming life here and protecting the native New Zealand bush and birds,” Milne said. “But certainly the way those joeys were killed was not ideal and it could have been done in a better way. For farmers shooting is the best method.”

According to the New Zealand Fur Council possums consume 21,000 tons of New Zealand vegetation every day. About 1,500 people are employed in the possum fur and skin business, with the industry generating sales worth between $100m and $150m a year, and killing about 2m possums annually.

There have also been a number of forays into selling “possum pies” on the west coast of the south island, and possum meat is also used in pet food such as “possyyum”.

West coaster Chris Long, 25, started hunting possums when he was 12, and has paid for “one-and-a-half-trips around the the world” with his possum earnings, which on a good day can be up to NZ$700 ($510), or about 50 possums.

“I come from a place where hunting and fishing is normal, but I do feel sorry for the animals and I don’t enjoy killing them,” said Long, who says 5-10% of the trees within a 10km radius of his house have died from possum destruction, which has contributed to landslips in hilly areas.

“In Australia I’ve played with the possums and fed them and it is great fun. They are pretty cool animals. But in this country they are not quite so popular and they are a good form of income for me.”

The board of Māori Television has withdrawn the series Jonah from Tonga from screening on the channel.

New Zealand’s minister for Pacific peoples, Alfred Ngaro, said the series “perpetuates negative stereotypes of Pacific people” and “the fact it is pitched as comedy doesn’t make that any more acceptable”.

“It’s particularly disappointing to see this program being picked up within weeks of the Human Right’s Commission’s ‘Give nothing to racism’ campaign.”

Jonah from Tonga is an Australian television series written by and starring the comedian Chris Lilley. It follows a rebellious Australian boy of Tongan descent who had been introduced in Lilley’s 2007 series, Summer Heights High.

Georgina te Heuheu, the chair of Māori Television, said once the full board of became aware of the screening of the program on Thursday evening, a decision was made then to pull the series. She said the values of Maori Television include respecting all communities.

“We are a Māori media outlet with our own standards, and a mandate to protect and promote the Māori language and culture,” te Heuheu said. “This means that, as a leading indigenous broadcaster, we have a responsibility to present all cultures with a degree of respect and aroha not least those of our Pacific whanaunga.”

A replacement show, Te Taumata Kapahaka, will go to air next Thursday evening.

Alice Brine: I'm not whitesplaining why Jonah from Tonga is awful

SUPPLIED Chris Lilley's Jonah from Tonga.

OPINION: I'm a blue eyed, Caucasian, stand up comedian, and I've been asked to write an opinion piece about cultural appropriation - specifically, the recent decision made by Maori TV to broadcast Australian comedy-mockumentary, Jonah From Tonga.

Overall, my thoughts on this issue from a comedian's perspective is that Chris Lilley is a great actor and he can be hilarious - when playing a character that doesn't set a culture back by 1000 years.

From a cultural perspective, my opinion is that when a white person like me is given a platform to comment on cultural issues that are already being articulated and voiced by people within that culture, then it's my responsibility to hand that platform over. So that's what I am doing.

supplied Stuff columnist and comedian Alice Brine.

I reached out to fellow comedian James Nokise, and editor of Mana Magazine Leonie Hayden, and asked them for some their thoughts on this issue. Here's what they had to say:

* Alice Brine's Survivor: 30 thoughts I had while pretending to love this show

* Alice Brine's Survivor: The sexist world of Survivor

James Nokise:

"One of the big problems, probably the fundamental mistake, is that the satire and racial commentary - while strong - isn't strong enough to counter a white guy in black face being part of the joke. Chris has got some good gags in there, but there's always a part that will show him getting away with a taboo.

"The cynic in me thinks it's Maori TV trying to butter up their audience for Jimi Jackson doing blackface. You know? 'Overseas comics do it, why can't we?' And if Maori TV are comfortable setting that standard, who is meant to call them out in NZ?



"The best example in the show is actually when Chris plays a Chinese character trying to get on Home and Away - the gag is about representation, but if the chinese character had been trying to get on a popular comedy show, and a white actor took his place, it would show that Chris was aware."

Leonie Hayden (Ngāti Whātua o Kaipara):

"For me, there's no grey area when it comes to the representation of marginalised and minority voices: if you are not a part of that community, you can't speak for that community.

"So in that spirit I also can't say that this show shouldn't be watched or enjoyed by the Tongan community, nor would I begrudge any Pacific actors taking a role on the show.



"But I straight up don't find Jonah From Tonga funny. It's brown face. It's a collection of lazy stereotypes from the point of view of a dominant, demonstrably racist culture.



"It doesn't matter to me how sympathetic Chris Lilley thinks he's being by including Polynesian actors, or how snappy his one-liners are - what he's saying to Pacific kids living in Australia is 'your brown identity and body can be worn as a costume, as a joke'. No bueno.



"Also, I really don't think you can capture the nuances of a culture, and therefore its true comedic value, unless you're a part of it.



"You know what's funny to me about Māori culture? Kaumātua that nod off on the paepae and start gently snoring. Aunties that sing really loud and out of tune. Piling mattresses up on the marae and jumping off WWF-styles. Dick jokes in te reo… You know what I don't find funny? Jokes about being dumb and poor - you know, the lazy, embarrassing ones made by racist Pākehā people. Like Chris Lilley."

Alice Brine:

If you've not heard the phrase "mansplaining' before. I'm not sure if the phrase "whitesplaining" exists or not, but it's all I can think of when I consider the fact that I've been asked to write this opinion piece.

Whitesplaining, to me, is when a large group of people from non-white cultures are publicly and articulately voicing their opinion on a racial issue that impacts their culture and life, but then a white person comes along and is given public platform to patronisingly reiterate everything that cultural group are already saying.

Whitesplaining happens all too often in my opinion. It occurs when white people subconsciously and unknowingly believe that in order for a racial issue to be listened to by a group of people, it needs to come out of a white mouth. That's whitesplaining.

It's a counterproductive paradox and I'm not here for that. I'm not doing it. I'm not going to sit here on my white horse and talk about this as a cultural issue.

I'm happy to let it be known that I'm a huge Chris Lilley fan. I have been since my dad sent me the We Can Be Heroes DVD.

Chris Lilley has perfectly nailed the art of transforming himself into a completely different person. He can find the tiniest nuances from people's behaviour and turn them into hilarious comedic satire. I literally do not even know what he looks like in real life. I only know him as different comedy characters.

In particular my absolute favourite character is Pat Mullins from We Can Be Heroes. Pat was born with a disability. One of her legs is shorter than the other. As a result, she developed the ability to roll on her side at incredible speeds. With her beloved husband Terry as coach, Pat plans to roll on her side from Perth to Uluru.

Pat has me in stitches of laughter with every word.

When we watch Pat Mullins, we don't see her as a representative of a culture, we notice her as an individual. The reason we do this is because we are spoilt for choice with white people in mainstream media.

But, I'm starting to whitesplain, so that's enough from me.

Minister says Maori TV's Pacific stereotype comedy 'Jonah From Tonga' isn't funny

DATELINE PACIFIC/RNZ New Zealand's Māori Television will screen a controversial comedy series that has provoked criticism from Tongans living in the United States.

The Minister for Pacific Peoples, Alfred Ngaro, has criticised Maori Television's decision to air a controversial Australian comedy about a Tongan teenager.

The public broadcaster would start screening Jonah From Tonga on Thursday, and said the show was provocative satire rather than racist comedy.

But Ngaro said the show "perpetuates negative stereotypes of Pacific people," and said that "the fact it is pitched as comedy doesn't make that any more acceptable".

SUPPLIED Chris Lilley as Jonah from Tonga.

Jonah From Tonga is the sequel to mockumentary Summer Heights High. The show follows white comedian Chris Lilley as he plays 14-year-old Tongan boy Jonah Takalua. In the latter instalment, Jonah is sent to Tonga to get his life back on track after being expelled from school.

"It's particularly disappointing to see this programme being picked up within weeks of The Human Right's Commission's 'Give nothing to racism' campaign," said Ngaro.

ROBERT KITCHIN/FAIRFAX NZ Minister for Pacific Peoples Alfred Ngaro has spoken out against a controversial Australian comedy about a Tongan teenager.

Ngaro also questioned why Maori Television would screen Jonah From Tonga when there were already comedy shows made by Pacific Islanders available.

Maori Television head of content Mike Rehu said the show was "provocative", but that was the nature of comedy.

"It often involves satire and at times it can be challenging to some audiences particularly when actors are portraying characters from another culture," he said.

SUPPLIED The Tongan community in the US has lashed out at the Jonah From Tonga series.

In the show, Lilley dons a long-curly haired wig and dark brown makeup.

A statement from the Human Rights Commission called on Maori Television to consult the Tongan community before broadcasting the show because "while beloved by some, others find this character offensive". Rehu said they had done so.

"We viewed episodes of the series and consulted with members of the Tongan community prior to making a decision to screen the comedy," he said.

Will 'Ilolahia, a founder of the Polynesian Panthers, was consulted as part of the process. Maori Television asked him to get feedback from the community, where concerns were raised.

Ilolahia told the station there was agreement among the Tongan community in Auckland that the mockumentry was "concerning".

Maori Television said the Tongan Community surveyed also told Ilolahia they found the show entertaining.

Rehu said the programme fitted with Maori Television's mandate to strengthen te reo because it had the potential to attract audiences to the channel. In this case, Rehu said they were targeting "a young male audience" with Jonah From Tonga.

In the US, where Jonah From Tonga started screening in 2014, a petition to pull the show from HBO received more than 10,000 signatures. The Tongan American petition organisers said the show had "astounding inherent generalised racism".

"The show specifically targets and attempts to denigrate Tongan culture," said organisers Sione Latu and Jarom Vaha'.

As soon as the show launched, media commentators in Australia and America joined calls to stop broadcasting the show.

In a Huffington Post article, entitled: "Will HBO Give Platform to Racist Australian Brownface 'Mockumentary'?", writer Cleo Paskal took aim at Lilley for racial stereotyping, using derogatory terms and for donning "brownface".

"This racist teenaged pastiche is being played by Chris Lilley, a 39-year-old white guy, in a permed wig and brownface. Yes, brownface. In 2014," he wrote in the heavily shared article from 2014.

Jonah From Tonga airs on Maori Television at 9pm from Thursday.

Expensive apartments are failing to sell at the Shard, with speculation that its location in the south of the capital is the impediment. London is not the only city with a stark divide across its banks

Five years after the opening of “Europe’s first vertical city”, the luxury apartments of the Shard reportedly remain unsold. Why? Aside from the astronomical cost – the 10 flats in the 72-storey building are together valued at £199,250,000 – there is the location. As one luxury property agent put it: “Rich people don’t want to shell out zillions living south of the river. Nobody knows anyone who lives south of the river.”

High living, low sales: Shard apartments still empty, five years on Read more

So where did London’s intractable north/south divide come from and what other cities are geographically, culturally and socially separated by rivers?

London



The divide is as embedded in the city’s identity as the Thames. The notion of the north overseeing the south dates back to Emperor Claudius, who built Londinium on the north side of the river. Apparently, it was less marshy. For the 2,000 years since, north has lorded it over south.

Paris



The Left Bank of the Seine signifies artists and thinkers – Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and the Sorbonne – while the Right Bank stands for the establishment, all buttoned-up bankers, grand boulevards and opera houses. The split began in the middle ages when the Right Bank was the first to develop through trade. But these days it’s all about east and west ...

Dublin



The Northside and Southside of Dublin, separated by the Liffey, have long been divided by social class: the north historically poorer. But it wasn’t always this way. In the 18th century, the first exclusive Georgian houses for the wealthy Protestant Ascendancy class were built on the Northside. But by the late 19th century the upper classes migrated south, following the Earl of Kildare’s decision to build his palace in there, and the Northside Georgian addresses were repurposed as tenements housing multiple families.

Budapest



Less than 200 years ago Hungary’s capital was two cities, Buda and Pest, bifurcated by the mighty river Danube. Budapest’s split personality – a city both divided and then in 1873 united by the Danube – continues, with the left bank of the river (Buda) the more historic quarter with narrow streets, a castle atop a hill, and extraordinary architecture. The right bank (Pest) is more modern, hip, flat and industrial.

Mostar



Bosnia’s world-famous Old Bridge united the people – Catholic Croats and Bosniaks (Muslim Bosnians) – on either shore of Mostar’s Neretva river for centuries, making it the most ethnically integrated city in the former Yugoslavia. But the Balkan war destroyed the bridge and, despite it being rebuilt in 2004, Mostar continues to be a city divided, with two phone networks, electricity companies, postal service and school systems.

A parent whose baby has been given a health card that does not specify a gender – believed to be a world first – has said the aim is to allow the child to discover their gender on their own.

“I think we’re starting to understand that gender identity is not directly attached to genitals,” Kori Doty, a non-binary trans person who does not identify as male or female, told the Guardian in an interview.

“I don’t want to put them in a box where they only get to wear pink and ruffles or they only get to wear blue and trucks. I’m just trying to leave that space open, so that when they can say who they are, that they don’t have to say ‘your guess was wrong.’”

Canadian authorities have issued baby Searyl Atli a health card that does not specify male or female in what campaigners describe as a victory in the fight to have gender omitted from government documents.

I know what it's like to be a trans teen at school. Here's how to deal with the bullying | Aimee Challenor Read more

But since giving birth to Searyl at a friend’s home in November, Doty is still fighting to have the baby’s gender kept off the birth certificate. The fight is part of a broader, years-long push. Doty is one of eight trans and intersex individuals who have filed a human rights complaint against their home province of British Columbia, pointing to their personal experiences to allege that it is discriminatory to publish gender markers on birth certificates.

At the heart of their complaint is the presumption that only two genders exist and that babies must be slotted into one of these at birth, regardless of what gender identity they might develop later in life. Doing so leaves some struggling to contend with incorrect assumptions made about them at birth while others face a logistical nightmare of carrying identification that fails to accurately reflect who they are. In 2015, the human rights tribunal of British Columbia agreed to hear their complaint.

“I think really this is about recognising a structure, or a system, that is violating everyone,” said Doty, 31. “The binary gender system causes problems for everyone, including people that find ways to fit and conform in it. It is a disservice to all.”

Doty would instead like to have gender seen as part of a spectrum – a view that would not only benefit trans and intersex people but “also every boy who is cut off from their emotional wellbeing and told to suck it up and not cry and enculturated into toxic masculinity,” said Doty. “It also serves every girl who is told she shouldn’t want to make things or be good at math or be strong.”

After Searyl was born, the province refused to issue the child a birth certificate, pointing to the requirement that gender be noted on the document. In response Doty filed a legal challenge, citing the protection of gender expression in the provincial human rights code as well as in the Canadian Human Rights Act.

Recently the province issued Searyl a health card marked with a U for gender – assumed by Doty to mean undetermined or unassigned – allowing the child access medical care. Despite the card arriving without explanation or comment from the ministry, Doty described it as a victory but noted: “It’s just not the end of the game.”



Without a birth certificate, Searyl is listed as a non-citizen in the province’s system. The court case is expected to be heard in late autumn, said barbara findlay, a human rights lawyer who chooses to spell her name without capital letters and is working with Doty on the court challenge.

“There used to be a reason to put sex on birth certificates. You used to need to know that because only men could vote, only men could own property, only men could sit in the Senate, and so on. Those days are long gone,” said findlay. “And just as we used to have race on birth certificates, but we don’t any more, it’s time to take sex off birth certificates and treat it, like race, as a private matter.”

As Doty pushes forward with the case, the parent has heard from both supporters and detractors. “I know that I’m being discussed in men’s rights activist forums, I know that there are articles written about me and the way that my parenting practices are tantamount to abuse.”

But the cost of doing nothing is too high, said Doty, pointing to polls that suggest as many as 40% of transgender people in the US have attempted suicide at some point in their lives. “I want to raise my kid in such a way that whatever their gender is, it doesn’t have to give them angst.”

While the health card was a step forward, the ultimate goal is to have gender markers taken off all government documents, said Doty. “We’re talking about what is essentially a large-scale systemic change. Not just in the way that offices that issue documents function, but also in the way that our culture understands who we are, to ourselves and to each other,” Doty added. “That kind of change, it isn’t a one-step game.”

Theodore Kyriakou’s garides saganaki

For this classic Greek saganaki recipe you need fresh medium-to-large-sized prawns, which are deglazed in ouzo to give a unique taste.

When I think of saganaki, I taste salty melted cheese with hints of ouzo and plenty of grilled bread, and then I start daydreaming about eating under the Almyrikia trees, my feet in the sea.

The word “saganaki” refers to the cooking pan, a flat little frying pan with squat handles on both sides. It looks like a cross between a tawa and karahi, the equivalents from East Asia.

Serves 4 as a starter

prawns 12

tomatoes 4 good size, ripe and juicy, peeled

olive oil 80ml

banana shallot 1, peeled and finely chopped

garlic 2 cloves, chopped

Aleppo pepper a pinch

salt and freshly ground pepper

ouzo 70ml, or dry white wine

feta 200g, crumbled

basil ¼ bunch

oregano a pinch

Peel the bodies of the prawns, leaving the heads and tails on for extra flavour. De-vein by making a very shallow cut along the back of the prawn with a sharp knife, just enough to be able to see the vein and remove it.

Grate the tomatoes into a bowl, using the large blades of the grater. Grate only the flesh and discard the skin. Let them strain in a colander, so that no excess water is added to the sauce.

In a saucepan, heat 50ml of olive oil over medium heat, add the diced shallot and saute until it looks translucent. Stir in the chopped garlic and Aleppo pepper, and season with salt and pepper. Add the chopped tomatoes, cover with the lid, bring to the boil and let simmer for about 5-10 minutes, until the sauce thickens and all water has evaporated.

Preheat the oven to 220C/gas mark 7.

Season the prawns with salt on both sides. Heat a large frying pan over medium heat and pour in 20ml olive oil. Add the prawns, saute for 1 minute on each side and deglaze with the ouzo until it almost evaporates. Your ingredients might catch on fire since this is flambéing – watch it carefully but don’t panic, as it should quickly die down.

Pour the tomato sauce over the prawns and shake the pan to cover all ingredients evenly. Press them down gently with your fingers to sink into the sauce. Top it with the crumbled feta, place the pan in the oven and cook for 5 more minutes, until the feta slightly melts.

Shred the basil. Sprinkle it over together with the remaining olive oil and the oregano and serve while still hot with plenty of crusty baguette.

Claudia Roden’s megadarra – brown lentils and rice

In Syria, it was called mudardara, but for us in Egypt it was megadarra. Accompanied by yogurt, it was a regular part of traditional Jewish dairy meals on Thursday nights, and on Saturdays it was eaten cold. It may seem that the recipe calls for a large amount of onions – but when they are crisp and brown and caramelised it will seem that there are not enough.

Serves 4-6

onions 3 large, weighing about 750g, cut in half and sliced

olive oil 125ml

large brown lentils 250g

long-grain rice 250g

salt about 1 tsp

pepper

Fry the onions in oil, stirring often, until they turn a rich golden brown.

Rinse the lentils and cook them in 1 litre of water for 20 minutes. Now add half the fried onions and rice. Season with salt and pepper and stir well. Put the lid on and cook on very low heat for another 20 minutes, or until the rice and lentils are tender, adding water if it becomes too dry.

At the same time, put the remaining onions back on the fire and continue to fry them, stirring often, until they are a dark brown and almost caramelised.

Serve the rice hot or at room temperature with these onions sprinkled on top.

Sam and Sam Clark’s quail stuffed with couscous, raisins and almonds

One mouthful of this dish and you know it could come only from Morocco. It tastes heavenly!

Serves 4-6

free-range or organic quails 8, rinsed under cold water and drained

olive oil 3 tbsp

cinnamon stick 1

saffron a small pinch (about 30 threads)

red onion 1 small, roughly chopped

golden sultanas a handful

ground cinnamon 1½ tsp

runny honey 1 dsp

caster sugar ½ tsp

sea salt and black pepper

For the couscous stuffing

fine couscous 375g

sunflower oil 3 tbsp

golden raisins 300g, soaked for 10 minutes in hot water

almonds 150g, soaked for 10 minutes in hot water and roughly chopped

butter 60g

ground cinnamon 2¼ tsp

crushed sweet almonds 1 quantity (see below)

runny honey 1½ tbsp

icing sugar ½ tbsp

orange-blossom water 1½ tsp

For the crushed sweet almonds

olive oil 10 tbsp

almonds 250g, whole, blanched

granulated sugar 5 tbsp

To make the crushed sweet almonds, place a frying pan over a medium heat and add the oil. When hot but not smoking, add the almonds and stir around until lightly toasted (light brown, approximately 2-3 minutes). Take care not to make them too dark as they will be bitter and unusable (the almonds will carry on cooking a bit out of the oil). Remove the pan from the heat and spoon the almonds on to a piece of kitchen paper to absorb any excess oil. Transfer about 200g of the almonds to a mortar along with the sugar, and crush until the nuts are almost fine. Alternatively, do this in a food processor, but make sure the almonds are not too smooth. Reserve the extra 50g almonds whole for decorating the dish.

For the stuffing, place the couscous in a bowl and pour over the sunflower oil. Mix well, then cover with cold water. When the water has been absorbed (5-10 minutes), delicately work with the palms of your hands to make the couscous light and fluffy, breaking up any lumps as you go. Fill the bottom half of a couscousier or steamer a third full with water and put on a high heat to boil. Turn down the heat to a steady simmer, and put on the top half of the pan. Gently scatter a layer of couscous 5mm thick on the bottom, wait for 1 minute, then add a second layer. Wait for 5-10 minutes until the steam beings to rise above the two layers of couscous, then put on the rest. Steam for 10 minutes.

Put the hot couscous in a bowl and season with salt. Add the raisins, soaked almonds and butter. Cover the butter with some of the hot couscous so that it melts, then add the ground cinnamon, 200g of the crushed sweet almonds, the honey, icing sugar and orange-blossom water. Mix well, add a little salt and pepper and taste to check the seasoning. Put some of this stuffing inside the cavity of each quail and a little under the skins. Secure the open cavity of the tail with foil or a couple of wooden toothpicks and brush off any excess stuffing. You will be left with sufficient stuffing to serve on the side.

To cook the quails, choose a saucepan that will fit the eight birds snugly, and put over a medium heat. Add the olive oil and, when hot but not smoking, add the cinnamon stick, saffron and chopped onion. Season with salt and pepper, then add the quails breast-side down and enough water almost, but not quite, to cover them. Bring to a steady simmer and cook for about 30 minutes, turning once halfway through the cooking time. At this stage preheat the oven to 230C/gas mark 8. When the birds are cooked, transfer them to a baking dish (keep the cooking liquor aside) and place in the hot oven until golden, a few minutes. Meanwhile, add the sultanas and ground cinnamon to the cooking liquor and reduce for 10-15 minutes. Then add the honey and sugar. Check for seasoning. You should taste a balance between the savouriness of the stewed quail, the sweetness of the honey and the spice.

When the quails are golden, warm up the couscous left over from the stuffing and serve on the side with the hot sauce (spoon a little of the sauce over the quail just before serving). Sprinkle the remaining whole lightly roasted almonds on the couscous for an attractive finish.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Corsican pie with courgette flowers. Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer

You can use a wide range of wild, cultivated or supermarket greens in this recipe. Consider nettles, beetroot tops, turnip tops, spinach or watercress in place of the chard. Choose the ones you like most. The courgette flowers look wonderful but you can leave them out or substitute them with some long shaved strips of courgette, if you prefer. Brocciu, produced on the island of Corsica and considered a national food, is a fresh young white cheese made with goat’s or ewe’s milk. I couldn’t omit it from the ingredients, but the easier-to-find Italian ricotta can be used just as well instead.

Serves 4 as a main course

red onion ½ small (85g), thinly sliced

celery stalks with leaves 3 (220g), thinly sliced

swiss chard leaves 8 large (175g), white stalks discarded, roughly chopped

garlic 2 cloves, thinly sliced

mint leaves 2 tbsp, torn

parsley 2 tbsp, chopped

sage 2 tsp, chopped

olive oil 2 tbsp, plus extra for brushing

feta 75g, crumbled

pecorino 50g, finely grated

pine nuts 15g, lightly toasted

lemon grated zest of 1

all-butter puff pastry 350g

plain flour for dusting

brocciu cheese 100g, or ricotta

courgette flowers 4-6, cut in half lengthways if large, or 6 long, shaved strips of raw courgette (optional)

egg 1, lightly beaten

salt and black pepper

Place a large saute pan on medium–high heat and saute the onion, celery, chard, garlic, mint, parsley and sage in the olive oil. Cook, stirring continuously, for 15 minutes or until the greens have wilted and the celery has softened completely. Remove from the heat and stir through the feta, pecorino, pine nuts, lemon zest, ¼ teaspoon of salt and a hearty grind of black pepper. Leave aside to cool.

Preheat the oven to 220C/gas mark 7.

Roll out the pastry on a floured work surface until 3mm thick, then cut it into a circle, approximately 30cm in diameter. Place on an oven tray lined with baking parchment. Spread the filling out on the pastry leaving a 3cm border all the way around. Dot the filling with large chunks of brocciu or ricotta and top with courgette flowers or courgette strips, if using. Bring the pastry up around the sides of the filling and pinch the edges together firmly to form a secure, decorative lip over the edge of the tart. Alternatively, press with the end of a fork. Brush the pastry with egg and refrigerate for 10 minutes.

Bake the tart for 30 minutes, until the pastry is golden and cooked on the base. Remove from the oven and brush with a little olive oil. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Richard Olney’s Provençal fish stew

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Provençal fish stew. Photograph: Martin Poole for the Observer

Bouillabaisse is, to tell the truth, more of a philosophy than a culinary preparation. More gastronomic literature – and quarrels – have centered around it than any other dish (with cassoulet running a close second). If most of the recipes for it were to be followed, however, the result could only be the most banal of fish soups (I am thinking of those in French – some that I have seen in American and English cookbooks would make the hair of the most indifferent Marseillais stand on end).

It is not a delicate dish; to be good, it must be highly seasoned, and it is terrifyingly soporific, but it embodies and engenders the warmth, the excitement and the imagination which, perhaps, of all the Mediterranean peoples, the Provençaux exude in the highest degree. At best, it belongs to the realm of divine things.

There is a perpetual quarrel as to whether soupe de poissons (literally, soup of fish) or bouillabaisse (which is a soupe aux poissons, or soup with fish) is the finest dish. This is essentially debated among professional eaters and writers on food who are not experts on the technical side of things, for any professional chef knows (though rarely tells) that a really good soupe aux poissons is moistened, not with water, but with a fish stock, which is nothing more nor less than a soupe de poissons. Another detail little discussed by its practitioners is the addition of a bit of pastis, an anise-flavoured apéritif alcohol similar to absinthe. It serves admirably to reinforce the perfume of the fennel in the dish.

A number of circumstantial factors are, no doubt, essential for this fish soup to be translated into a memorable experience. It should be the main dish – and plentiful; it should be shared with friends in a relaxed and informal atmosphere; it marries well with the sea air (in any case, the proximity of the ocean tends to ensure the freshness of the fish); the wine should be kept generously flowing throughout the meal. I, personally, have many sublime memories of entire days devoted to shopping (early in the morning to the fish market to find the freshest of fish of the greatest possible variety), everyone preparing fish and vegetables (accompanied by a few more pastis than wisdom would ordinarily dictate), followed by euphoric hours spent at table.

The following is a list of fish used traditionally in bouillabaisse, with English translation where possible (although some may be unobtainable in English-speaking countries), and possible substitutes:

Rascasse: the one fish considered absolutely indispensable. No translation. Substitute red snapper.

Vive: weaver. It is a sand-burrowing shore fish. Substitute whiting.

Girelle: I find no translation for this gloriously coloured fish, and a substitution is difficult. Although it is a close relative of the zander, also known as the pike-perch.

St Pierre: John Dory. A ferocious-looking fish of very delicate flesh. Substitute grey sole or lemon sole.

Congre: conger eel. [This now listed as endangered. Use gurnard instead.]

Baudroie or lotte: angler-fish. Substitute sea bass, fresh haddock or fresh cod.

Rouget: red mullet. The Mediterranean rock mullet (rouget des roches) is far finer than any other.

Favouilles: small crabs. Substitute soft-shelled crabs.

Mussels are often added and one often finds langouste (rock lobsters) added for elegance’s sake, but neither the lobster nor the soup gains in this marriage.

The following recipe is entitled noncommittally soupe aux poissons, out of respect for those purist defenders of the true bouillabaisse, which is prepared with fish to be found only on the rocky Mediterranean shores, moistened only with water, and accompanied by la rouille, a highly flavoured pommade made by pounding together cayenne pepper and raw garlic, and adding olive oil (some mount it, like a mayonnaise, with egg yolks). Generally speaking, the qualities essential to the success of the dish given here are a variety of absolutely fresh fish (at least 5 or 6 different kinds, some of the firm gelatinous flesh, others of tender white flesh – avoid, above all, any strongly flavoured oily fish such as sardines or mackerel), a very good quality fruity olive oil, and a rapid boil (the word bouillabaisse means “boil at top speed”). This rapid boiling, by forming a light emulsion of the oil in the cooking liquid, thickens the soup. If some of the suggested fish are unavailable, substitute others and don’t worry about it.

Serves 6-8

mixed whole fish 1.8kg of medium size (150-275g), such as small red snappers, grey sole, lemon sole, mullet, whiting, wall-eyed pike, etc

sea bass, fresh cod, halibut, etc 450g, cut into thick slices

conger eel [use gurnard] 450g, cut into slices approximately 4cm thick

soft-shelled crabs 450g

olive oil 350g

branches of wild fennel (or lacking these, fennel seed), bay leaf, thyme, savory, oregano

powdered saffron approximately ½ tsp

whole saffron a good pinch

pastis, Pernod 51 or Ricard 1 small glass

leeks 450g

onions 3 medium

garlic 4-5 cloves

water approximately 3.5 litres

fish carcasses 450g (ask your fish merchant for carcasses from fish that have been filleted - these replace, albeit imperfectly, the little “soup fish” used on the Mediterranean coast)

dried orange peel

salt (preferably coarse sea salt-or, if near the ocean, sea water diluted to the right saltiness)

tomatoes 700g firm, well-ripened

freshly ground pepper

French bread about 20 slices, dried out, either in the sun or in a very slow oven, but not toasted

garlic 6-7 cloves, with which to rub the bread

Cut off the fins, remove the gills and scale and clean the fish that are whole, if this has not been done for you. The heads may be removed or not – the presentation is more attractive if the heads remain, but the fish stock is thus impoverished. Trim the slices of larger fish to make them more presentable and put aside the trimmings with the heads and carcasses. Sponge all the fish and seafood, dry with paper towels, spread them out on a large platter and sprinkle them thoroughly with some of the olive oil, then with the herbs, about ⅓ teaspoon of powdered saffron, and finally with half the pastis. Gently rub the fish in your hands, inside and out, until they are all equally yellowed by the saffron, then leave to marinate, turning them around from time to time, while preparing the fish stock and vegetables.

For the fish stock, cut off the tough, dark-green parts of the leeks and discard them. Slit the remaining parts halfway down to facilitate washing them and, when they are well washed, cut each in 2, in order to separate the greenish parts from the white of the leek. Put the white parts aside and coarsely chop the green parts. Peel the onions, put 2 aside and coarsely chop the third. Crush the 4-5 cloves of garlic.

Heat the water and add the heads, carcasses and trimmings of the fish, chopped leek greens, chopped onion, crushed garlic, a branch of fennel (or seeds), dried orange peel, thyme, bay leaf, and salt. Bring to a boil and cook, covered, over a medium flame, for approximately ½ hour. After 15-20 minutes, crush all of the solid material with a wooden pestle. Pour the contents of the pot into a fine sieve and press the debris well with pestle or wooden spoon in order to extract all the flavour possible.

Dip the tomatoes in boiling water for a moment to loosen their skins, peel them, cut them in 2 horizontally and squeeze them to rid them of seeds and excess liquid. Chop the white parts of the leeks and the remaining onions finely.

Pour the remaining oil (there should be approximately 160ml) into a very large saucepan (the fishermen in the south of France use a large galvanised tin basin, the same form as a dishpan – if you have no suitable saucepan, an enameled dishpan will serve). Put the chopped leeks and onions to cook gently in the oil, stirring them regularly with a wooden spoon, and, 10 minutes later, add the chopped tomatoes, a pinch of powdered saffron, a pinch of whole saffron (the powdered, assuming it to be pure good-quality saffron, lends more flavour, and the whole saffron lends a decorative aspect) and a piece of dried orange peel. Continue to cook for another 5 minutes or so, salt lightly (bearing in mind that the fish stock has already been salted to taste) and add a generous amount of freshly ground pepper. Place the pan over the highest possible flame and add the fish stock and the remaining pastis. From this moment count 15 minutes’ cooking time. The liquid should be kept at a rapid boil and the pan uncovered. The fish should be added at 3 different intervals; those of firm and somewhat gelatinous flesh should be added first along with any crustaceans; 5 or 6 minutes later, the larger specimens of the more tender-fleshed varieties; and 5 minutes after that, the smallest of the soft-fleshed fish. This timing is inevitably somewhat arbitrary, everything depending on the variety, the size, and the kind of fish used. Sometimes only 2 intervals rather than 3 are needed, and it may be that 10 or 12 minutes’ cooking time is sufficient.

During the time that the fish is cooking, rub the dried-out bread slices with 6-7 cloves of garlic. Count 1 medium-sized clove for 3 slices of bread.

Lift out the fish carefully with a large wire skimming spoon and arrange on a heated serving platter. Moisten them with 2 or 3 ladlefuls of broth and pour the remainder into a soup tureen. Send the fish and the soup to the table at the same time, accompanied by the garlic-flavoured crusts, and serve, first, a ladleful of soup poured over a garlic crust, and after, the fish, moistened with an additional ladleful of soup for each guest.

Sarit Packer and Itamar Srulovich’s pomegranate molasses chicken with bulgar salad

This is a good one to make when people come round, as it is really hard not to like – sweet and sour, plenty of textures, pretty colours and virtually everybody likes chicken. Using chicken thighs here makes it almost impossible to dry the meat out and ensures plenty of chicken flavour to come through the strong marinade.

Dinner for 4

vegetable oil 1 tbsp, for frying

chicken thigh fillets 8, skin removed

For the marinade

garlic 2 cloves, peeled and sliced

green chilli ½-1 (depending how hot you like it), sliced

pomegranate molasses 3 tbsp

vegetable oil 1 tbsp

freshly ground black pepper ½ tsp

For the salad

bulgar wheat 200g

salt ½ tsp

olive oil 1 tsp

boiling water 200ml

shelled pistachios 50g, roasted and coarsely chopped, half reserved to sprinkle on top

currants 75g

dried mint 2 tsp

pomegranate molasses 1 tbsp

fresh pomegranate seeds 50g, 1 tbsp reserved to sprinkle over the top

mint 1 small bunch (about 15-20g), roughly chopped

parsley 1 small bunch (about 15-20g), roughly chopped

Mix the marinade ingredients together and use to coat the chicken all over.

Cover and keep in the fridge for a minimum of 2 hours to marinate. You can start the meat marinating up to 48 hours in advance – just leave it in the fridge until you are ready to start cooking.

Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6.

Place the bulgar wheat in a bowl with the salt and oil, pour over the boiling water and cover with cling film for 5 minutes. Uncover and fluff up the bulgar using a fork.

Add all the remaining salad ingredients except those you have reserved to use as garnish, and stir well.

Heat the vegetable oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat and place the chicken thighs smooth-side down in it. Season with salt and pepper and fry for 2-3 minutes until the thighs go a lovely dark golden colour, then flip them over and cook for a further 2 minutes. Place the frying pan in the oven for 12 minutes, by which time the chicken should be cooked through.

Spoon the salad onto individual plates or a large serving platter and top with the chicken and the juices that have accumulated in the frying pan. Sprinkle with the reserved pistachios and pomegranate seeds to garnish.

Marcella Hazan’s white clam sauce

Facebook Twitter Pinterest White clam sauce. Photograph: Martin Poole for the Observer

Everywhere in Venice – or in Italy for that matter – one can eat spaghetti with clams, but none tastes like the dish that Cesare Benelli makes at Al Covo, the restaurant he owns with his Texan wife, Diane. Cesare’s genial variation on this timeless theme consists of holding back the natural juices of the just-opened clams, draining the pasta while it is still underdone and finishing cooking it in a frying pan together with the clam juice. The pasta, by the time it becomes fully cooked, drinks up all the fresh clam juices, achieving a density and richness of flavour no other version of the dish can match.

Serves 4

clams 18, live, in their shells

extra virgin olive oil 5 tbsp

garlic 2 large cloves, peeled and sliced paper thin

parsley 1½ tbsp, chopped

hot red chilli pepper 2 tsp (or to taste), chopped

plum tomato 1, fresh, ripe, firm, cut into 1cm dice with its skin on, but drained of juice and all seeds removed

dry white wine 100ml

pasta 450g (see note below)

fresh basil leaves 6, torn into 2 or 3 pieces

Soak the clams for 5 minutes in a basin or sink filled with cold water. Drain and refill the basin with fresh cold water, leaving in the clams. Vigorously scrub the clams one by one with a very stiff brush. Drain, refill the basin and repeat the whole scrubbing operation. Do this 2 or 3 more times, always in fresh changes of water, until you see no more sand settling to the bottom of the basin. Discard those that stay open when handled. Put them in a pan broad enough so that the clams don’t need to be piled up more than 3 deep, cover the pan, and turn the heat to high. Check the clams frequently, turning them over and removing them from the pan as they open their shells.



When all the clams have opened up and you have taken them out of the pan using a slotted spoon, detach the clam meat from the shells and gently swish each piece in the pan juices to rinse off any sand. Try not to stir up the juices in the pan any more than you must. Unless the clams are exceptionally small, cut them into 2 or even 3 pieces. Put them in a small bowl pour 2 tablespoons olive oil over them, cover the bowl tightly with cling film, and set it aside for later, but do not refrigerate.

Line a strainer with kitchen paper and filter the clam juices in the pan through the paper into another bowl. Set aside for later.

Choose a frying or saute pan broad enough to contain the pasta later. Put in 3 tablespoons of olive oil and the sliced garlic, and turn the heat to medium-high. Cook the garlic, stirring it, for just a few seconds without letting it become coloured, then add the parsley and the chilli pepper. Stir once or twice, and add the diced tomato. Cook the tomato for 1-2 minutes, stirring it from time to time, then add the wine. Simmer the wine for about 20-30 seconds, letting it reduce, then turn the heat off.

Cook the pasta in abundant salted boiling water until it is very firm to the bite, barely short of being fully cooked. When you bite a piece off, it should feel slightly stiff and the narrowest of chalk-white cores should be showing in the centre of the strand.

Turn the heat on to high under the frying or saute pan, drain the pasta and transfer it immediately to the pan. Add all the filtered clam juice and cook, tossing and turning the pasta, until all the juice has evaporated.

If the pasta was not too underdone when you drained it, it should now be perfectly cooked. Taste it and, in the unlikely event it needs more cooking after the clam juices have evaporated and been absorbed, add a small amount of water.

As soon as the pasta is done, before you turn the heat off, add the cut up clams with all the oil in the bowl and the torn basil leaves, toss in the pan 2 or 3 times, then transfer to a warm platter and serve at once.

Note on pasta

Spaghettini takes to clam sauces more successfully than other shapes. A close enough second is spaghetti. If you should want to use fresh homemade fettuccine instead of spaghettini, bear in mind that it will cook much faster than boxed, dry, factory-made pasta. Before cooking it, put the clam juice in the frying pan and boil away half of it, so that when you add the fettuccine to the pan it will take less time to cook down all the juice.

Marianna Leivaditaki’s Cretan pies with slow-cooked lamb, aubergine and sheep’s cheese bechamel

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Cretan pies with slow-cooked lamb, aubergine and sheep’s cheese bechamel. Photograph: Martin Poole for the Observer

This is a recipe that most will recognise as the ingredients are very similar to that of moussaka; a dish eaten and loved by many. Slow-cooked lamb scented with warm spices, sweet fried aubergines and creamy bechamel make these pies an irresistible snack.

For me, making the filo pastry in exactly the way I was taught as a child is something I love. Because of the amount of olive oil in the dough, when fried these pies puff up and are full of air pockets and crunchiness. You bite into them and the rich, aromatic filling is just so delicious and moreish they simply make you smile.

The pies are usually eaten like a snack in the same way that you would eat a pasty. However, they also go very well with a chopped tomato and fresh mint salad simply seasoned with olive oil and sea salt.

Makes approx 15 pies

For the lamb

olive oil 50ml

lamb shoulder 500g, off the bone, cut into bite-size chunks

red onion 300g, finely diced

fresh tomatoes 500g, roughly chopped

red wine 200ml

cinnamon stick 1

ground cloves ½ tsp

ground black pepper ½ tsp

salt to taste

For the pastry

plain flour 500g

olive oil 250ml

vinegar 1 tsp

salt 1 tsp

warm water around 250ml

For the aubergines

aubergines 600g, cut into thick slices and salted

vegetable or olive oil for deep frying (use the same oil to fry the aubergines and then the pies)

For the bechamel

butter 70g

plain flour 1 tbsp

milk 300ml

hard sheep’s cheese 150g, grated

Heat a saucepan over medium heat, add the olive oil and the lamb and brown on both sides. Add the onions, tomatoes, wine, spices and salt, and mix. Adjust the seasoning if necessary. Cover the ingredients with a sheet of parchment paper and a lid and cook for about 30 minutes or until the meat is tender and the sauce is thick.

For the pastry, place the flour in a bowl and add the olive oil, vinegar and salt. Start adding warm water slowly while kneading the dough. You usually need a similar amount to that of the olive oil. Stop adding water when your dough is soft and silky. Don’t over-knead the dough; stop as soon as you have a dough that is workable. Place in a bowl and let it rest for 15-20 minutes.

Make the bechamel by caramelising the butter in a small pan until it is golden. Add the flour and whisk vigorously for a minute. Add the milk and cheese and cook gently until the sauce thickens.

Deep fry the aubergines in a pan until golden brown.

To make the pies, split the dough into two. Roll out the pastry as thinly as you can without breaking it. Cut out round discs using a plate (approx 16cm in diameter).

Mix together the lamb, aubergines and bechamel in a bowl.

Place about one tablespoon of the filling onto one half of the pastry and fold the other half over to seal the pie and create a half-moon shape. Seal the pies using the end of a fork to pinch both sides together.

Fry the pies in olive or vegetable oil until golden brown on both sides.

Serve immediately.

Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi’s cardamom rice pudding with pistachios and rose water

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Cardamom rice pudding with pistachio and rose water. Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer

Rachela Shrefler, now in her seventies, came to Jerusalem from Iran as a child and later met her husband, Ezra Shrefler, a Turkish-Kurdish Jew. They are both cooks and own Azura, a restaurant in Machne Yehuda market. Among the many pots Rachela has on the stove on a Friday for the Saturday “raid” — when dozens of hungry family members descend on their house — is a pot with rice pudding. The rice sits on the hot platter until Saturday morning, when the family members sit together and eat it. It is simple and delicious, containing only rice, milk and sugar, with a dusting of ground cinnamon.

Rice pudding was the most common everyday dessert throughout the old Sephardi world, with variations according to community, and was eaten hot or cold, at various times of the day. Possible additions would be honey, saffron, mastic, cinnamon and other sweet spices.

Rice pudding is also common in Arab homes. Sami’s mother used to prepare it on occasion, causing the kids to go into clashes over the caramelised bits that formed at the bottom of the pot. They would have it with sugar syrup flavoured with flower blossom.

Serves 4

full-fat milk 400ml

double cream 120ml

vanilla pod 1, seeds scraped

cardamom pods 8, lightly crushed

pudding rice 120g

unsalted butter 30g, diced

condensed milk 2 tbsp

acacia honey 1 tbsp, or another mild-flavoured honey

salt

unsalted pistachios 3 tbsp, roasted and slivered or lightly crushed, to garnish

dried edible rose petals 1 tbsp, to garnish

For the syrup

acacia honey 1 tbsp or another mild-flavoured honey

rose water ½ tbsp

Put the milk, cream, vanilla (pod and seeds) and cardamom in a medium saucepan and place on a high heat. As soon as the mix is about to reach boiling point, remove from the heat, allow to cool down and leave in the fridge to infuse overnight, or at least a couple of hours.

To prepare the syrup, stir the honey, rose water and 1 teaspoon of water well until the honey dissolves and set aside.

Add the rice to the pan with the infused milk and cream, bring to the boil and simmer on a medium heat, stirring all the time, for 20 minutes. The rice should cook through but still retain a bite and the pudding should be thick. You will need to add a little bit of water, up to 50ml, towards the end of the cooking if the pudding becomes too thick before the rice is done.

Remove the pan from the heat and carefully pick out the cardamom pods and vanilla pod. Stir in the butter, condensed milk, honey and a pinch of salt. You can chill the mix now (and re-heat in a microwave oven later) or serve immediately in little flat bowls, sprinkled with pistachios and rose petals and drizzled with the syrup.

Omar Allibhoy’s arroz al horno – baked rice with pork ribs and sausage

This dish is even more popular in Valencia than paella and all my friends from the Mediterranean side of Spain say that it’s Granny’s star dish for family gatherings. It is worth using a terracotta pot to cook the entire recipe as it captures all the flavours from beginning to end, but you can use a pan or oven tray instead.

Serves 4

chicken, pork or beef stock 750ml

saffron threads 1g

tomato 1, or 2 cherry tomatoes, halved

garlic 1 head, skin on, halved

pork ribs 300g, or smoked pancetta, cut into small pieces

potato 1 small, cut into 1-2cm cubes

morcilla 2 whole, preferably made with onion

chipolata sausages 4, or cooking chorizo, cut into small pieces

sweet smoked paprika 1 tsp

bay leaf 1

tomato 1, grated

paella rice 350g

tinned chickpeas 150g, drained

salt

olive oil

Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Bring the stock to the boil in a saucepan. Add the saffron and let simmer while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.

Place a casserole dish, roasting tray or ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat and heat some oil. Fry the tomato and garlic halves until golden and set aside.

Add the ribs, potato cubes and all the sausages to the dish and cook for 15 minutes, until golden and roasted. Add the sweet paprika, bay leaf, the grated tomato and salt to season, and fry carefully while stirring for 3-4 minutes. Add the rice and give all the ingredients a good stir. Cook over a medium heat for a further 2 minutes.

Pour the boiling stock into the dish along with the chickpeas and mix well, spreading the rice and meat around the whole dish. Place the garlic head and tomatoes on the top. Cook over the highest heat for 10 minutes and then transfer to the oven for a further 10 minutes.

Once the rice is cooked, leave it to rest for 3-4 minutes before serving in the centre of the table.

Elisabeth Luard’s ajo blanco – chilled almond soup

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ajo blanco – chilled almond soup. Photograph: Martin Poole for the Observer

A deliciously refreshing cold soup of the gazpacho family, as prepared in the rich vega, the fertile plain of Granada. The inclusion of almonds is a refinement introduced by the Moors. The legacy of six centuries of Muslim occupation did not vanish overnight – nor indeed did the extensive plantations of almond trees brought from the Jordan valley. Almonds are still an important cash crop for the small farmers of Andalusia, and the country people still take care to plant an almond tree at the edge of the olive groves for the pleasure of gathering the sweet nuts each autumn to be stored as a Christmas treat.

Serves 6 (you only need a little)

dry bread 3-4 slices

blanched almonds 3 tbsp

garlic 4-5 fresh young cloves

olive oil 2 tbsp

cold water 1 litre

salt

white wine vinegar 2 tbsp

small grapes a handful

Put the bread, almonds, garlic, oil and a pint of the water into the blender, and blend thoroughly. In the peasant kitchen, this job would have been done with a pestle and mortar, and there are those who say the soup is finest thus made. Add the rest of the water until you have the consistency you like. Season with salt and vinegar. Leave to cool, and put to infuse in the refrigerator for an hour or so. Or put all the ingredients except the grapes in the blender and blend them.

Peel and pip the grapes and float them on top of each serving of soup.

The patios of rural dwellings in the south are usually shaded by a trellis with a vine which bears grapes long into the winter months, so this ingredient is very much to hand, and is essential to the proper flavouring of the soup. Little cubes of bread, fried golden in olive oil and served sizzling hot, make an excellent addition.

Sicilians love fritto misto, so much so that in the summer people set up stalls or park vans or three-wheelers with gas burners and big pots on the back, and deep-fry vegetables or fish for you there and then.

Serves 4

baby artichokes 4

lemon juice of 1

salt 1 tbsp

cauliflower 1 small, cut into florets

cardoons 500g, tender heart only

apple 1, peeled and cored

vegetable oil for deep-frying

fresh anchovies or small sardines 500g, cleaned

For the pastella

plain flour 250g

water 150ml

egg 1 large, beaten

fresh yeast 10g

Peel the tough outer leaves from the artichokes, stopping when you reach the tender leaves, then cut in quarters vertically. With large artichokes, you need to cut out the hairy choke, but with baby ones, the choke will not have developed properly, so there is not much to remove. Put them into a bowl of water with a little lemon juice squeezed into it, to keep them from discolouring, until you are ready to use them. Drain, and dry.

Bring a pan of water to the boil and add the salt. Put in the cauliflower and cook for a couple of minutes, until just tender, then lift out and drain. Put the cardoons into the same water and cook for about 7-8 minutes, until they too are just tender, but still retain some bite. Drain and keep to one side.

Combine the flour, water, egg and yeast to make a pastella (batter) with a fluid consistency. Slice the apple, and cut the cardoons into strips. Heat several inches of oil in a high-sided pan (make sure it comes no higher than a third of the way up the pan) to 180C. If you don’t have a thermometer, put in a few breadcrumbs, and if they sizzle the oil is ready.

Immerse the artichokes in the pastella and deep-fry until golden. Lift out and drain on kitchen paper. Repeat with the cardoons, cauliflower and apple, then the anchovies or sardine fillets, and arrange everything together on a warm serving plate.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Squid stuffed with judión beans and tomatoes. Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin

For 4

squid, judión or butter beans, tomatoes, garlic, rosemary, dry sherry

Peel and finely slice 4 garlic cloves, then fry in a thin layer of olive oil in a deep frying pan till very lightly coloured. Cut 8 tomatoes into roughly 8 pieces each, then add to the garlic, together with the chopped leaves from a bushy sprig of rosemary. Cook for 6 or 7 minutes, till the mixture is soft, fragrant and quite juicy. Season with salt and pepper.

Drain 650g judión beans or butter beans of any bottling or canning liquor, rinsing them in a colander if you wish, then stir them gently into the tomato mixture and continue cooking, over a moderate heat, for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6.

Check 4 prepared medium squid, making sure that they are thoroughly clean and the transparent quills have been removed from the body sacs and discarded. Set aside the tentacles. Using a tablespoon, stuff the squid bodies with as much of the filling as you can, laying them down slightly apart in a roasting tin or large baking dish. Spoon any excess filling into the roasting tin.

Pour 300ml dry sherry around the squid, add a couple more rosemary sprigs to the tin and bake for 20-25 minutes, occasionally basting the squid with the sherry. Halfway through cooking, tuck the reserved tentacles around the squid bodies.

Serve the squid and tentacles in shallow bowls or on deep plates, spooning the thin juices around them as you go.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Borma – sweet walnut coil. Photograph: Martin Poole for the Observer

This is my Syrian aunt’s recipe for homemade baklava, which she formed into one big coil – hence the name borma, meaning “rolled” or “turned” in Arabic. She used to make her own dough, but to save time I substitute with a good-quality filo pastry, usually a Greek or Turkish brand.

Serves 6

golden caster sugar 275g

lemon juice 1 tsp

rose water 1½ tbsp

orange blossom water 1½ tbsp

shelled walnuts 200g, finely ground

ground cinnamon ¾ tsp

unsalted butter 75g, melted, plus extra for greasing

Greek or Turkish filo pastry 6 sheets measuring 31 x 46cm

You’ll need a baking dish measuring 25cm in diameter.

Put 175g of the sugar in a saucepan, add 75ml of water and place the pan over a medium heat. Bring to the boil and let the syrup bubble for 3 minutes, then add the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon each of the rose and orange blossom water. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside to cool.

Mix the ground walnuts with the remaining sugar, rose and orange blossom water and the cinnamon.

Preheat the oven to 220C/gas mark 7, and brush the baking dish with a little melted butter. If using a non-stick dish or pan, you won’t need to grease it.

Spread one sheet of filo on your work surface with the long side facing you – keep the other sheets covered so that they don’t dry up and become brittle. Brush with some of the melted butter. Arrange one-sixth of the walnut filling in a thin line lengthways across the sheet, about 1cm (1in) from the edge nearest to you. Fold the pastry over the walnuts and roll tightly into a thin sausage. Coil up the roll and place in the centre of the baking dish or tin. Make the remaining walnut rolls and coil them around the initial coil until the dish is completely covered.

Brush the top with melted butter and bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oven, pour the sugar syrup all over the borma and allow to cool. Serve at room temperature.

Claudia Roden’s djaj bil assal – chicken with caramelised baby onions and honey

This is one of the classics of Moroccan cooking and this version, with shallots or baby onions, is sensational. The art is to reduce the sauce at the end until it is rich and caramelised. It is important to taste in order to get the right balance between sweet and savoury.

Serves 4

shallots or baby onions 500g

onion 1, chopped

sunflower oil 4 tbsp

saffron threads a good pinch

ground ginger 1 tsp

ground cinnamon 1 tsp

chicken 1, jointed

salt and black pepper

clear honey 1-1½ tbsp

blanched almonds 100g, or a handful of sesame seeds, to garnish (optional)

To peel the shallots or baby onions, blanch them in boiling water for 5 minutes and when cool enough to handle, peel off the skins and trim the root ends.

Soften the chopped onion in the oil over a medium heat in a heavy-bottomed pan or casserole dish large enough to hold the chicken pieces in one layer. Stir in the saffron, ginger and cinnamon, then put in the chicken. Season with salt and pepper, and turn to brown lightly all over.

Add about 250ml water and cook, covered, over a low heat, turning the pieces over, for 15 minutes or until the chicken breasts are done. Lift out the breasts and put them on one side. Add the shallots or baby onions and continue to cook, covered, for about 25 minutes, or until the remaining chicken pieces are tender. During the cooking, turn the chicken pieces and stir the onions occasionally; add a little water if necessary.

Lift out the chicken pieces, and set to one side. Stir the honey into the pan. Check the seasoning. You need quite a bit of pepper to mitigate the sweetness. Cook, uncovered, until all the water has evaporated, and the onions are brown and caramelised, and so soft that you could crush them, as they say in Morocco, “with your tongue”.

Return the chicken pieces to the pan, spoon the onions on top of them and heat through. A few minutes should be enough. Serve, if you wish, sprinkled either with blanched almonds fried in a drop of oil until they are lightly golden, or with toasted sesame seeds.

Nigel Slater’s sea bass with lemon potatoes

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sea bass with lemon potatoes. Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin

Baking a joint of meat or a large fish on top of a layer of potatoes is a reliable way of ensuring they stay moist. The juices from the roast are soaked up by the potatoes, making sure that not a drop of flavour is wasted. Large fish such as sea bass and sea bream can be cooked in this way, as can Cornish mullet. Line-caught, ocean-friendly sea bass is not too difficult to find. I reckon on a 1kg fish being enough for two.

Enough for 2

For the fish

sea bass a whole fish, cleaned but left on the bone

olive oil

oregano a little, dried or fresh

For the potatoes

waxy-fleshed potatoes 500g, such as Anya or Pink Fir Apple

olive oil

lemon 1 large

anchovy fillets 12

vegetable stock 250ml

Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Slice each potato three or four times. If you do this lengthways you will end up with long, elegant pieces. Warm a couple of tablespoons of olive oil in a roasting tin over a moderately hot flame, then put the potatoes in and let them colour on both sides. They cook best if you leave them alone for several minutes in between stirring. You want them to be pale gold on both sides. Cut the lemon in half, then into thick segments. Add to the potatoes with the anchovy, and a grinding of black pepper and then pour over the stock.

Lay the fish on top of the potatoes, brush with a little olive oil, then add the herbs and a mild seasoning of salt and black pepper. Bake in the preheated oven until the flesh will slide easily away from the bone in big juicy pieces. This will take a matter of 25-30 minutes. Serve the fish with the potatoes and spoon over the stock.

Pierre Koffmann’s lamb couscous

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Lamb couscous. Photograph: David Loftus

In France, couscous is the national dish! The French absolutely love it. When I was in the army doing my national service in Toulon, the way to please our superiors was to make a couscous.

A good couscous is a beautiful thing, yet like so many dishes that have migrated, it can be done badly. A proper couscous is a labour of love. It begins with the grains themselves – traditionally, women roll the mixture of coarse semolina (farina), semolina flour and water in their hands to make the tiny granules. To watch them, as I’ve been lucky enough to do, is to be treated to an incredible sight; their skill is mesmerizing. Then comes the making of the dish itself, which in North African homes is an expression of love, generosity and hospitality. A lady I know butterflies her lamb and roasts it very, very slowly. The aroma of the spices – cinnamon and saffron, turmeric and cumin – riding in the steam of the simmering lamb and slowly filling her kitchen is intoxicating.

Serves 4

lamb rump steaks 4 x 150g

vegetable oil 2 tbsp

carrots 120g, chopped

courgettes 120g, chopped

turnips 120g, chopped

chickpeas 1 x 400g can, drained

merguez sausages 4

harissa paste 2 tbsp

salt and pepper

For the lamb stock

olive oil 100ml

lamb bones 2kg

carrots 2, roughly chopped

onions 3, roughly chopped

garlic 5 cloves

bouquet garni 1 (see below)

tomato puree 2 tbsp

cinnamon stick 1 small

ground ginger 1 tbsp

ground coriander 1 tbsp

paprika 1 tbsp

saffron threads a pinch

For the couscous

couscous 300g medium

cumin 1 tbsp

sultanas 80g

olive oil 3 tbsp

ground turmeric 1½ tsp

saffron threads a pinch

For the bouquet garni

celery 1 stick

flat-leaf parsley 4 stalks

bay leaf 1

thyme 2 sprigs

green leek leaves 3

For the bouquet garni, wrap the celery, parsley, bay leaf and thyme in the leek leaves, and tie in three places with string.

Start by making the lamb stock. Heat a large pan, wide and deep enough to hold the bones. Add the olive oil, then the bones and leave them to brown over a medium heat. Add the remaining ingredients, then pour in enough cold water just to cover. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and leave to simmer for 2 hours. At this point, taste and check the flavour, then pass the stock through a sieve and set aside.

Heat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4.

Season the lamb all over. Heat an ovenproof frying pan and when hot, add the oil, then the lamb steaks and seal the meat. Transfer to the oven and roast for 15 minutes. Remove and leave to rest for 10 minutes.

While the lamb is cooking, cook each chopped vegetable separately in boiling salted water, until al dente. Drain well and transfer to a small saucepan. Mix with the chickpeas and keep warm over a low heat.

Heat a frying pan over a medium heat and fry the merguez until cooked through.

For the couscous, place the couscous and the other couscous ingredients in a large bowl. Pour in just enough boiling water to cover (about 400ml), mix well and leave to stand for a few minutes until the couscous has absorbed all the water.

While the lamb is resting, measure 250ml of the lamb stock. Place in a small pan, stir in the harissa paste and warm through. To serve, transfer the couscous to a warm serving bowl. Slice the merguez and mix with the vegetables. Place the lamb on the couscous, arrange the vegetables alongside and serve immediately with the harissa sauce.

salt and pepper

To desalt the cod, soak it in plain water, in the fridge, for about 48 hours. Change the water three or four times each day.

Once desalted, place the salt cod and bay leaf in cold water to cover; then bring to just below the boiling point on medium heat. Cover and let the pot stand off the heat for about 10 minutes.

Remove the salt cod from the water and cool, setting the water aside.

When the fish has cooled, remove the skin or bones, if any, and flake the flesh with a fork.

Cook the potatoes until soft in the reserved salt-cod water, then drain, discarding the water.

In another pan, bring 300ml water and 2 tablespoons oil to a boil, then remove from the heat and slowly beat in the flour to form a batter. Beat in the eggs one at a time.

Mash the salt cod, potato slices, garlic and parsley together well in a large bowl, add salt and pepper to taste; then mix the batter into the salt cod mixture.

Cook on a low flame until the mixture thickens slightly and will hold its shape when formed into balls.

Fill a cassola or other deep pan with at least 2½cm of oil (or use a deep-frier) and heat the oil to 190C.

Form salt-cod balls in the bowl of a deep spoon, then fry in batches until deep golden-brown.

Drain on paper towels before serving, but serve very hot.

In Spain, they wrap the peaches in tissue paper when they are hanging in the tree so I love the idea of “hanging poached peaches”. You can make the peaches and keep them preserved in bottles. My mum used to do this so we could eat peaches throughout the year. For the ice cream, use the best fruity Arbequina olive oil that you can find – it is perfectly mild and fruity.

Serves 4

peaches 4 large, ripe

vanilla pod 1

sweet white wine 500ml, such as Moscatel de Chipiona

clear honey 2 tbsp

For the ice cream

whole milk 200ml

egg yolks 5 large

caster sugar 100g

double cream 300ml

lemon finely grated zest of 1

fruity Arbequina olive oil 150ml

For the ice cream, bring the milk to the boil in a medium pan. Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks with the sugar until pale and thick. Gradually whisk in the hot milk, strain the mixture back into the pan and cook over a gentle heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture coats the back of a wooden spoon. Remove from the heat, leave to cool, then stir in the cream, lemon zest and olive oil and refrigerate overnight.

The next day, churn the ice cream mixture either in an ice-cream machine, or pour it into a shallow container and freeze until almost solid. Scrape into the bowl of a food processor and blend briefly until smooth, then return to the container and freeze once more. Repeat this 2-3 times more until the mixture is very smooth. Return to the freezer for 6 hours until firm or until needed.

Put the peaches into a heatproof bowl. Fill another bowl with iced water. Cover the peaches with boiling water and leave for 30 seconds, then remove and drop into the iced water. The skins should now peel away easily.

Slice the vanilla pod in half lengthways and scrape out the seeds with a tip of a knife. Put the pod and seeds into a pan (choose one in which the peaches will fit snugly in a single layer) with the sweet wine and honey and heat gently until the honey has dissolved. Add the peaches, bring to a simmer, cover and cook very gently for 15 minutes, carefully turning them over now and then with a wooden spoon, until they are just tender and can be pierced easily through to the stone with a cocktail stick.

When the peaches are cooked, gently transfer them and the vanilla pod to a bowl. Return the syrup to the heat and boil rapidly until reduced to 200ml. Leave to cool, then pour back over the peaches and chill until needed. Serve with the olive oil and lemon ice cream.

The motivational phrases beloved of sportspeople might seem trite, but for players from Katie Boulter and Andy Murray to Arthur Ashe, they’re surprisingly important

Katie Boulter can console herself that, while she could not beat a player 178 places further up the rankings, her Wimbledon dream did not end because she lacked motivation. There it was, in bold words, underlined for good measure, on a folded piece of paper.

“YOU DESERVE THIS – Focus,” the 20-year-old read quietly during breaks in her grand slam debut on Tuesday. “Trust yourself and trust your game ... Play the match like it’s the last match of your life – show how much you want it.”

It would be easy to scoff at such basic exhortations and imagine that Boulter, from Leicestershire, lives her best life among cushions, mugs and Facebook posts bearing similar slogans. But is she also deploying basic science in her bid for victory?

Certainly she is not alone in bringing #inspiration to her game. Andy Murray may or may not still carry with him a sheet of similar notes. Captured by a photographer during the Rotterdam Open in 2015, they ranged from the obvious (“Try your best”; “Focus on each point”; “Be good to yourself”) to the curiously worded (“Be intense with your legs”).

“These are simple refocusing strategies,” says Professor Ian Maynard, a sports psychologist at Sheffield Hallam University. “Most athletes constantly worry about winning or losing, but all they can control is performance. These triggers are designed to bring them back into themselves rather than worrying about the enormity of the situation.”

Maynard has worked with Britain’s wave-ruling sailors, and says they made posters of Ben Ainslie and co with slogans such as Nike’s “Just Do It” and “KISS” (Keep it simple, stupid). “Shirley Robertson had what we call ‘race words’ written on the side of her boat in indelible ink,” he says of the double gold medallist turned broadcaster.

Michael Caulfield, a sports psychologist and director of Sporting Edge, a performance consultancy, cites a much older example. “When people ask me, when did sports psychology get invented, I tell them to go back to Arthur Ashe,” he says. “They all used it back then, just without the jargon.”

In the 1975 men’s Wimbledon final, which Ashe won, he read an envelope he kept in his racket cover (contents unknown). His opponent, Jimmy Connors, tucked notes from his late grandmother into his right sock. “The idea is to bring you back to a simple place,” Caulfield adds. “[Boulter] might be thinking: ‘If I win, I make £50,000 and get to the second round and if I do that I get on the tour and get a contract and a sponsor ...’ your mind goes at 100mph. This just stops all of that.”

Jens Voigt, the retired German cyclist famed for his endurance, trademarked his inspirational slogan. “Shut up legs” has appeared on countless handlebars since. If Murray progresses to the latter rounds of Wimbledon, he may wish to add “shut up, hip” to his courtside paperwork.

Katie Boulter may have been a Wimbledon debutant but didn't play like it as she almost shocked Christina McHale in their round one clash on Tuesday.

The British 20-year-old, regarded a star of the future, proved a tough customer for the American ranked 178 places above her by the WTA.

Boulter played with confidence and poise beyond her major tournament experience, only to squander a commanding position in the third set.

And perhaps a sneak peak into her inner sanctum at the change of ends could go some way to explaining her impressive showing.

Boulter read pre-prepared typed notes telling her that this was her time and place to shine.

"You have the right to be here, you deserve this," read the headline.

"Focus and fight," they continued.

"Enjoy the challenge" and "play like it's the last match of your life."

"Show how much you want it."

Boulter certainly made a statement that this isn't the last we've seen of her at SW19.

She was leading by a set and then by a break in the decider, only for McHale to fight back and win 3-6 7-5 6-3.

Granted a wild card to make her first singles appearance in the main draw at the All England Club, Boulter will have been disappointed not to capitalise on what was a stirring opening performance.

In her first Wimbledon press conference, she said: "For me, personally, I think it's the best place to play in the world, and I look forward to any opportunities that I have here.

"But I'm completely devastated at this one moment. I'm sure in the next couple of days I will reflect on it a little bit more."

"Of course I'm proud to represent my country and to give my all. That's where I'm at right now.

"But I really felt like I could win the match, and I was in with a chance. From the very first ball I felt comfortable out there. I'm very happy with the way I played.

"I think it's amazing, actually. I look at it now, and I have been through so much.

"I think it was better than I ever expected. I mean, you cannot describe the feelings that go through you when you play that match.

"Especially when you really feel like you have a chance to win it and progress and get better when you're out there.

"It was much better than I even ever thought or dreamt of."

Boulter also shed some light on her use of notes.

"It's something myself and my coach and my team have talked about and it's something that helps me remind myself of what I have to do when I go out. I think it helped me a lot today," she said.

Before the tournament Boulter said she had been inspired by Leicester City's underdog Premier League victory the season before last.

The 20-year-old was appearing in her first-ever senior Grand Slam and eager to emulate the feats of favourite player Jamie Vardy and co.

Unfortunately for the world No.235, despite being given more of a chance at glory than the Foxes in the miracle season - a 2,000-1 title shot compared to their 5,000-1 win - her campaign is over.

McHale came into the match horribly out of form, with just three wins in her last 11 tournaments.

She now faces the tough ask of taking on No.9 seed Agnieszka Rawanska.

Behind the medieval city of Tallinn, a former Hanseatic port and a Unesco world heritage site, the woods run to the Russian border. The Estonians have sought their shelter in times of trouble: forest covers 90% of this tiny EU country on the Baltic, and with Russia next door, trouble has never been hard to find. “The forest is a fur coat,” says an Estonian proverb. But now it offers more than warmth and shelter: a young generation of Estonian chefs are using it to feed a cooking revolution, too.

Whether it’s spruce shoots or pickled ramsons, blackcurrant leaves or grated green pine cones, Estonian chefs are returning to the forest – and to the miles of Baltic sea that ring the stony beaches of the coast and islands – using the startlingly brief warm summers to track down folk flavours that they combine and adapt in unexpected ways. This is the “new Nordic” cuisine as pioneered at Noma in Copenhagen by René Redzepi, with an Estonian twist: fresh, local, making the most of its seasons. And unlike Noma, it doesn’t have to cost the earth. Estonian chefs don’t have a big middle-class clientele to cater for, so it remains good value.

For chefs who were not born when their country regained independence in 1991, the revolution is all about food. They have travelled to Finland, Sweden and Denmark, worked in kitchens across northern Europe, and imbibed the Nordic style first hand. The idea is to get away from the peppers/garlic/tomato triumvirate behind Mediterranean-inspired cookery, and instead use their skills to put a spin on traditional ingredients and techniques. In a country that spends eight months of the year in wintry darkness, that means a lot of fish and game, and plenty of food preservation: smoking, pickling, salting and drying.

Perhaps surprisingly, Estonia was one of Britain’s traditional sources of bacon before the second world war, and the black flitches laid out in the market at Tallinn’s Baltic Station suggest that nothing has been forgotten; it’s well worth getting out of bed for thinly sliced Estonian streaky bacon on toast. Meanwhile, those long dark nights drive Estonia’s chefs to pounce on startling colours, like orange sea buckthorn berries, or rapeseed oil infused with chives.

For the two chefs at Leib (see below), which opened in 2011, it has meant working directly with farmers and promising to buy their entire output of young vegetables, which have to be cured or preserved the moment they arrive. Orm Oja, the young head chef at Noa, remembers getting baby carrots for free from old ladies in the market who couldn’t understand why he wasn’t buying their giant roots. But the old ladies have their secrets, too, and these young chefs know it’s worth listening to grandma when she explains about the herbs, grasses, folk remedies and the forest fruits that sustained Estonians through the tribulations of the 20th century.

The movement is still small, and in a country of 1.3 million people, finding chefs is an ongoing challenge. But then, so too is finding diners prepared to pay European prices, so eating out in Tallinn is relatively cheap. Some chefs have opened a sister restaurant for high-rollers, but the destinations below operate as everyday restaurants, with high presentation and cookery skills. Just as Estonians have aligned themselves with the sleek design and minimalist aesthetic of their Scandinavian neighbours, so they’re bringing a new energy and enthusiasm to Tallinn’s tables.

Leib Restoran

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Erik Riikoja

Leib means “black bread” in Estonian – “fresh, warm, simple and honest”, just what chef Janno Lepik and sommelier Kristjan Peäske wanted when they opened Leib in a courtyard beneath the medieval walls. It still belongs to Tallinn’s members-only Scottish Club, with a cabinet of single malts and a statue of Sean Connery in the garden, but visitors will find a weekly-changing menu of fresh wild and organic dishes, and drinks that include the house-fermented kombucha, and rowanberry schnapps. There is a lot of pike perch and other fish, and a dessert of frozen yoghurt and cherry cream is enlivened with shavings of Jerusalem artichoke and grated egg yolk.

• Mains from €13.50, Uus 31, +372 611 9026, leibresto.ee

Noa

There’s a 12-course tasting menu for €89, but more affordable main courses too. Here, 23-year old chef Orm Oja has been experimenting with some hardcore traditions, like exploiting the natural fermentation of overwintered vegetables. He’s interested in using ants, too, to create a starter for sourdough bread, the way peasants did when freezing winter weather killed off their starter. It also has a fire pit where Noa’s chefs recreate the tarry, pungent heat of a traditional Estonian sauna. Expect salt fish, piglet with smoked apple, and scallops served with spruce shoots and lime.

In the larder, 34-year-old chef Ranno Paukson points out slippery green bags of pickled ramsons – wild garlic leaves harvested from the woods – alongside stacks of wild brain mushrooms in boxes, waiting to be preserved; shelves of alluring jars twinkle in the restaurant. It’s all woods and water for the two young chefs (the other being Martin Meikas) who grew up on the little Baltic island of Muhu, off Estonia’s west coast, and brought their formidable talents to Tallinn three years ago. Salted elk is paired with Icelandic moss, pike with marinated cauliflower. There are big flavours and fabulous presentation, and behind the scenes, the chefs are experimenting with curing lamb and creating their own black garlic.

Mon Repos

The menu at chef Vladislav Djatšuk’s award-winning renovation of a 100-year-old restaurant is not so much “new Nordic” as an exploration of regional tradition and history. Djatšuk has worked in Finland, Denmark and France, where he reached the finals of the Bocuse d’Or, and also worked his way through Tallinn’s town archives to dig out czarist-era recipes that he uses to concoct ultra-modern dishes that speak to the grandeurs of the past, such as pigeon in madeira or lavaret (a variety of salmon trout), served with shrimp mash and a crayfish bisque. The building is in a park overlooked by Tallinn’s Kadriorg Palace, built by Peter the Great for his Czarina.

Only in Estonia – where means can be limited and chefs may want to avoid the costs and risks of setting up a fine-dining restaurant – would the winner of the Best Chef in Estonia Award, 26-year-old Mihkel Rand, choose to work 18-hour days at the counter of his new Chinese-inspired bun shack. In the newly-renovated Baltic Station market, where bacon, elk and smoked fish the colour of an old pub ceiling is for sale in the food halls, BaoJaam brings delicious squishy baoz buns together with barbecued meat, chicken and fish for a cheap and wildly popular street food hit.

Tallinn, one of Europe’s newest capitals, boasts a rich mix of architecture and culture in a small geographic area. Its Old Town was almost untouched by war and remains perfectly preserved. And outside the city walls there are beguiling districts of brightly painted wooden houses, parks, redeveloped docks, beaches and forests.

There are still stag dos and plenty of bars where Finns fresh off the Helsinki ferry chug bargain beers, but Tallinn is also a cultured place that attracts visitors who wants more than just a cheap drink: Baltic, Nordic, Teutonic and Russian cultures meld in food, art, design and music. The annual Tallinn Music Week (27 March-2 April) showcases Estonia’s growing rock and electronic music scene in venues including the city’s old power station (kultuurikatel.ee).

The city has a surprisingly modern, sophisticated air: trams and buses (free for the locals) make everything easily accessible and old warehouses are being converted into new spaces for business and culture. Free wifi and a nascent tech scene (Skype was developed here) show this is a city looking forward as well as to its traditional, folkloric roots.

Song Festival Grounds

Every five years (the next one is in July 2019) Tallinn has its Last Night of the Proms moment as 30,000-odd singers from 1,000 choirs belt out traditional anthems to the white, blue and black flag-waving masses who gather for the Song Festival, which began in 1869 and has developed into one of Estonia’s key cultural get-togethers. The sprawling grassy bowl is the perfect place for a Sunday stroll, while the huge shell-like structure on which the singers stand is a modernist treat designed in 1959 by Alar Kotli. A previous stage stood on the site from the 1920s but the one that soars over the park today was built to accommodate the vast numbers of singers and spectators who flock to the event – and its popularity, which mirrors feelings of “Estonian-ism” in the country continues to rise. The stories in the songs and the use of the Estonian language to sing them reach deep into the heart of the Estonian soul and collective culture.

Estonian Architecture Museum

This is the perfect place to start exploring the Rotermann Quarter – a former industrial district that’s being turned into shops, offices and flats. This chunky old salt warehouse at the heart of the neighbourhood houses the museum and is chocka with models of the most interesting buildings in town, such as 23 Roosikrantsi Street by Robert Natuse – an expressionist gem built of dark bricks and with a pointed prow that recalls the Chilehaus in Hamburg, plus a model of a huge planned seaside sanatorium in Estonia’s coastal city, Parnu, which was never built. There are fascinating hand-drawn plans (mostly from the Soviet era) for overblown reconstructions of Tallinn city centre, crowned with towerblocks and megastructures. Again the plans never came to fruition because of the sums involved, and a sense that the history of the city was worth preserving. However, there are some big bits of bluster from the communist age around Tallinn – like the Viru Hotel’s skyscraper slab and the Linnahall, an evocative, crumbling wreck destined to be transformed into a concert venue and conference centre.

Von Krahl

A handsome traditional stone pub and theatre in Tallinn’s Old Town, where buildings jostle against the hillside, Von Krahl is all steep steps and characterful wooden beams on a street (Rataskaevu) that dates back to the 1700s. The team behind it took over the place in 1992 as Communism ended and free expression widened in Tallinn. Today, all kinds of left-field plays are put on here and one of the most recent was titled Hipsteri Surm, which translates as “Hipster Death”. Bands stop off too. Hundreds jammed in during Tallinn Music Week (see above) last year to see Estonian neo-folk trio Trad.Attack!, who sample one of their member’s late granny’s vocals on upbeat, dancey tracks.

Umami



With its mid-century furniture and local artists’ paintings on the wall, Umami is cool – yet far removed from the showiness those places often suffer from. This is the second restaurant from Janno Lepik and Kristjan Peäske; the first is Leib, in the old town. Warm staff, an open kitchen and a family-friendly vibe go alongside food such as local cod and salads with rocket and beetroot. Umami is inside an old house on the edge of a park in the Mustamae district, which – along with the laid-back atmosphere – makes it feel more like you’re going to someone’s for dinner than out to a restaurant.

Lennusadam Seaplane Harbour

Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Lembit submarine in the main hall of the Seaplane Harbour Museum. Photograph: Alamy

If visiting a seaplane hangar sounds boring, stick with us – this 100-year-old concrete behemoth is cavernous, and miraculously has no supports inside. It was put up to house seaplanes for the Tsar’s navy in 1916 and has survived a century’s tumult in Tallinn. In its new iteration as a museum (opened in 2012 after the threatened hangar was saved and restored), the planes are back. They date from the first world war, and there are boats and submarines from the 1930s to the 1990s. The punchy lighting, huge fans and dramatic walkways inside make it look more like a nightclub, which it sometimes is.

TV Tower

One of the best things about a trip to the Teletorn (TV Tower) is the bus ride out through the bottle green pine forests that fringe Tallinn. The tower is a classic of Soviet design – raw concrete reaching for the sky and screaming about how technologically advanced the socialist society was in the 1970s (despite some indicators to the contrary). At the top you can be buffeted by the breeze on an outdoor platform – and even peer over the Baltic to Finland on a clear day.

• teletorn.ee

Levier Cakery

The fascinating district of Kalamaja is worth a walk. Just get off the tram at the Balti Jaam stop and head north, away from the Old Town, where you’ll find streets that look as if they’ve been airlifted in from Reykjavik – homes made from corrugated iron and wooden slats painted yellow, cream and blue. In the midst of the area several cafes keep locals happy, such as Levier. The outdoor tables are the ones to grab, and there’s a big nod towards France: macarons and elegant patisserie are stacked up by the counter.

• levier.ee

Pirita

For an easy day out, take the 34 bus from Viru Square to the pleasant coastal suburb of Pirita, to the east of Tallinn. There are sweeping views of the city’s harbour and skyline from its pretty promenade and long, sandy beach. Men fish in the Pirita river where it enters the Baltic, and this is the site of the Olympic Village, accommodation for sailing teams during the Moscow 1980 Olympics (the complex is now a spa hotel). The Russian influence is obvious on the waterfront Maarjamäe war memorial, designed by Allan Murdmaa and Matti Varik in 1975, with its concrete sculptures commemorating fallen Red Army soldiers.

No 99



This attractive old theatre has a wonderful art deco cafe with dark colours and a classy vibe reflecting Estonia’s golden age in the 1920s and 30s, when it was an independent nation expressing itself artistically with the new styles of the age. It’s a perfect embodiment of the elegance and restraint of the city and was the venue Estonia’s music-mad former president Toomas Hendrik Ilves chose to DJ at during last year’s Tallinn Music Week. He played tracks from his charity mix album Teenage Wasteland by MC5, The Who, New York Dolls and David Bowie.

Telliskivi Loomelinnak or just “Telliskivi” as locals say (the other bit means “creative city”) is a fascinating collection of old railway buildings (though those same locals posit that there was actually secret military manufacture going on here, too) near Tallinn’s main station. Today’s it’s home to creatives’ studios, nightclubs, a cycle shop that doubles as a bar (jooks.cc). One of the first businesses to move here was little restaurant F Hoone, which has a relaxed vibe, bare brick walls, traditonal Estonian grub, and a helpful map of Tallinn printed across the floor.

Copenhagen



At a glance The revolution launched by the restaurant Noma over a decade ago forged a distinctly Nordic cuisine and, in the process, turned Copenhagen into a foodie destination. Now that revolution is entering a second phase. No longer confined to the kind of high-end places that do innovative things with sea urchins and foraged sorrel, these days and the list of the city’s most exciting restaurants and bars includes spots that aren’t expensive, or even all that Nordic. What they share are the big flavours and attention to quality that many of their owners learned at Noma.



Eat Christian Puglisi broke with the Nordic doctrine when, as one of the first of Noma’s chefs to venture out on his own, he opened Relæ six years ago. Last summer, he decided to explore his Sicilian roots with Bæst, a pizzeria where the charcuterie is from organic pigs, the mozzarella is made by hand from Danish milk, and the pies are baked in a wood-burning oven in the centre of the restaurant (pizzas from £12). Hija de Sánchez brings the same attention to detail to tacos (three tacos for £10). Founded by Noma’s former pastry chef, Rosio Sanchez, it’s a market taqueria that grinds its own corn and makes its own tortillas. And Tuesdays to Saturdays in summer, former Noma head chef Matt Orlando complements his seasonal menu at Amass with takeout fried chicken and coleslaw (£19). On a warm night, a box of crisp chicken and a glass of wine in its waterfront garden may be the city’s best picnic.

Drink Copenhagen has one of the world’s highest concentrations of natural wine bars – another legacy, at least in part, of Noma. One worthy recent arrival is Gaarden og Gaden, a lively spot with a list heavy on French and Austrian bottles (£7 a glass), and a mean croque monsieur. For something a little stronger, Balderdash serves delicious, inventive cocktails (a recent concoction included an extract of beaver gland) in a cosily renovated building that dates from the 18th century (£10 a cocktail).

Stay Urban House (dorm beds from £20, doubles from £100) opened last year in the trendy neighbourhood of Vesterbro, and is clearly aimed at a young crowd. Part hotel, part hostel, it is stylishly, if simply, designed, with a wide variety of onsite extras, including a bar and a tattoo shop.



If you see one thing Do it from a bike. Copenhagen is routinely ranked as the most bike-friendly city in the world and has around 450km of dedicated routes. A cycle hire programme, City Bike, launched in 2014 (look for the stands of big white bikes that operate with the swipe of a credit card, £2.75), but there’s also a rental shop on nearly every corner (about £10 a day).

Oslo



At a glance Europe’s fastest-growing capital (there’s been a 22% population hike in the past 10 years) has recently seen its downtown and industrial sectors undergo a massive transformation, with warehouse conversions and rebuilding projects, such as the area around the new Opera House or the vibrant, village-like Vulkan complex. This has given rise to bars, bistros and coffee joints run or inspired by young innovators: 2015 Bocuse d’Or winner Ørjan Johannessen from the restaurant Bekkjarvik Gjestgiveri, 2004 barista world champion Tim Wendelboe of the eponymous coffee bar, and 2000 winner Robert Thoresen of Mocca and Java. There are starred chefs – Even Ramsvik at Sentralen and Esben Holmboe Bang of Maaemo – and all this comes with the fresh air, mountains and a fjord packed with islands. Despite Norway’s reputation as an expensive place, local chefs take pride in making excellent food and drinks at reasonable prices.

Eat Oslo’s new food hall, the Mathallen, is part of the new Vulkan development, in a former industrial area on the Akerselva river, which divides Oslo. Mathallen consists of numerous stalls with shared spaces, where you can sit and enjoy food from around the world: south-east Asian streetfood at Atelier Asian Tapas; confit duck, foie gras, cheese and wine at Ma Poule; Italian ice-cream at Paradis Gelateria, or seafood and fish and chips at Vulkanfisk for around £10. The centre of the downtown revival is recently pedestrianised Torggata, where among a run of new Nordic eateries (Arakataka, Café Sør, Lokk, Peloton, Taco Republica, and Wünderburger) is the feted Jor (meals about £10), which serves simple, local food such as baked beetroot with blackcurrants.

Nearby Fredensborgveien has also been transformed, with vibrant cafes, bars and quirky shops (Chez Colin, Fredens café and Den Gode Café, for example). The cheap and cheerful Bon Lió gastrobar (dishes £11-£16) is a hot spot in a small 1814 house, using Norwegian ingredients to make Spanish-style tapas. A sample dish is tartar of tuna, tomatoes, dates and sesame seeds. But the great thing about Oslo is its majestic surroundings, so take a picnic, jump aboard a ferry and go island-hopping around the Oslo fjord to enjoy the views. Buy cooked shrimps from the fishermen at the City Hall pier and wine at the Vinmonopolet (the off-licence with a state monopoly on selling alcoholic drinks above 4.5% in Norway), which is two minutes’ walk away in the Aker Brygge area. Some islands, such as Nakholmen and Lindøya, do have grocery shops that open in summer. Ferries go from the City Hall and tickets cost £2.80, the same as for the tram.

Drink Cosy up with a cairpirinha and enjoy live bands at Café Brasil on Youngstorget, a plaza with numerous bars and eateries. The best place for dance music is Blå, a graffiti-adorned warehouse-style club (it used to store gold and diamonds) with big-name DJs and bands supplying the beats and an terrace to cool down on. Prices are pretty good for Oslo, with beer at £8 and burgers about £10. Finish off at Bar Boca (no website), at 36 Thorvald Meyers gate, a tiny 1950s-style cocktail bar that serves excellent drinks for about £15 and “the biggest Cuban-style tuna sandwich in Oslo”, for under £10. Or grab a cheaper beer and watch the world go by on the busy main street in Grünerløkka.

Stay City Box at 6 Prinsens gate (doubles from £50) has a self-service reception and neat but small rooms. It’s a few minutes’ walk to Oslo’s main shopping street, Karl Johans gate, which stretches from the station to the castle. But for more offbeat shops and coffee bars, head to the side streets.

If you see one thing Take a walk on the roof of Oslo Opera House (free), which has become the capital’s main attraction, thanks to its unusual, sloping architecture, designed by Snøhetta. From here, take in views of Oslo, the mountains and the fjord islands. There are usually rooftop events, from pop-up art shows to concerts, and world-class ballet and opera inside.

Reykjavik



At a glance Reykjavik is known for colourful houses, offbeat charm – and high prices. With gastropubs and boutique hotels opening on every corner,, to cater for the ever growing number of visitors, it may seem like the city is beyond the means of many. But, as the Icelandic national football team has just proved, nothing is impossible.

Eat Brauð & Co is a new artisan and organic bakery in downtown Reykjavik, selling sourdough bread baked to co-owner Ágúst Einþórsson’s own recipe, croissants and cinnamon buns (£3) that are worth every calorie. If the delicious smell doesn’t lead you in the right direction, the whole building is covered with a mural by local street artist Youze, making it hard to miss. In Skerjafjörður, the Bike Cave is a combined bike shop and burger joint, where you’ll find burgers at fair prices with plenty of vegetarian and vegan options (luxury burger with bearnaise sauce or lamb steak sandwich £7, veggie burgers £5). And if you’re all sweaty, coming straight from a bicycle tour, the Bike Cave even offers shower facilities for a small fee.

In one of Reykjavík’s historic downtown buildings, designed by the former state architect of Iceland, Guðjón Samúlesson, is Apótek Restaurant . Although the only thing you’ll get for a tenner is the soup of the day, its £18 lunch offer (sea trout and rack of lamb, for example) is fine dining for the budget-conscious.



Drink Petersen Svítan is a new rooftop bar in one of Reykjavik’s historic buildings: Gamla Bíó. Once a cinema and later the home of the Icelandic Opera, Gamla Bíó is now a popular music venue, and Petersen Svítan is the perfect place for a few cold ones and snacks before a show.It offers one of the best views in the city from the outdoor area, and happy hour runs from 11.30am to 8pm (beer £3.60, wine £4.50). Public House on Reykjavik’s main drag offers a reasonable selection of craft beers and yummy snacks – duck chopsticks (£8), scallop ceviche (£8.95). Albeit short (3pm-6pm), its happy hour is especially budget-friendly, with a pint starting at under £3. If cocktails are your poison, you can’t go wrong with Slippbarinn at the Reykjavík Marina Hotel by the up-and-coming Old Harbour. It has an awesome drinks selection and impressive happy-hour offerings – its most popular cocktails are a lime-leaf gimlet and the classic margarita (both £7.20).

Stay Although the Reykjavik Downtown Hostel (dorm rooms from £35, doubles £150) is not flashy, the location is central – in a residential street a stone’s throw from the harbour – and the staff friendly. If dorms don’t appeal, there are private rooms with en suites. For a nearby watering hole, try the flight of Icelandic craft beers at Microbar (five beers for £17).

If you see one thing Pay attention to the charming little details as you walk around the city. Picturesque, toy-town, corrugated houses, beautiful murals, fascinating sculptures and friendly cats give Reykjavik a special quality that makes you fall in love with it.

Copenhagen feels like one of the sleepiest capitals in Europe. A million people live here but everything's relaxed, nobody's in a rush and it's very safe. It's very easy to find a big space, and there's plenty of history.

One of the best parks for kids is just outside Copenhagen. It's called Dyrehaven (visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/the-deer-park), which means animal garden and that's what it is. There are deer and rabbits roaming free and you can walk among them. And there's tons of things to eat there, like wild mint or the tender leaves of birch trees. Kids truly love it. I don't know if anyone does organised foraging there though – I'm thinking of a business model …

Once you're at Dyrehaven, you may as well continue 20 minutes further north to a modern art gallery called Louisiana which is also really good for children. It's a nice way to give them that culture hit. And since you're there you may as well keep going another 20 minutes further north to see Kronborg castle in Helsingor (the setting for Hamlet).

The best view of the city is from Kastellet (kastellet.info), an old military ground. You can see across the harbour, the residential areas and all of historic Copenhagen. You can walk all the way round the top, and it's free. It's a great for a morning run, too.

Ved Stranden wine bar, Copenhagen

Copenhagen has one of the best food scenes in Europe, but also some of the best coffee. The first thing I would do in the city is grab an espresso and a croissant at Det Vide Hus (Gothersgade 113), right across from the King's Garden, which is a nice place to walk.

The first big contribution Denmark made to cooking has to be smørrebrød. Something's definitely gone wrong with the way we describe it, though, because it's just known as a sandwich. But the people who make it go to school for four years. It's not just a sandwich; it's a whole cuisine. There's one restaurant called Schønnemann in the city centre which has been open since the 19th century, and you really feel like you're stepping back into a different age. It's really old-fashioned. It's only open for lunch, and it's always booked. You go there to drink lots of schnapps, lots of beer, and big slabs of cured stuff with a bit of bread underneath them.

I'm not a big fan of the visuals of the new Opera House exterior. It's just another grey building in Copenhagen, where it's grey six months of the year. But, on the inside, I find it stunning – it's worth trying to see a show there. The same thing goes for the concert hall at the Danish Broadcasting Company (dr.dk/Koncerthuset): they've just rebuilt it and inside it's astonishing, with amazing sound.

This is the biggest Copenhagen secret I've ever given away: in the King's Garden, there are five 200-year-old mulberry trees and, in summer, they produce the best mulberries you will ever taste. You have to wear clothes that you can afford to throw out afterwards because they stain so much, but I can guarantee you that better ones than in that garden don't exist.

Vesterbro is the coolest area, as it feels most multicultural, but there's a lot going on in Christiania, too. The cultural thing the locals do is go to Christiania. I used to go there for the sauna and the smith shops: we used to have a lot of our ironwork done by a group of lesbian smiths. The bike shop is astonishing, too – hand-made bicycles by people from Christiania.

I don't eat out much. I'm more of a park guy, but the last restaurant I went to was Amass , across the harbour from Kastellet, which is outstanding. I ate one of the best vegetarian dishes I've ever had in my life there – biodynamically grown pumpkin, cooked slowly with freshly made hazelnut oil. It sounds like nothing but when you eat it, it's just extraordinarily good. The chef, Matt Orlando, used to be my sous chef, and if he continues the way he is going right now, he's going to be the next king of Europe.

Quite a few people who have worked with me have set up restaurants in the city. One of the affordable ones is a place called Bror which means brother, owned by Victor Wågman and Sam Nutter. It's quite new, always packed but very relaxed – you could almost come naked if you wanted to. And there's Manfreds , set up by Christian F Puglisi and Kim Rossen. You go there to eat vegetable dishes and have a glass of biodynamic wine – you almost feel healthy as you leave.

I don't know much about bars. I'm really not a cocktail guy – I find them far too sweet and sticky. But people like going to Ruby's or 1105.

There's a wine bar called Ved Stranden that's one of the most sophisticated, coolest wine bars in Scandinavia. I also love a beer bar called Mikkeler , in Vesterbro. The owner has 50 brews on tap, and they change all the time.

Hotels are a big Achilles heel for Copenhagen. I'm sure there are a few that are a bit personal; I just don't know of them. The place I send people to is called the Admiral. It's an old warehouse on the harbourside and if you're lucky, you'll get a room with beams everywhere, so you feel like you're in medieval Copenhagen. The service is gonna be crap, and the breakfast is gonna be shit – like anywhere in Copenhagen. Most of the time the Danes are not good at service. But the people are friendly.

A lot of people are immensely disappointed by the little mermaid – it's just a bronze statue lying on a rock. There's no show, no fountain: it's just there. But the walk to it, through the park, seeing all the churches, that's really nice.

In the second extract from her new book, Two Kitchens, Rachel Roddy turns to Sicily for inspiration, where food marks the seasons as keenly as any calendar and good food is as certain as the sunshine

Gela no longer has a central market, but a dispersed one that plays out all over the city, on corners and in laybys, out of front doors, windows and garages. A man and his son occupy the pitch at the end of our street, setting up their makeshift car-boot-and-crate stall on a corner that offers at least some shade from the often blinding sun. They sell one, maybe two things, depending on the season. But for us they are the “tomato two”, as during our long summer visits their corner is pure red, awash with round, deeply fluted tomatoes they call nostrani, which means “ours”.

So used are we to the red that it came as a shock when last week, arriving two weeks earlier than usual, we found the end of our street black and yellow. Yellow being the lozenge-shaped potatoes that really are waxy, and black the early aubergines, each one like a small, shining truncheon. As usual, the father was sitting on a upended crate, the son leaning against the car running his tongue over the tracks of braces on his teeth – which must be ready to come off by now.

“Tomatoes?” I ask.

“Dopo la Madonna,” the father replied. It took me a minute to adjust. Then I did, back to a city and family where so much life is patterned around saint and patron saint days, the most significant of which is Madonna delle Grazie, or Maria Santissima – several days of celebration and veneration that culminates in a procession on 2 July. The tomatoes will come afterwards, he was saying.

Two Kitchens: an exclusive extract from Rachel Roddy’s new book, part one Read more

We didn’t buy aubergines from the tomato two, walking instead to Rosa’s, whose garage-shop is the place I trust most. Her husband farms land almost exactly where my partner Vincenzo’s grandfather farmed, and in much the same way – what we might call biodynamic, but what he simply thought of as good farming. At Rosa’s we find a sea of green: lettuces, chard and great floppy bunches of tenerumi, which are the shoots, moleskin leaves and tendrils of a wonderfully phallic Sicilian courgette called cucuzza. No tomatoes though, the first having been besieged by uncharacteristic June heat and insects. They will be better after the Madonna, Rosa tells me. She does though, have aubergines, deep purple and shaped like small, slightly squashed pumpkins, which she also refers to as nostrani. “What will you make?” she asks.

Now, I have known Rosa and shopped in her garage with its blue and white striped curtain, blue water tank and freckled floor for three years. I have bought aubergines and talked about caponata many times. However, it seems we will again. Advice about how to prepare and cook certain things is spontaneous with Rosa, and it is all refreshingly unsentimental.

And she is not the only one; spontaneous advice is something I meet again and again in Sicily, and nowhere more than with caponata, the island’s quintessential aubergine and celery stew, whose sweet and savoury, boisterous and concentrated flavours seem the very essence of a Sicilian market. Rosa then goes upstairs to get me some of her caponata. She brings it down in a foil container protected by clingfilm and padded with a great wad of kitchen towel, so I can carry it home.

On the way, though, I stop for granita, which only really makes sense when it is hot, the crystals icy enough to make you catch your breath and cool you from inside. Our local bar has four flavours: a deep-burgundy and lip-staining gelsi (mulberry); an almond that is so luscious and so like cream you wonder if it contains some (it doesn’t); strong coffee; and limone – which is thankfully as sharp as it is sweet. I have lemon. If it was breakfast time, you might do as the Sicilians do and have a sweet, yeasted brioche too, the sort with a top knot that begs to be torn off and eaten with alternating spoonfuls of icy almond granita.

My lips numb, I can walk again, along the narrow grid of back streets, some of which are ruinous, others well-loved, bleached and strung with washing, all of which still have an almost labyrinthine ability to baffle me. I am always relieved to reach Via Buscemi, because I think of the actor Steve, and know I am nearly home.

Caponata

Every morning of the week except Sunday, Vincenzo’s grandmother Sara would wake at five o’clock to put the coffee on. By the time it was ready, her husband, Orazio, would have woken, washed and dressed, as he always did, in black trousers.

He would drink his coffee and eat a piece of bread before picking up a package and going downstairs. Until the early 1960s, the basement was a stable for his mule, Giuseppina, and later – once his eldest son, Totò, learned to drive – a home for the tractor that would take them both to the land they rented on the edge of the province. They would arrive in the field at about 6am and work until 10am, at which point he would open the package, which contained bread, tuna and caponata, that Sara had made, and a litre of his own wine.

Like her grandmother and mother before her, Sara made great quantities of caponata, the quintessential Sicilian stew. It’s a dish that makes absolute sense in Sicily: the abundance of aubergines, the tomato sauce families put asidepreserve each year, plentiful celery, olives and capers, the sweet-and-sour sugar and vinegar – about flavour as well as conserving. Like any dish made to a family recipe shaped by necessity, there are as many versions as cooks.

I make caponata often, both in Rome and London; it translates well anywhere. Like so much traditional Italian cooking, the key is choosing the right ingredients and to practice: tasting and trying again and again, adjusting the quantities to your taste, until you have a version y`ou really like. It’s important to fry the aubergines in plenty of hot oil (I use extra-virgin olive oil); the cubes should dance around the pan until golden. The finished dish needs to rest for at least an hour – ideally three. It’s even better the next day, and keeps well in the fridge for up to four. Traditionally, it would have been kept for much longer, and thus contained far more vinegar; it was bottled and put aside for the winter, more like a relish or pickle.

In my modern version, inspired by Sara and my friend (and food writer) Fabrizia Lanza, the ingredients are distinct, but united by a sauce rich with, but not overwhelmed by, tomato. I particularly like caponata as part of a picnic-style lunch with tuna, bread and wine. It has an affinity with roast meat, particularly lamb. It’s also good stirred into pasta or as the filling for a savoury tart.

Serves 6

Extra-virgin olive oil, or whatever oil you prefer to fry in

1kg aubergines, cut into 1-2cm cubes

4 celery stalks

75g capers, ideally packed in salt

150g olives (I like black Gaeta olives)

1 large red onion, thickly sliced

200ml tomato sauce or passata

75g raisins (optional)

50g pine nuts (optional)

50g sugar

50–75ml red wine vinegar

A small handful of basil leaves (optional)

1 Heat 5cm of oil in a small, deep, heavy-based frying pan until hot. Fry the diced aubergine in batches – do not crowd the pan – until golden brown, then drain on kitchen paper, sprinkle with salt and set aside. The oil can be strained and used to fry again.



2 Trim the celery stalks of any tough ends or strings and cut in half. Add the celery to a pan of boiling water and cook for about 5 minutes until tender, but still with bite. Drain. Once cool enough to handle, chop the celery into 1cm chunks and set aside. If the capers are salted, soak them for 2 minutes, then drain. If brined or in vinegar, drain and rinse. Pit the olives.

3 In a large, deep frying pan, warm 4 tbsp oil over a medium-low heat, add the onion and cook for 1-2 minutes. Add the tomato sauce and cook for another 2 minutes, then stir in the capers, olives, raisins and pine nuts.

4 Make a well in the middle of the pan and add the sugar and vinegar to it, allowing the sugar to dissolve in the heat. Stir and cook for 1-2 minutes, tasting to see if it needs more sugar or vinegar. Turn off the heat, add the aubergines and the celery and rip the basil into the pan. Stir gently, so the aubergine remains in distinct pieces. Leave to sit for at least 2 hours, or better still several, stirring gently once or twice.

Pasta with aubergine

In Catania, this is called pasta alla Norma in honour of the operatic masterpiece by Catania’s favourite son, Vincenzo Bellini. Others call it spaghetti alla coppola (spaghetti with a hat on). My Vincenzo calls it pasta con le melanzane, so I do too. It is a favourite (along with all the other favourites), especially in the summer, when it is made with vegetables that are full of sun. It can be a winter dish too, with tinned tomatoes and an unseasonal aubergine.

It was a good moment last year when I made this with a jar of tomatoes I had bottled the previous summer. I was aware – a bit embarrassed even – of my meagre output compared with nonna Sara’s extraordinary bottlings. Vincenzo, however, is moved by my efforts. This is his history, taken from one kitchen to another, a single taste that calls up the memory of his grandmother and Gela. Tradition demands spaghetti for Norma, but we often use thick tubes of ridged rigatoni.

Serves 4

2 large aubergines

Olive or groundnut oil, for frying

1kg fresh tomatoes or 500g passata

2 garlic cloves

A small handful of basil

1 tsp sugar (if you need it)

500g pasta, such as spaghetti, rigatoni, casarecce, mezze maniche or penne

200g salted ricotta, grated

Salt

1 Peel strips of skin from the aubergines so they are striped, then cut them into 5mm slices. If you’re going to salt them, do it now; otherwise just dry them with a clean tea towel. Heat about 5cm oil in a frying pan and fry the slices, turning them halfway, until they are golden brown on both sides, then drain on kitchen paper. Set aside, near the stove so they keep warmish.



2 Meanwhile, bring a large pan of water to the boil. If using fresh tomatoes, peel by plunging them into boiling water for 1 minute, then lift them out with a slotted spoon and cool under cold water, at which point the skins should slip away. Keep the hot water for cooking the pasta later. Roughly chop the tomatoes, removing the seeds if you wish (I don’t).

3 Crush the garlic cloves with the back of a knife, so they split, but remain whole. Warm some more oil in a frying pan and add the garlic. Once fragrant and lightly golden, remove from the pan, add the tomatoes (or passata) and cook until they collapse into a sauce. You can pass the tomatoes through a food mill back into the pan or, if you’re happy with the texture, simply tear in most of the basil, add the sugar if you think the sauce is too sharp, and a good pinch of salt.

4 Bring the pan of tomato water back to the boil, add salt, stir well and add the pasta. Cook it until al dente, then drain. Mix the pasta with the sauce and a handful of ricotta. Divide between bowls, top with several slices of aubergine, plus a little more salted ricotta and a couple more basil leaves. Pass around the remaining aubergine slices and cheese, so that people can help themselves.

Carmela’s beef rolls in tomato sauce

Behold – as you slice it – how the shining yellow of each egg yolk appears, set in its halo of white, flanked by the nebulae of lard, surrounded by the little green planets rotating across a milky way of caciocavallo… The Sicilian writer and poet Pino Correnti wrote about falsomagro in his book Il Libro D’Oro Della Cucina e Dei Vini di Sicilia. He considered it the undisputed king of Sicilian meat dishes: a large piece of beef wrapped around a filling of vegetables, chopped meat, cheese and hard-boiled egg, then simmered in tomato sauce. The name translates as “false lean”, possibly because its appearance from the outside promises something lean, but when you cut it open it is clear this is not the case: instead, you discover an almost baroque filling fit for a feast day, religious or otherwise.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest In Sicily, the braciole rolls are served alone, with bread for the sauce, but they also go very well with buttery mashed potatoes. Photograph: Rachel Roddy/Headline

Most families have their own version. Nowadays, rather than making one large falsomagro, my mother-in-law, Carmela, makes individual ones that are often called braciole. These are really just involtini, or meat rolls, with an egg inside. They don’t have quite the same “behold” moment as a large single roll, although the yolks still shine. Carmela, and I have made these together on many occasions, most recently in my kitchen, which proved itself to be wholly inadequate. No long tongs or kitchen roll, a knife that needs sharpening, no meat basher or oven glove, my salt too coarse, my pepper grinder too uptight.Realising that my hovering was as annoying as my grinder, I sat at the table and made notes. I noted the ingredients, of course, even though many of them were in qb – quanto basta – which means “however much is enough”, or use your common sense.

Carmela has no idea how amusing she is, especially when she is cross and using a rolling pin instead of a meat mallet. She is very specific about how to bash out the meat and snip away any muscles or fibres that might make it curl, about the arrangement of the carrot and celery and about the tying of the roll, for which she uses cotton that she keeps in her handbag – a tardis of useful things. Like so many stews and braises, braciole are better after a few hours’ rest – better still overnight. Just reheat the rolls gently. In Sicily, the rolls are served alone, with bread for the sauce. I love them with buttery mashed potatoes.

Serves 6

6 beef slices, such as fillet, topside or chuck (about 10 x 15cm and 6mm thick)

6 hard-boiled eggs, peeled

6 thin slices of prosciutto or mortadella

1 red onion, sliced into thin batons

1 celery stalk, sliced into thin batons

1 large carrot, sliced into thin batons

5 tbsp olive oil

1 small white onion, chopped

150ml red wine

700ml smooth tomato sauce or passata

1 Prepare the beef slices, if necessary pounding (or rather gently extending or stretching) them until thin, then nick the edges of each slice to stop them curling in the pan.

2 Make sure your reel of cotton is close to hand and, ideally, enlist the help of another person for the tying. Spread the beef slices out on a clean work surface. Lay the prosciutto on top of the beef, making sure you leave a margin around the edge, and place an egg in the bottom half of the slice. Arrange bundles of carrot, celery and onion around the egg, tucking them in close. Bring the bottom of the slice up and over the egg, then roll it, tucking the sides in as best you can, until you have a neat, plum-like cylinder.

3 Secure the roll with a double piece of cotton as if you were tying a parcel; lengthways first, then the sides. Repeat, so the ends are well sealed.

4 Warm the olive oil in a large, deep frying or saute pan, then fry the white onion until soft and translucent.

5 Add the beef rolls and fry, turning as required, until they are brown. Add the wine and let it sizzle, then add the tomato sauce and a pinch of salt. Reduce the heat and let the rolls simmer, half-covered, turning them every now and then, until they are cooked through, which usually takes about 1 hour. Let them sit for a while, then reheat gently before serving.

Cherries in syrup with bay leaves

“There is always a chance it will explode,” said my friend Gabriella, her almost-smile suggesting that the possibility of cherries, wine and sugar seeping between the terracotta tiles and dripping through her roof was a risk she was prepared to take. We were in Abruzzo, sitting at her table after a very long, very good dinner at their agriturismo (farmhouse inn) in the hills near Loreto Aprutino. Before us was a small glass of inky-purple liquid: Gabriella’s sour cherry liqueur, made by steeping sour cherries in Montepulciano d’Abruzzo and sugar in a large, teardrop-shaped glass bottle on the roof for 40 days and 40 nights during high summer. As we tried not to slide under the table, I wondered how Gabriella put the bottles on the roof, how she got the steeped cherries out of the bottle and what she did with them, and could I have another glass? One answer came the following morning, when we were served the steeped cherries, wrinkled, dark and boozy, on ricotta.

Nine months later, in Rome, the first of the cherries, some crimson, others deep purple, have splattered the market with colour and we have been eating them greedily by the kilogram, spitting stones into our fists and grabbing another handful in a sort of cherry race. Then, at the small farmers’ market in the old slaughterhouse, I found the first of the sour cherries, paler than usual, sweet as much as sour, reminiscent of almonds and almost the wrong side of perfect ripeness.

Back home, I remembered Gabriella’s roof and followed my instincts. I put them in a pan, along with a few sweet cherries, bay leaves, red wine and some sugar, then let it all bubble into a fragrant, syrupy, shirt-staining stew.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sour cherries steeped in wine with bay leaves: ‘a fragrant, syrupy, shirt-staining stew.’ Photograph: Rachel Roddy/Headline

Serves 4

400g pitted cherries, ideally a mixture of sweet and sour

300ml red wine

130g sugar

3 bay leaves

1 Put everything in the pan at the same time, bring slowly to the boil, then reduce to a simmer for about 12 minutes, or until the cherries are completely tender. If the sauce is not thick enough, lift the cherries out and set them aside, reduce until it is the thickness you like, then return the cherries to the pan.

2 Serve with a partner, such as a slice of fresh ricotta; the combination with soft, creamy cheese, the dark red and the white, is stunning. Eat them also with mascarpone, Greek yoghurt or next to a plain cake. They will keep for a week in a sealed jar in the fridge.

Lemon pudding

This is my friend Cinzia’s recipe for sbriciolata alla crema di limoni, the literal translation of which is: “crumbs around a lemon cream”, which really is the best description since none of the other possibilities are quite right. The lemon cream is typically southern Italian, and therefore thickened with a little flour, which gives it an old-fashioned and homely feel, especially if you are used to more elegant, butter-rich lemon curds.

1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Grease a 28cm shallow cake or tart tin and dust with flour. Pare the zest of 3 lemons in strips. Squeeze the juice and keep for later. Warm the milk and zest in a small pan. Leave to sit for 1 hour, then lift out the zest.

2 Meanwhile, make the crumbs. In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Dice the butter and add it along with the egg, then use cold fingertips to rub the butter and egg into the flour until the mixture resembles fat breadcrumbs. Sprinkle half the crumbs over the base of the prepared tin to make a nice, even layer.

3 Bake on the bottom shelf for a few minutes, or until the crumbs are firm and pale gold. Set aside to cool.

4 In another large bowl, whisk the yolks and sugar to a thick cream, then sift over the flour and starch. Mix until smooth. Whisk in about 150ml lemon juice.

5 Warm the milk a little, then, whisking constantly, add it to the egg and flour mixture in a thin stream. Return the mixture to the pan and cook over a low heat, whisking, for about 15 minutes, until it coats the back of the spoon. Grate the zest of the final lemon into the cream.

6 Spread the cream over the crumb base, leaving a 1cm border. Cover with the rest of the crumbs. Bake for 25 minutes, or until the crumbs are firm and golden. It must be absolutely cool if you want to turn it out. Even then you must do so carefully by inverting it on to a plate, then on to another plate so the golden crust faces up. Serve at room temperature or chilled.

Sweet yeasted buns

A tuppo is a bun, which, as in English, is also the word you use to describe hair when coiled up on your head. So you could describe Sicily’s brioche col tuppo, or sweet yeasted breakfast bread, as a bun with a bun. The buns with buns in our local bar are almost fantastically terrible pale things, suffocating in a plastic wrapper and tasting faintly of banana – yet another reminder of how dislocated industrialisation and convenience is sweeping Sicily.

Gagliano, the owner, apologises for his brioche; once there was a bakery in Gela that made them fresh, but now he buys them from a factory. As if to make up for the buns, the almond granita he makes and serves with the brioche is some of the best I have ever tasted: a pale, icy cream with bits of whole almond served in a wide glass on a saucer. It is a ritual so fine that I am happy to forget the brioche, almost.

In our regular bar in Catania, the brioche are comely and burnished. I wouldn’t think of making brioche if I lived nearby. But I don’t; instead I dream of eating them, which prompts me to make them from time to time. Brioche need an eight-hour rise, the thought of which makes my heart sink a little, but – like jumping in the water or going for a brisk walk – that doubt disappears as soon as you begin, and is replaced by the smell of yeast, then the dough. I tend to make brioche in winter – so, not for serving with granita, but with milky coffee and a real newspaper.

Makes 10–12

100ml milk

5g dried yeast or 15g fresh yeast

500g plain flour or soft wheat OO-flour

140g sugar

5 eggs, lightly beaten

150g soft lard or butter, at room temperature

Sugar, for glazing

Salt

1 Warm the milk until tepid, then dissolve the yeast in it. Sift the flour into a bowl, stir in the sugar and a pinch of salt. Add the milk-yeast mixture and 4 of the eggs. Mix. Add the lard or butter and work until the mixture is consistent. Knead firmly for 5 minutes, pausing, if you like, to lift and then throw the dough on to the work surface, which apparently helps with elasticity. Put the dough in a bowl, cover it with clingfilm and chill in the fridge for 8–10 hours.

2 Line a baking tray with parchment. Split the dough into 10 equal parts. Pull off a small piece of each part and roll it into a smaller ball. Shape the larger piece into a round, slightly flat ball and make an indent in the top. Press the small ball into the indent. Transfer the brioche to the baking tray. Repeat with the remaining dough.

3 Whisk the last egg with a little sugar, then brush on to the brioche. Leave to rise in a warm, non-draughty spot for another 75 minutes, by which time they should have doubled in size.

4 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Before baking, brush the brioche with more of the egg-sugar mixture. Bake for 15–20 minutes, or until the brioche are golden.

Ricotta, honey and pistachios

This is an excellent breakfast, and without the toast it makes a lovely pudding too, possibly with fruit – pears and figs go particularly well.

Serves 1

Ricotta

A little milk

Slices of toast

Pistachios, lightly crushed

Honey

1 Whip the ricotta with a little milk to make it softer and more spoonable.



2 Spoon it on to a slice of toast, sprinkle with pistachios and drizzle with honey.

Lemon granita

Writing this in February has me wondering who on earth is going to bother with the palaver of it all, the grating and sliding the plastic box in and out of the freezer?

We will, of course, once the heat has us moving slowly around the kitchen, our bare feet enjoying the cold tiles and faces welcoming the wave of cold air that comes from the open freezer door. One summer in Umbria, my brother Ben and I spent entire afternoons between the pool and the freezer, waiting for the moment when the granita was perfect, the glassy sweet-sharp crystals like snow. Lemon granita is best served in a little glass.

When I make sugar syrup I usually make a large quantity in a 2:1 ratio of sugar to water. Warm the water in a pan over a low heat – it must not boil or even get to a lively simmer – add half the sugar and stir until it dissolves, then add the other half and stir until there are no granules left. I usually make more than I need and keep the rest in a bottle in the fridge. A dash of vodka helps it last longer.

Serves 4–6

4 unwaxed lemons

80ml sugar syrup (see above)

1 To make the granita, grate the zest from 2 lemons, then squeeze the juice from all four. Measure the juice and top up to 900ml with water, then add the sugar syrup and zest.

2 If you have an ice-cream machine, pour the mixture in and follow the instructions for granita. Otherwise, tip the mixture into a shallow, plastic freezerproof container and slide into the freezer. After 1 hour, as the mixture is starting to freeze, stir it with a fork and slide it back in. Repeat this every 30 minutes, stirring and scraping the mixture down from the sides with a fork as it starts to get harder. The idea is to end up with an icy slush, which takes about 4 hours. If the granita freezes over completely, you can blitz it into glassy crystals in a food processor.

The House of Commons’ new dress code is less restrictive than many gentlemen’s clubs. But is the ubiquitous open-collar look simply a phase in the garment’s evolution? And could high fashion offer a lifeline?

It was president John F Kennedy who took the credit and the blame for the demise of the hat, after he declined to wear a topper to his inauguration in 1960. Before long, the only American men who wore headgear to work were beat cops and construction workers.

Now, the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, has threatened the primacy of the necktie in British public life, telling MPs they can speak in the chamber without one – and thus making the parliamentary dress code more progressive than that of several nearby gentlemen’s clubs.

So will ties soon go the way of top hats? On Tuesday, transport minister John Hayes told the Commons he would ignore interventions from any “sartorially challenged” male MP not sporting a tie. Hayes, a member of the traditionalist Tory Cornerstone group, even brought a spare for others to borrow. But he was challenged by tieless Lib Dem Tom Brake, who urged him to “bow to the inevitable and accept the tyranny of the tie has been terminated”.

David Cameron was the first frontline British politician to ditch the tie on a regular basis (outside parliament, that is) as he rose to the leadership of the Conservative party a dozen years ago with his sleeves rolled up and his top button boldly undone.

He encouraged other Tory frontbenchers to do the same, presumably hoping voters would see a group of relaxed, regular guys, instead of the ties that might mark them out as Old Etonians or members of the Garrick Club. Yet in his brief pomp, between the 2015 election and the Brexit referendum, Cameron reverted to type, telling Jeremy Corbyn from the dispatch box that he ought to “put on a proper suit” and “do up [his] tie”. After observing election battles on both sides of the Atlantic, distinguished historian Sir David Cannadine noted in 2012 that British and American politicians tended to “campaign wearing an open neck shirt, but govern wearing a tie”.

Alex Bilmes, the editor of Esquire, has little patience for the suit-with-no-tie look, which he describes as a crutch for “any square, middle-aged executive type who wants to signal that they’re not just a stuffed shirt. Who are you kidding, grandad? There’s something fake and insincere about removing the tie to suggest everything’s relaxed and laid back.”

Stripping the tie from traditional, formal, men’s business attire, says Bilmes, “takes away almost the only signal of individuality. You’ve removed all pattern, colour and wit from the look. The tie is the focal point of the ensemble. It’s like the Rolling Stones without Mick standing in the middle. Sometimes I’ll watch Newsnight and the presenter and all his guests – academics, newspaper editors, senior MPs – they’re all wearing blue, single-breasted suits with a white shirt open at the collar. There’s no way to tell them apart. It looks like Match of the Day, frankly. It shows an aesthetic ignorance and a lack of style.”

The history of the necktie can be traced at least as far back as the 17th century, when fashionable Parisians took a fancy to the knotted neckerchiefs worn by the Croatian mercenaries who fought for the French during the thirty years’ war. They were adopted by the French and turned into what we would think of today as a cravat. The necktie as we know it became popular in the early 20th century, and particularly after the first world war, when, for many returning soldiers, a regimental tie replaced the bow tie as day-to-day formalwear.

In the US in the 1920s, Brooks Brothers became the go-to men’s outfitter for the professional classes. The firm modelled its ties for Wall Street workers and other businessmen on British club and regimental ties, but designed them with diagonal stripes that move down from left to right, the opposite of the conventional British diagonal, and a distinction that still sets British and US ties apart today.

Cameron, a former Carlton Television PR man, took his style cues from the creative industries, the tech business and even the hedge-fund world, where many powerful men go tieless to meetings. But the no-tie look may be simply a phase in the evolutionary history of the necktie, which has already survived bolo, kipper and piano varieties.

According to Jack Cassidy, a buyer of men’s designer and formalwear at Selfridges, the market for ties is not shrinking but diversifying, with ties breaking out of their traditional home in the formalwear section.

The tie is integral to any formal outfit, says Cassidy, “but in recent seasons we have also seen this symbol of the corporate world make its way on to the fashion stage, with the likes of Martine Rose and Balenciaga making it a key focus point of their AW17 collections. This season at Selfridges, the tie will take a sabbatical alongside our most avant-garde labels [in the designer-wear space], with options from Thom Browne, Dries Van Noten and Balenciaga.”

It will be interesting to witness the long-term effect of the current US president on the life of the tie. Far from eschewing the silk noose, Donald Trump wears a tie everywhere he goes – the golf course notwithstanding – and at such preposterous length that it has been described as both a guide to the location of his penis, and as an attempt to compensate for its size.

Trump’s ties and his knee-length suit jackets are an extreme incarnation of the style preferred by a traditional American executive class. “The American boardroom is not where one goes for sartorial tips,” Bilmes admits. “And Trump is not a fantastic advert for tie wearers.”

If the tie finally goes out of fashion for good, history may hold President Trump responsible. On the other hand, he has done more than most presidents to help bring back the hat.

First, the Queen wore a hat instead of her traditional crown to the state opening of parliament – and the ravens did not abandon the Tower of London in shock. Now it appears another bastion of tradition could be about to fall: the requirement of men to wear neckties in the House of Commons.



After some of the hottest June days on record – when even Ascot permitted men to remove their jackets during the royal race week – the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, who has until now been seen as a stickler for correct dress, has indicated to the Tory MP Peter Bone that the convention requiring male MPs to wear jackets and ties may be abandoned.

Losing the tie is just a start. Now MPs must hang up their suits | Simon Chilvers Read more

The House of Commons press office said the wearing of jackets and ties in the House was a relatively modern convention and as such it was within the Speaker’s power to rule on it.



Guidelines issued by the Speaker to MPs about their conduct also make it clear that tie-wearing is merely a custom: “There is no exact dress code. Convention has been that for men, a jacket and tie is expected; for women the equivalent level of formality should be observed.”

Erskine May’s Treatise on the Law, Privileges, Proceedings and Usage of Parliament, regarded as the last word on parliamentary etiquette, makes it clear that wearing a tie and suit jacket is a custom, not a rule.

“Members are not permitted to wear decorations in the House,” the text says. “The wearing of military insignia or uniform inside the chamber is not in accordance with the long-established custom of the House. It remains the custom for gentlemen members to wear jackets and ties, but the Speaker has not enforced the practice in all circumstances.”

A similar debate is also happening in the French parliament, where many new leftwing MPs turned up for the new session without ties. Jean Luc Mélénchon, leader of the Insoumise party, compared his open-collared followers to the Sans Culottes, the working class of the French Revolution: “We’ve had the Sans Culottes, now we have the Sans Cravates,” he said.

Tory MP Bone, who has held the Wellingborough seat since 2005 and is a member of the 1922 Committee, is regarded as a rightwing serial contrarian. For a time he sported a lurid green-striped “Grassroots Out” pro-Brexit tie in the Commons, provoking the Speaker to say: “It’s a very garish item, I’m bound to say, but who am I to object to that?”

Last December Bone briefly donned what some observers dubbed a pink “tea cosy” in the chamber – actually a wildly striped South American hat with tassels and ear flaps – to promote a breast cancer charity’s crazy hats day in his constituency.

Bercow warned him: “I have indulged the honourable gentleman for the duration of his question, but I am glad he has now taken that hat off and I sincerely hope he never puts it on again, at least in this House.”

Last October Bone provoked one of Theresa May’s rare jokes, when she wished him a happy birthday during prime minister’s questions, adding “I hope that Mrs Bone is going to treat the occasion in the appropriate manner”, before looking startled at the guffaws coming from both sides of the House.

In 2014 another hot and bothered Tory MP, Henry Smith, tweeted “Can we please, even if just today, wear shorts instead of suits in the Commons? Struggling with the hot air, externally (and internally)!”

On the hottest days, when the Palace of Westminster’s primitive air conditioning system is showing its limitations, male MPs have often looked enviously at their bare-armed female colleagues. Many women have interpreted the “equivalent level of formality” guidance as an unofficial uniform of brightly coloured jackets and dresses, in loyal party colours for special occasions. Some have been rebuked for wearing slogan T-shirts.

In 2013 Labour’s Harriet Harman got away with a brief appearance in a “This is what a feminist looks like” T-shirt. However the Green MP Caroline Lucas – who wasn’t even in the chamber, merely at a debate in Westminster Hall –was rebuked in the same year for her “No More Page Three” slogan shirt.

Bercow, recently reappointed to the position he has held since 2010, has been something of a dress code reformist himself, choosing to wear a jacket, collar and tie under his black gown; the full splendorous Speaker’s uniform, last regularly worn by Bernard Weatherill in the early 1990s, consisted of tights, knee breeches, long black waistcoat, linen collar, cuffs and neck band, and a long wig.

• This article was amended on 30 June 2017. An earlier version referred to the Sans Culottes as “trouserless”. In fact they wore pantalon (trousers) instead of the culotte (silk breeches) worn by the upper classes.

Armchair critics didn’t respond well to Lawson’s tomato-and-salad-cream meal, but from strawberries and cream to egg-fried-rice or steak and chips, two elements is more than enough to make a delicious dish

As if we needed further proof that there is nothing that people on social media can’t get angry about, Nigella Lawson came under fire this week for posting a link to an innocuous-looking recipe for an old-fashioned tomato salad – boasting, her outraged audience claimed, just two ingredients. “I REALLY hope this is a joke!?” one Facebook commenter reacted. “This is a dish of cherry tomatoes ... with a squirt of salad cream ... get over yourself for goodness sake.”

Another critic claimed to be “lost for words” over Lawson’s cheek in recommending “tomatoes and salad cream”. Few, however, actually bothered to click through to the recipe itself, featuring a salad cream containing no fewer than nine ingredients, which is, I can confirm, a good deal nicer than the gloop sold under that venerable name.

Homemade or Heinz, however, there is no shame in simplicity. Ask someone about their favourite foods and you will rarely hear a hymn to the joys of tournedos rossini, or three textures of cauliflower. Hot buttered toast, strawberries and cream, rice and dal, or yes, a simply dressed, gloriously ripe tomato – for most of us, this is the stuff of true pleasure.

And, although Lawson’s salad may not be one of them, there are plenty of great meals that use only two ingredients. Porridge for example – all you need for perfection is oats, milk and patience. And many great breakfasts can be created with eggs and a knob of butter – make an omelette, and you can call it lunch, add potatoes and you’ve got yourself a feast.

Pasta with butter or good olive oil is a very fine thing indeed, especially if you have black pepper in the cupboard, as is a big bowl of egg-fried rice. Fondue needs only cheese and white wine (although a bit of stale bread would be welcome) and who would argue that steak and chips should involve more than beef and fried potatoes?

Although I’ll admit “Open tub. Add spoon” doesn’t quite count as a recipe for my favourite way to enjoy ice-cream, whizzing frozen ripe bananas in a food processor demands little more in the way of effort, and you can always add a dollop of peanut butter or a pinch of cinnamon if you really want to impress. An excellent chocolate sauce that sets satisfyingly solid on hitting said ice cream can be made from chocolate and coconut oil – or chocolate can be turned into truffles with the help of double cream, or mousse with nothing more than a drop of hot water.

Humble pie, however, is probably one recipe that’s a bit beyond Lawson’s armchair critics.

Nigella Lawson received criticism from fans after sharing a recipe for a dish they claimed was “just tomatoes and salad cream”.

The celebrity chef shared instructions for her “Old Fashioned Tomato Salad” on social media on Tuesday.

However, the dish, which includes cherry tomatoes, chives and dressing, did not go down well with some foodies.

One Facebook user wrote: “I REALLY hope this is a joke!? This is a dish of cherry tomatoes cut in half, with a squirt of salad cream...get over yourself for goodness sake.”

Another added : “Your giving your mind a treat here. Some chopped up tomatoes with some dressing? You need to your game love you can do much better than that and you know it.”

One fan wrote on Twitter: “Tomato and salad cream......it's tomatoes and salad cream......lost for words.”

Some people jumped to the chefs defence with one writing: “The recipe is how to make your own salad cream ... did you not read it before you commented? Jeez people of all the things to rage against in this life this isn't one of them.”

Raclette grills are one good thing that skiers are on to. These make a glorious meal designed by a ravening stoner, and you don’t need to be a posh jock to enjoy it

What?

The Cookut raclette cheese set comprises round wooden baseboards with cutaway collar, lidded with non-stick mini-pans. Uses live flame to liquefy curds.

Why?

Jolyon and Jemima need fondue, too.

Well?

I have never understood winter sports, but am horrifically compelled by those who do. My fascination is something to do with the 100% certainty of serious injury, the hideous bulk of the jackets, plus the moronic language surrounding it all. I once went through a phase of signing out of every conversation – the more mundane and office-based the better – with the words: “I’m gonna hit the powder,” in the manner of a snow-berk. (Had to retire the catchphrase once I started working in the media, where it was widely misunderstood, and people kept following me into the bathroom.) Yet I have to concede there is one area in which the skiers are undeniably on to something good: the raclette grills on which they traditionally melt slabs of Swiss cheese, which are then slid over potatoes, cold cuts and cornichons. A meal designed by a ravening stoner, elevated to upper class ritual. Is it possible to make such a cuisine truly elegant? No, it isn’t. However, French company Cookut is giving it a square go, with its set of four circular raclette ramikins. “Une Savoureuse Raclette a la Bougie,” the box declares, boldly. Yes, I think to myself, I can be bougie.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest The fondue doesn’t stop. Photograph: Graeme Robertson

The raclettes themselves are basically mini-fondue pots, with classy, stencil-etched patterning. Don’t get me wrong: initially, the setup looks like Lord Buckethead sired a bunch of mini-buckets, then put cheese on their heads; but that is before I place two lit tealights inside each. Their lambent glow makes me feel as if I’m preparing a Japanese tea ceremony, rather than cheesy chips. On top, the fromage bubbles, and I use the lil’ spade to ladle it on my spuds. Sticking the cornichons on, I faceplant the whole lot. Glorious, classy as heck, and you don’t need to be a posh jock to enjoy it. Raclette, set and match. Or whatever they say in snowsports. “Ow, my spine?” Let’s go with that.

Any downside?

One of those items you buy as a gift, discover you can melt cheese on, and keep for yourself. But people love getting random perfumes and Guylian seashells instead, so it’s fine.

Counter, drawer, back of the cupboard?

So into it! It’s the greatest! I’m gonna hit the powder! 4/5

If you’re really serious about competitive running, there are companies that test your DNA to determine your sporting potential. But does it work?

Growing up, I was always the dumpy, unsporty one. Matt, my older brother, was the skinny one who did the running, jumping and anything requiring quickness and coordination. He seemed to excel with ease while I laboured away on a sluggish course towards sub-mediocrity. This pattern lasted until our late teens when Matt, being older, beat me to booze. While he was away on a year-long, round-the-world bender, I took up running — with a vengeance. It was time to turn the tables.



By the time Matt got back, I’d joined the local running club and was training every day. It turned out that becoming a competent runner didn’t require special talent, just lots of miles – driven on by the sense I was outrunning my former, slouchy self. Matt, visibly shaken by my transformation, threw himself into training to catch up – stymied by his three-kilo beer belly.



'The biggest shock is my aerobic potential, rated "low". OK, I'm no Mo Farah, but but surely my aerobic capacity is at least middling'

We’ll skip the gory details – the dozens of races where I beat Matt with ease – and fast-forward to 2012. I had been training consistently for six years by now. Matt was swiftly catching up, but I still had a clear edge in any race of more than10 miles, so I decided to step up to the marathon. After putting in the hardest three months’ training of my life, I came away with a shiny new PB of 2hr 28 min 46 sec.

The point is not to revel in my glory. My time was decent club standard but hardly impressive against “proper” British marathoners, let alone African elites. The point is, it was amazing for me, given my widely presumed lack of ability. If only I had realised sooner that I had the potential …



Imagine someone had tested my genes as a podgy kid and told me: don’t worry, you’re an athlete inside, it’s only your Sherbet Dip Dab habit holding you back. What wonderful reassurance and motivation that would have been. But wait. What if they had looked at my results and said: sorry, it’s not through lack of effort that you are sub-mediocre – it’s down to your DNA. What then?



I was intrigued to find companies offering to do just that – test my DNA to determine my sporting potential. Could it really work? I decided to find out.



I got in touch with DNAFit, the leading provider, and asked if they would blind-test my DNA plus a few other samples. To my surprise, they said yes. A call to some friends with connections in elite sport secured a sample from a multi-Olympian and world champion runner (on condition I wouldn’t reveal his identity) — let’s call him Mr Swift — and another from pro cyclist James McLaughlin. If their results tallied with their achievements, I figured, DNA testing would be worth taking notice of.



Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mr Swift’s ‘medium’ result

A few weeks later the results were in. Swift’s read as follows: “Aerobic potential: medium”, which qualified as “an intermediate VO2max tendency”. Yet according to his physiologist, Swift’s VO2max is “above 77” – quite definitely not an intermediate score. Furthermore, the report deems his power/endurance profile as favouring power over endurance by a ratio of 70/30. Swift is one of the greatest endurance runners in the history of the sport. His injury risk, marked “medium”, is also at odds with the actual evidence. “He has had many, many injuries,” his physiologist confides. “I’d say his injury risk is untypically high.”



McLaughlin’s results are similarly at odds with his track record: his aerobic potential is rated “medium”, with a slight tendency towards power over endurance. “It doesn’t ring true at all,” McLaughlin tells me. “My VO2max is very high, nearly 82, and I’m a pure endurance rider – I fare far better in long, sustained efforts than in sprints.”



My own results also suggest a predisposition towards power rather than endurance, 56/47. This flies in the face of my running experience: I am hopeless at shorter, power-based events; the longer the race, the better I do (relative to others). The biggest shock is my aerobic potential, rated “low”. OK, I’m no Mo Farah, but surely my aerobic capacity is at least middling, or how could I have run a sub-2hr 30min marathon?



I owe it to DNAFit to give them a chance to explain – after all, they have been generous in blind-testing samples, opening themselves up to journalistic scrutiny. The company’s head of sport science is the former Olympic sprinter Craig Pickering, to whom I reveal the disparities between our results and our sporting track records.



“You almost certainly can’t use genes to tell who will be a good athlete or not a good athlete,” he responds. “There is no talent identification use in this.”

Fair enough, but our world-class marathon runner was rated as having “medium” aerobic potential.

“That’s a great example of how you can’t use genetics to tell you what sport you’ll be good at.”

OK, fine, so what can genetic testing tell us?



“What the tests and reports do is give you information on which to base your training, to have a better informed programme.”

Citing one DNAFit-supported study on a small group of athletes, Pickering says that the results provide enough information to guide training, either towards power (short, sharp) or endurance (longer, slower) sessions. This insight, he says, relates to genetically determined trainability – rate of fitness gain – rather than aptitude. Yet this wasn’t the impression I had been given by the reports, covered as they are with the word “potential”.

I stress my concern to Pickering that, had I received my apparently bleak results as a newcomer to running, my athletic ambitions might have been crushed. But he thinks I am missing the subtleties. “Because you have a low aerobic potential … we have options, we can fine-tune and target other areas like movement economy and efficiency.”

Low aerobic potential? We know that marathoners rely on their aerobic capacity, so surely this implies that my prospects were limited. “No, that isn’t what it means,” he replies. “I accept that ‘potential’ does imply that. The title should be changed. I often call it your aerobic trainability.”

By by this point, I have to admit, I am erring towards unconvinced. My scepticism deepens when I read the Athlome Project’s consensus statement on direct-to-consumer (DTC) DNA tests:

“The information provided by DTC is virtually meaningless for prediction and/or optimisation of sport performance. There is currently no evidence that existing genetic tests provide information that is useful regarding either predisposition for a particular sport, prediction of the training response likely to occur to a particular training programme, or predisposition to exercise-related injury.”

Athlome’s founder, Professor Yannis Pitsiladis, is even more damning: “These results are pointless, throw them away. There are no grounds for any of it.”



According to Pitsiladis, although there is vast, exciting scope for genetics-guided training, the science has a very long way to go: “We’re beginning to understand that performance is determined by hundreds, possibly even thousands of interacting genes. Even once they are known, we may not be able to make predictions with clinical significance; we will need to take into account the environmental factors as well.”

Countering the criticism from Pitsiladis and his Athlome colleagues, Pickering alleges sour grapes: “They’re annoyed that we’ve done it before them and that’s why they’re causing these problems. Their main goal was to sell genetic tests to people, in my opinion. They are frustrated that we’re one or two years ahead of them.”

Pitsiladis doesn’t deny having commercial interests in genetic testing but insists he is involved only in areas with demonstrable utility, such as using genetics to create improved anti-doping tests. He draws a sharp distinction between genetically testing elite athletes to assess their shared traits and testing amateurs who are almost as diverse a group as the general population.



“Parents who’ve failed as athletes go buy this stuff, desperate for their kids to succeed … Selling direct to consumers is the problem.”

That is precisely my concern, too. Can’t Pickering appreciate that for people such as myself, starting out as the unsporty sibling with every reason to doubt my genetic potential, my gloomy test results could have snuffed out my marathon dreams before I had even tried a 5k run?



“I share your concern,” he replies. “It’s something that, as a company, we try to communicate. Our reports use the word potential, and that needs to change … We have to do a better job, and we’ll continue to try.”

Make no mistake, talent matters. Athletes such as McLaughlin and Swift are prodigiously genetically blessed. My older brother, too, is a natural. He overtook me and became a far superior athlete, as I always suspected he would. But being the best you can be isn’t about biology, it is art as much as science. Talent isn’t destiny decipherable from DNA; it waits to be realised through hard work, like a sculpture inside a boulder. So don’t let anyone put you off – get hammering.

Huawei has achieved something quite special with its new laptop that is one of the lightest around without sacrificing power



Huawei’s new MateBook X laptop looks like a minimalist Apple MacBook on the outside, but brings full-power laptop specifications in a fanless design to create a beautiful, capable machine.

Huawei’s second Windows PC continues the trend of bringing smartphone-inspired design to the computer market. The MateBook X is a super-thin, light and powerful PC encased in aluminium. It’s a very attractive design that looks and feels like a premium product, bringing Huawei’s PC efforts right up with the best of the competition, including Apple’s MacBook and MacBook Pro.

The deck of the laptop has a fairly large and accurate trackpad with all the gestures, a set of good feeling and well-made back-lit chiclet keys, a grille above the keyboard and the power button on the right. It’s all very minimalist.

The screen is great, with small bezels, good viewing angles and a fairly good anti-reflective coating that makes it easier to use than some rivals – including the Surface Laptop – in office or outdoors environments. It’s bright enough for most environments: it’s pin sharp and looks great. The screen’s 3:2 ratio means it’s easier to be productive with split-screen apps, but watching widescreen video isn’t as good because of the need for large black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. But it’s not a touchscreen, which is a shame as there are lots of things that are faster to do simply by tapping on the screen within Windows 10 and I found myself missing the feature that’s pretty much standard on every portable machine with Windows 10.

The webcam is in the right place at the top of the screen, not hidden down on the bottom like some thin-bezel designs, but it’s not Windows Hello enabled. The MateBook X has a fingerprint reader hidden under the power button instead.

The speakers are some of the best I’ve heard on any laptop and are hidden in the body. They’re loud, clear and while not quite what I’d call room-filling, they’re more than up to the task of watching a TV show in the kitchen over the sounds of a cooker hood fan going. Huawei partnered with Dolby on them and they are part of the new Atmos Sound System range, but don’t expect a cinema-like experience; they’re only laptop speakers.

With the lid shut it feels solid and its small frame, 1kg weight and rounded edges make it easy to cart about and slip into a bag.

Huawei has achieved something quite special by fitting in full-blooded laptop “U-series” seventh-generation Intel Core i5 and i7 chips into a fanless design that dissipates heat using some clever phase-change materials. As such the MateBook X is completely silent at all times.

Most fanless designs, including Apple’s MacBook, have to use Intel’s lower-power Core M or newer “Y-series” Core i5 or i7 chips, which while capable of light duties, crunch when doing more serious image editing or processor intensive tasks for any amount of time longer than a few minutes.

Testing with the Core i5 version of the MateBook X, it stayed cool to the touch during office duties of browsing the web and using web apps in Chrome, image editing in Affinity Photo, using Evernote and Windows Mail, while typing into minimalist text-editing app Typora.

Downloading large games in Steam at around 30-60Mbps caused the bottom to heat up a little, running X-Com 2 caused it to heat up quite a lot meaning you wouldn’t want to play on your lap or for very long. But the MateBook X was eminently capable throughout and will be able to handle pretty much anything you’d want to throw at it.

Even playing some games with low detail levels was just about possible; the same that could be said of pretty much any laptop with a seventh-generation Core i5 and Intel HD 620 integrated graphics chip, but barely any of them are this thin and light while at the same time fanless.

Battery life

Using the MateBook X for office duties, with under a dozen tabs open in Chrome, image editing in Affinity Photo, text editing in Typora and the odd bit of Spotify streaming, the laptop would last just under seven hours between charges with recommended brightness and power settings. That isn’t quite long enough to last a full work day or to leave the charger at home, but being USB-C means you can power it up using any higher-powered USB-C charger and the Huawei power brick is one of the smallest available. Charging the laptop to full battery while still using it took around two hours.

One issue that needs to be pointed out with the MateBook X is that not all versions of the machine come with a trusted platform module (TPM) – the small chip built into the machine that securely stores encryption keys. Those versions without a TPM will not be able to enable Microsoft’s hard drive encryption system, BitLocker, without circumventing security protocols. Whether that matters to you depends on how you view your data, but I would not use a computer that I could not encrypt the contents of the hard drive in case of theft, as I don’t want my photos, my data, emails and other personal bits of information falling into the hands for thieves.

USB-C-only

Facebook Twitter Pinterest USB-C on one side, another USB-C and headphones socket on the other. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian

The MateBook X only has two USB-C ports. The one on the left of the machine doubles as the power port, the one on the right can accept the bundled dongle, which provides USB-C pass-through as well as a USB-A port, VGA and HDMI out, but not an ethernet port.

Having two USB-C ports is certainly better than just one and helps futureproof the MateBook X, while including an adapter dongle in the box helps ease the transition from legacy USB-A and other connections. Those with older peripherals will be confined to a life filled with dongles in the immediate future.

Windows 10 Pro or Home

The Matebook X either comes with Windows 10 Home or Windows 10 Pro depending on location and model. The only notable addition to Microsoft’s OS is the MateBook Manager, which handles driver updates, enables some intelligent power-saving modes and flags power-draining apps, which in my case was always Chrome.

MateBook Manager also links up with Huawei smartphones to provide instant hotspots using a Huawei ID, can share files via Bluetooth to other Huawei devices, and handles system backups to external drives.

Fingerprint scanner

Facebook Twitter Pinterest All you need is to tap the power button for the fingerprint scanner to work - it’s the best on a laptop to date. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian

The power button doubles as a fingerprint scanner, which is a great idea. Press it, put your finger on it and it instantly unlocks the computer. It’s the best fingerprint scanner I’ve used on a computer and easily as good as the Huawei’s smartphone fingerprint sensors – the best in the business.

Observations

There’s a small rough edge where the base plate meets the edge that’s only noticeable if you’re stroking your finger across it

The deck of the laptop is a bit spongey when pressed hard, but it doesn’t affect the feeling or typing experience of the keyboard

The trackpad moves a little before a click is registered

There’s a small LED next to the left USB-C port that shows you when the laptop is charging

USB-C power adapter isn’t much bigger than some of Huawei’s smartphone chargers making it easy to carry around

Price

The Huawei MateBook X comes in gray with a Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for $1,099.99 (£851) and gold with a Core i7 processor, 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for $1,299.99 (£1,005). Both models are available for pre-order in the US with UK availability still to be confirmed.

For comparison, Microsoft’s Surface Laptop starts at £979, Dell’s XPS 13 starts at £1,149 and Apple’s MacBook Pro starts at £1,249.

Verdict

The Huawei MateBook X is one of the best Windows 10 ultrabooks available. It’s thin, light, has a great screen, great speakers, good keyboard, solid trackpad, brilliant fingerprint sensor and gets all the basics right. It’s also fanless despite having a full, U-series Core i5 or i7 processor, making it completely silent but with full laptop power.

Some might bemoan the lack of ports with only two USB-C ports and no Thunderbolt, but the included adapter helps ease the transition. The lack of a touchscreen is slightly disappointing, while a TPM is a must if you value your data at all and want to easily encrypt it.

Overall the MateBook X is quite a special little machine, pushing the boundaries of what a super-slender, fanless machine can be.

Pros: thin, light, good keyboard, great screen, good trackpad, excellent fingerprint scanner, USB-C, fanless design, U-series Core i5/i7 processor Cons: no USB-A ports, no touchscreen, can only charge on one side, trackpad has a bit of play, some models do not have a TPM, no 16GB of RAM option

It’s the best, lightest, most beautiful laptop around. Until it runs out of battery. Or you forget a dongle. Or you realise you’re bankrupt

Apple’s latest laptop, the new 13in MacBook Pro, is a much anticipated re-design of the company’s notebook range and represents a brave new USB-C-only future. But is it worth sacrificing ports and spending the best part of £2,000 to use?



The last update to the MacBook Pro that was more than simply a spec-bump was in 2012 with the addition of a high-resolution “Retina” screen. Four years on, powerful notebooks with high-resolution screens that can last all day on a single charge are commonplace in the premium market. The competition has never been more fierce.

Thinner, lighter and now in dark grey

The new MacBook Pro is thinner and lighter than the old one – like almost every tech product every year. It’s also smaller in almost every meaningful way. Even the screen is thinner, and the light-up Apple logo on the lid is no more.

The trackpad has grown considerably, taking up a sizeable proportion of the laptop’s wrist rest In fact it’s so big you will have a tough time not touching it with the heels of your hands when you type, but thankfully Apple’s touch rejection works as advertised.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest The trackpad is ginormous and great. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian

It’s also 3D Touch or Force Touch, whatever you want to call pressure-sensitive, enabled. It means it doesn’t move. I don’t miss the motion, the Taptic Engine underneath is great. The only thing I routinely use a harder click for, though, is to look up words in the dictionary, although a three-finger tap does that too.

The screen is beautiful. Vibrant, crisp, clear and bright: it’s everything you would expect from a £1,749 computer and is a big part of what makes it good to use. The 13in MacBook Pro is about as beautiful as a regular laptop can be.

Touch Bar

Facebook Twitter Pinterest The emoji button, right next to the send mail button ready to dispatch your latest missive in Mac Mail. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian

The biggest visible change is just above the keyboard. The fabled Touch Bar, which replaces the standard function key row with an OLED, touch-sensitive screen. The idea is that it gives you dynamic buttons and sliders to control various aspects of your computing workflow dependent on which app you have open.

By default and without any apps in focus, the Touch Bar displays an escape key and a row of four icons on the right with an arrow expander to show more of the traditional quick settings keys. It’s reminiscent of the Windows task bar.

Holding the Fn key will show the traditional function keys, but can also be set to expand the control keys. Alternatively they can be left expanded like a traditional control row all the time, but that limits what else can be displayed on it.

When using a particular program, it’s up to that program which functions are placed on the Touch Bar. Most provide formatting tools such as bold, italics, underline, justify and list tools. There’s the emoji button that does what you may expect in text boxes, plus there’s the same auto-complete suggestions you might get on an iPhone, although stopping typing to tap on them is most definitely slower for anyone who types at a reasonable speed.

Almost all of Apple’s apps have Touch Bar support, and most buttons and functions can be customised. I liked having the send mail button in Mac Mail on the very left, plus a trash rather than archive button. Third-party imaging program Pixelmator is a great example of what can be done with the bar: you can select various tools straight from it, then change the size of them and other aspects. With a bit of practice you can do most things with one hand on the Touch Bar and one on the trackpad.

Those who use the function or control keys a lot will find the Touch Bar slows them down a bit, myself included. Those who touch type will find it more difficult to use as it’s slower to look down at the keyboard and hit a button rather than just bash out a keyboard shortcut. But for those buttons that you would normally mouse over to – in my case the send email button – having it just above the keyboard is faster and more convenient, although not as convenient as a touchscreen.

Touch ID

Facebook Twitter Pinterest The power button in the top right hand corner of the keyboard is now a fingerprint scanner too. Photograph: The Guardian

The power button on the end of the Touch Bar is a Touch ID fingerprint scanner. I found it a bit of a mixed bag. When it works it works just as well as it does on an iPhone 6S, though not as well as on the 7. The problem is that I found it a bit inconsistent. Not knowing when and where you can and can’t use it means its usually faster just to type a password.

Changing a setting, for instance, I normally had to enter my password, but sometimes I could use my fingerprint. When firing up the computer from cold I had to enter my password, but if resuming from standby I could use my fingerprint, unless the battery got too low, or I left it for too long, then it needs my password. You can buy apps with it, and other bits and pieces. Apple Pay works like it does on an iPad, but only in Safari.

You can also only register three fingerprints, which seems like a step backwards from the five you can register on an iPhone.

Fingerprint scanners on a smartphone were such a massive leap forward for usability, I presumed the same would be for laptops, but it wasn’t the case. I certainly don’t lock and unlock a laptop as much as a phone, so maybe my expectations were too high.

The keyboard

Facebook Twitter Pinterest The MacBook Pro logo is now back on the screen’s bezel. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian

A lot has been said of Apple’s practically-no-travel keyboards. What you make of them will depend on your typing style. I write a lot, and I type quite lightly. I found there was enough feedback for accurate and fast touch typing, but it made a surprising amount of noise. It’s a different noise to a mechanical keyboard, but it’s definitely in that range, particularly when I was really going for it.

If you give the keys some welly when you type, if you’re used to the travel of a good mechanical keyboard for instance, then you may hate the keyboard. If you’re seriously considering buying one, get down to a shop and try it out for at least five minutes.

General computing power

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Image editing in Pixelmator was a breeze on the machine. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian

The 13in MacBook Pro has a choice of dual-core versions of Intel’s sixth-generation Core i5 or i7 processors. They’re not the latest – that would be the seventh generation – but are entirely capable. The cheapest machine (as tested) has 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM and a 2.9GHz Core i5 processor and is not a power-house by modern standards.

It handled the work I put it through admirably - writing, processing and manipulating photos, creating small snippets of video, gifs and doing the odd bit of number crunching.

With enough tabs open in Chrome, running Evernote, Mac Mail and various other bits and pieces, I did hit the 8GB RAM cap though. As with previous Flash-based Macs, Apple’s use of a speedy page file means you might not notice until you get an occasional sluggish page load or a short delay when jumping between apps. For longevity, 16GB of RAM is worth buying for most people, given it’s soldered on and you can’t change it later.

For the general consumer, the 13in MacBook Pro is more than capable of getting the job done, but given it has “Pro” in the name, perhaps that isn’t enough. Attempting to edit small documentary-length 4K video is likely to a bit of a chore on it, particularly if you do not use Apple’s video editing suite, but then I’m not sure many who buy a 13in laptop are likely to be attempting to do so.

It’s worth noting that the massive jumps in processing performance every 12 months or so that was possible five to 10 years ago have more or less faded into distant memory, replaced instead by incremental gains and reduced power consumption in computers.

Where are all the ports?

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Two USB-C ports and a headphones socket on the right-hand side. Photograph: The Guardian

Apple has decided that USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 are the future, which means apart from a headphones/mic socket, all you get are four USB-C ports. There’s no card reader, no traditional USB, no ethernet or mini DisplayPort. USB-C is even used for power, which means any of the four ports can be used to charge the MacBook Pro.

It might be the future, but right now it’s a dongle-ridden faff. How much it’s a problem depends on what you normally plug into your machine. Many things are cable agnostic – just buy a USB-C to USB-A cable to connect your printer, if you still have one.

But many are not and the lack of even just one USB-A port is irritating. I ended up carrying an extra six different cables and adapters just to continue as I was, adding another step to most peripheral action.

The funny thing is that many Android smartphones ship with USB-C to USB-C cables, meaning they can be plugged straight into the MacBook Pro no problem, but Apple’s own iPhone requires either a dongle or USB-C to Lightning cable to be bought.

Five-to-six hour battery

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Plug in the power either side with two more USB-C sockets on the left-hand side. Photograph: The Guardian

Lack of ports is something you can get used to. Lack of battery life is not.

Apple claims that the 13in MacBook Pro will last for 10 hours under its testing conditions. I didn’t get anywhere close to that figure. Barely using it for more than emailing and browsing with a few tabs open in Chrome, the brightness set at about 75%, Evernote and Twitter open and Double Shot preventing it from sleeping, I managed just over six hours on battery. Swapping Chrome out for Safari increased battery life for some sites, but I noticed others really chewed through battery, meaning it came out about even.

A good working day with about 10 tabs open in Chrome, as well as Typora for text, Wire for chat, Mac Mail for email, Twitter and Pixelmator open intermittently for image editing when required, I got just over five hours. I’m not sure that could be counted as really pushing the machine either.

If it was the 15in MacBook Pro I could almost imagine that you’d never use it when away from power, and that battery life wasn’t that important. But a 13in laptop is made for portability. Thankfully charging it from dead while under full working conditions only took one hour 40 minutes, and less if I wasn’t actively using it.

Observations

I wish you could permanently place a single F key on the Touch Bar, but you can’t

Touch ID seems slower than on an iPhone 7

Below 5% battery the computer becomes incredibly sluggish

Being able to plug in power either side is great

The speakers are louder and sound better than old MacBook Pros, but still not quite room filling

The USB-C ports are too close together to put anything wider into them meaning USB-C to USB-A adapters have to have a decent cord length to attach them next to anything else

I kept touching the Touch Bar accidentally when resting my hands on the keyboard

Changing the volume or brightness is now a two-stage tap and tap or tap and drag affair

Price

The 13in MacBook Pro with Touch Bar starts at £1,749 and reaches £2,759 with optional upgrades.

For comparison, Dell’s XPS 13 with a compatible screen starts at £1,129, Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 with an Intel Core i5 starts at £849 and the Surface Book starts at £1,299.

Verdict

The 13in MacBook Pro could be a wonderful computer, but it isn’t. Is it great to use? Absolutely, it’s brilliant, it’s beautiful, it’s almost everything Apple said it was, I absolutely love it … until it runs out of battery. Or you have to dig out yet another dongle to use a sodding USB flash drive, or a card reader, or attach a display. Or you realise that you spent a month’s mortgage money on a computer and are having your house repossessed.

And that is the 13in MacBook Pro’s biggest flaw. It is very expensive for what it is. It hasn’t got the latest processors or graphics, it has limits on the amount of RAM you can pay to shove in it and you can’t change anything after you’ve bought it. That’s not such a problem for a general computer, but a minimum of £1,749 for a general computer, even a post-Brexit referendum Apple computer, is a lot of money.

So then it’s “for the Pros”, who justify spending large sums of money on working machines. But it’s not capable of getting through a journalist’s day on battery, let alone anyone who does anything more intensive than browse the internet, write in a basic text editor and edit the odd photo. It’ll saddle you with iPhone 7 syndrome – constantly in search of a power supply or chaining you to using it as a small desktop surrogate.

Perhaps all-day battery life shouldn’t be a thing we expect, but previous Apple computers could do just that and more.

And there’s the question of power. For almost two grand you’d expect a machine to last four to five years. For a demanding user who must have a “Pro” the RAM cap of 16GB isn’t going to cut it in two years time, which again, wouldn’t be a problem if the machine cost £1,000 not £2,000.

So, then, the 13in MacBook Pro is the best computer you shouldn’t buy.

Pros: beautiful, great screen, interesting Touch Bar, Touch ID, massive trackpad, thin and relatively light, USB-C Cons: short battery life, no USB-A ports, no ethernet, no native display ports, no upgrading after purchase, very expensive

Here is this week’s playlist – songs picked by a reader from your suggestions after last week’s callout. Thanks for taking part. Read more about how our weekly series works at the end of the piece.

Beginning our list – by popular request – is I’m the Man by Joe Jackson. Among many other crazes mentioned in this 1979 tune, Jackson claims to have given us the Hula Hoop. (Although I beg to differ – there’s evidence that kids were hooping in 14th-century England.)

The plan for the rest of this playlist was to have no plan and just pick the songs I liked, but gradually a trend began to emerge, not only in the fads and crazes themselves, but in the negativity that many of these tracks stirred up.



For instance, I chose Willie & the Hand Jive by Johnny Otis because I’m a sucker for the Bo Diddley beat. At the time of its release in the late 1950s, rock’n’roll venues in England did not permit standing or dancing in the aisles, so instead they danced in their seats. At Otis’s concerts, the audience would be shown Willie’s hand jive dance so they could join in. Despite the song’s references to dancing, and despite the demonstrations of the dance during performances, would-be censors believed that the song glorified masturbation. I wonder why? Slightly less controversial, though still upsetting the prudish, is Hot Pants by James Brown. The garment went from homely Daisy Dukes to the sleaze of the adult entertainment industry as portrayed by Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver.

No such problems with our next number – Do the Strand by Roxy Music, which references a new dance (“There’s a new sensation / A fabulous creation”) but gives no instructions on how to do it – typical art school antics.

Brand New Key by Melanie is an innocent song about her memories of rollerskating when she was young, but that didn’t stop the Freudians from jumping on the lock and key elements of the song as being somehow symbolically sexual. It even led to the song being banned on radio.

The steps to our next dance need very little instruction. Stiff torso, rigid arms, legs together, jump. As Pogo Dancing by the Vibrators puts it, “Why move from side to side / When you can jump up and down?” Sid Vicious claimed to have invented the dance, backed up by Viv Albertine and Shane McGowan, who said that a leather poncho Sid wore to gigs prevented him from any form of dancing other than jumping up and down. Which brings us neatly to the Svengali of punk, whose magpie instincts led to Double Dutch by Malcolm McLaren – a song about the international skipping game based on a South African tune. Lawsuits ensued when Township jive group the Boyoyo Boys took legal action against McLaren over the similarity of Double Dutch to one of their own songs. Barristers were engaged before the matter was settled in favour of the band.

In Zoot Suit by the High Numbers, when Daltrey sings, “I wear zoot suit jacket with side vents five inches long / I have two-tone brogues yeah you know this is wrong”, it’s all about one-upmanship and style, but in Los Angeles during the second world war they were the cause of a series of what became known as the Zoot Suit riots. The suits were very popular with the Mexican-American youth, but because of the large amounts of fabric they used in a time of rationing, they were deemed unpatriotic, leading to attacks from white American servicemen.

Since the late 60s the ultimate aim for hippies has been a visit to Goa. Ain’t Going to Goa by Alabama 3 is having none of it. They ain’t trance dancin’ or chanting tantric mantra. They get all the consciousness they need at their local tabernacle.

The Beats were the antithesis of American culture in their time and were consequently stereotyped as criminal delinquents, among other things. The Beat Generation by Louis Armstrong is the theme song for a film of the same name – a sensationalist flick about a bad beatnik. Louis sings: “Now your lives don’t have a meaning though you’re living up a storm / You’ll do anything at all except conform”. Lifelong pot smoker Louis must have been laughing inside when he sang that.

Gimmix! (Play Loud) by John Cooper Clarke has the Bard of Salford observing consumerism: “Another day – another fad”, riffing off everything from a “skateboard panic” to “cushions that fart”.

Why Do You Bob Your Hair, Girls? by J.E. Mainer is a gentle lampooning of the religious criticism directed at the 1920s hairstyle. And finally, we have Pattern Recognition by Sonic Youth, inspired by the book written by one of my favourite authors, William Gibson, with a maverick trendspotter as its central heroine.

Not all songs appear on the Spotify playlist as some are unavailable on the service.

If you’re taking part in this year’s G20 protests, we’d like you to tell us why

Thousands of protesters are expected to disrupt the G20 summit this week to voice their grievances against the annual meeting of world leaders – which, this year, includes Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

Police say they expect 5,000 protesters to take part in a “Welcome to Hell” march as delegates arrive in Hamburg airport on Thursday afternoon. A “G20 not welcome” march on Saturday is expected to attract up to 100,000 members of anti-fascist, feminist and climate activist groups. A separate march, “Hamburg Shows Attitude”, has been organised by a collection of non-profit organisations.

Police say they have seized knives and containers – presumed to be filled with flammable liquid – from locations in and around the city, amid fears that the protests could turn violent.

If you’re taking part in protests at the G20 summit, we’d like you to tell us why.

You can fill in the form below and we’ll use a selection of responses in our reporting. We will keep your information as secure as possible.

Police chief predicts ‘not just sit-in protests but massive assaults’ as Germany’s second largest city prepares for summit starting on Friday

Hamburg is bracing itself for an escalation of violence on the eve of Friday and Saturday’s G20 summit, after local people complained that heavy-handed police have ratcheted up tensions in Germany’s second largest city.

A fleet of hi-tech water cannons was used to disperse crowds partying near the conference venue on Tuesday evening. Five people were injured and five arrests made, said police, who have warned that protesters could be hoarding weapons at secret locations.

Authorities in Germany’s second-largest city are preparing for the arrival of an unprecedented lineup of controversial world leaders including Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, as well as thousands of international protesters ranging from anti-capitalist activists to middle-class families keen to voice dissent.

Police say they expect a core of about 5,000 violent protesters to gather in the city’s historic port area for a “Welcome to Hell” march just as world leaders and international delegates start arriving at Hamburg airport on Thursday afternoon.

The Hamburg police chief, Ralf Martin Meyer, expressed concerns that the city would see “not just sit-in protests but massive assaults”, as anarchists from Scandinavia, Switzerland and Italy joined up with local activists in a city with a long tradition of leftwing protest and annual May Day riots.

In the run-up to the summit, German police have seized knives, baseball bats and containers presumed to be filled with flammable liquid and unknown chemicals from various locations in and around Hamburg. Jan Hieber, a senior officer, said police had probably only found a small proportion of the weapons that had been stockpiled for use in the protests.

“There is evidence that the acts of violence around the G20 summit that we had expected and feared will take place,” said Meyer. The interior minister, Thomas de Maizière, announced on Tuesday that 15,000 police would be on duty at the summit.

A note by the German defence ministry leaked to Der Spiegel advises soldiers against wearing their uniforms in public during the summit for fear of becoming targeted by “spontaneous attacks by members of violent-prone participants of leftwing extremist protests”.

The leaked document also mentions plans to “disrupt the summit’s procedure, occupy all access routes and logistics hubs, attack urban infrastructure and blockade the harbour”.

Many local residents complain, however, that heavy-handed policing against peaceful protesters has helped ratchet up tensions in the run-up the G20 meeting on 7 and 8 July. At 11pm on Tuesday, Hamburg police used a new fleet of “WaWe10” water cannons to clear an area between the Schanzenviertel district and FC St Pauli’s football stadium, where hundreds had gathered to drink alcohol and listen to music.

“Cornering”, supposedly inspired by breakdance crews hanging out on street corners in 1980s New York, has been purposefully adopted as a form of “hedonistic protest” by Hamburg activists in recent weeks. Similar forms of protests, including a public rave in the harbour on Wednesday evening, are planned throughout the summit.

The German newspaper Taz described Tuesday’s show of strength in the midst of a peaceful protest as a “professional escalation” on behalf of the police, which would have caused howls of outrage had similar incidents taken place in Russia or Turkey.

Hamburg’s police union had warned that it would not pursue a strategy of deescalation unless activists scaled down their rhetoric. “A strategy of deescalation can only work when both sides want and allow it,” said Oliver Malchow, of Germany’s police union GdP.

“We want that for all 30 registered demonstrations. But in the face of the rhetoric of leftwing activists and names like ‘Welcome to Hell’ we have to presume a high potential for violence. In that case deescalation would be inappropriate,” he said.

The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has appealed to protesters to express their dissent in a peaceful manner, warning that “those who turn to violence mock democracy”.



In an interview with weekly Die Zeit, Merkel defended the controversial decision to hold the G20 summit in Hamburg, arguing that the scale of the event and the expected number of visitors had required the infrastructure of a large city.

Merkel, who will meet Trump for a 45-minute bilateral meeting on Thursday night followed by a joint dinner with Asian delegates, said getting world leaders around the same table for a conversation was “a value in itself” at a time when changing power structures were causing “speechlessness”.

Protesters plan to take advantage of the decision to hold this week’s G20 summit in a crowded inner-city area of Hamburg and copy police crowd control tactics to “kettle Trump, Putin and Erdoğan”.

Authorities in Germany’s second-largest city are preparing for the arrival of an unprecedented line-up of controversial world leaders, as well as protest groups eager to voice dissent on 7 and 8 July.

Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin will meet at the summit, and Germany will try to push climate change and free trade to the top of the agenda.

The chancellor, Angela Merkel, has argued that her birthplace, a wealthy port city and a “beacon of free trade”, was “almost predestined” to host the gathering of the world’s leading industrialised and developing economies.

But the decision to hold it at a congress centre in a densely populated part of the inner city, bordering a district with a long-running history of anti-establishment protests and annual May Day riots, has put police services on high alert.

On Sunday night, the first of a series of protest marches culminated in clashes with police over a disputed campsite in one of the city’s park areas. Several people were reportedly injured and one person was arrested.

Jan Reinicke, of the Association of Criminal Police, told the Guardian: “Many of my colleagues and I find it incomprehensible that another big city has been chosen for such a gathering after the terrible events of Genoa. Why Hamburg when you could have held the G20 in, say, a forest in Bavaria or on Heligoland?”

The 2001 G8 summit in the Italian port city was overshadowed by clashes between police and an estimated 200,000 demonstrators, and the death of a 23-year-old Italian anti-globalisation protester, Carlo Giuliani.

Hamburg authorities have said they expect about half the numbers of protesters that descended on Genoa in 2001, but the presence of divisive political figures such as Trump and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, is likely to draw protesters from a wide range of political causes.

A “G20 not welcome” march on Saturday is expected to attract between 50,000 and 100,000 members of anti-fascist, feminist and Kurdish groups, as well as climate activists. A separate protest march, “Hamburg Shows Attitude”, has been organised by a range of cultural and social institutions in the city.

Police have expressed particular concern about Thursday afternoon’s “Welcome to Hell” march, expected to draw up to 8,000 anarchists and leftwing radicals.

The congress centre borders the densely populated Schanzenviertel district on its western and southern edge, and rail tracks prohibit access from the north, meaning delegates will probably only be able to enter the venue from the west.

Faced with a growing number of registered protest marches, police announced an assembly ban within a 38 square kilometre zone stretching from the airport to the conference centre. Protest groups and politicians from the Green party and leftwing Die Linke have tried to appeal against the ban.

Hamburg’s centre-left city senate had previously rejected police proposals for a wholesale ban on demonstrations in the city centre, reportedly because of concerns that German politicians could not be seen to be cracking down on freedom of speech on their own doorstep while decrying its absence in other countries, such as Russia.

“There will be 20 delegations, each of which will need a choice of three secured routes into the centre, in case of emergency changes of plan,” Reinicke said. “The potential risk scenarios are varied and hard to predict. Of course the concern is that the violence in the inner-city areas could escalate and we end up with another Genoa.”

Hamburg police have said they would not tolerate violent behaviour of the kind displayed by Erdoğan’s bodyguards during his recent Washington visit. “On the streets of Hamburg we are the sole authority,” said police president Ralf Martin Meyer. “We would certainly take action against something like this, including taking people into detention if they lash out against third parties.”

Protest organisers aim to take advantage of the urban setting by finding creative ways to block access in and out of the summit venue. Under the “Block G20” banner, demonstrators plan to host table tennis tournaments, outdoor cinema screenings and street raves on the main arteries leading in and out of the complex. A “Colourful Mass” bike ride is also intended to obstruct traffic.

“Protesters are used to being kettled [a police tactic used to contain crowds during demonstrations],” said Emily Laquer, a spokesperson for the march being held on Saturday. “At the G20, we’re going to turn the tables on Trump, Putin and Erdoğan.”

Hamburg’s interior senator, Andy Grote, a member of the Social Democratic party, has said protesters could risk their lives if they got in the way of a motorcade carrying a head of state. “Security forces will see every hold-up as a major emergency, even if it’s just because of a harmless demonstration. They won’t stop under any circumstances,” he said.

Organisers behind the Block G20 protests have dismissed such concerns as scaremongering, arguing that their activities will not directly target politicians but aim to disrupt the proceedings of the summit.

“Trump and co should be able to be helicoptered into the conference centre either way,” said Nico Berg, a spokesperson for Block G20. “But we will make sure that his sherpas with the paperwork, the press entourage and the lunchtime catering won’t be able to join them there.”

Activist Peter Tatchell is calling for Pride in London to lose some of the rules and bureaucracy that have lessened its impact. What do you think?

On Saturday tens of thousands will take to the streets for the Pride in London parade, marching, watching from the sidelines and generally revelling in celebration and solidarity.



I’ve marched in every Pride London since 1972. Today, it needs liberating | Peter Tatchell Read more

Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell writes in the Guardian today that “what began in 1972 as a protest for gay rights has now morphed into a commercialised, bureaucratic and rule-bound event, which too often reflects the wishes of the city authorities, not the LGBT community.”

He is concerned that in many ways the ideals of LGBT equality have been eroded by PR opportunities for big brands – and worries this is happening in London more so than in, say, São Paulo, where up to 3 million take to the streets.

Andy Forbes says the evidence supports the borough’s planned regeneration; Martin Ball believes there is something rotten at the heart of the local council; Mary Langan says the area’s provision for older people has been decimated; Douglas Robertson says Friedrich Engels witnessed the same social cleansing

Chairman Mao famously said “all power comes out of the barrel of a gun”. A bit blunt, perhaps, but essentially true. Power, no matter how politely dressed up or how well disguised by justifications and rationalisations, is essentially about forcing others to do what you want. Power bullies, power pushes opposition aside. In modern societies, as the great Italian communist Antonio Gramsci argued, governments try hard to get their way through consent – by getting the majority to agree with their viewpoint. But in the end, consent is all too often backed up by coercion. The baton and the bullet usually trump the ballot box.

So for me it’s strange to read a recent article about housing policy in the part of London in which I work, by Aditya Chakrabortty, with the headline “How power operates in modern Britain: with absolute contempt” (3 July). Because that’s how power has always operated, ancient and modern, in Britain and everywhere else. Often, it has to be said, without even a semblance of the sort of democratic accountability and openness to public challenge we have in the UK today.

But of course Aditya Chakrabortty knows this. His words are in fact an attempt to challenge the ideological consensus on which current housing policy is based. He is holding the proponents of public-private partnerships in contempt, castigating them for being immoral, callous and wrong. He is engaging in the power struggle. Mobilising a political counter-attack on the bastions of the establishment. Words are, after all, power.

If he’s going to win he’ll have to persuade me and others of three things which fly against the weight of historical evidence. First, that putting things in public ownership is better than putting them in private ownership, particularly social goods like housing. For anybody familiar with the sprawling council estates of the postwar era this is far from obvious. Council-owned housing was badly built, badly maintained, and created zones of antisocial behaviour and community despair.

Second, that the people who live on the estates due for renewal are happy with their current conditions and don’t want change. Many of them are in fact desperate for better designed and managed estates, and don’t care if the landlord is public or private as long as the service is responsive and good and caring.

Third, that the voters in local councils who for years have repeatedly elected and re-elected the councillors – whom Chakrabortty criticises so resoundingly as “zombie Blairites” – are showing contempt by trying to come up with new solutions to old problems. Maybe the council’s leaders are wrong, but are they contemptuous of their own supporters? That’s quite a claim.

Perhaps Aditya Chakrabortty is unaware that he’s involved in a power struggle, and genuinely believes he stands above the political fray. But I doubt it. I suspect he knows very well what he’s doing and has for some reason decided not to use reasoned argument to make his point. Instead he is exercising the zeal that true believers always show when faced with those they consider heretics. “The power of Christ compels you!” the exorcists of old used to cry when faced with imagined devils.

Maybe now, for those like Aditya Chakrabortty, it is the power of Corbyn being invoked, I don’t know. But I’m afraid I find that just as scary. No reasoning. Just power.

• David Lammy and Catherine West (MPs move on sell-off, 4 July) fail to mention one fundamental reason for residents’ anger at the Haringey council proposal to establish a 50-50 company with Lendlease: the related issue of the process followed by the council and the behaviour of those making the decision.

Not until now have residents been able to access substantial council information about the proposal. And even those 1,500 pages of information were only released the required five days before the meeting deciding whether to approve the policy. As a PDF. The council claims the full details are confidential, and so the extent of the deal that affects the futures of thousands of people is a secret to a small band of councillors and officials. How can residents hold the council leadership to account, given this imbalance of information?

Even if there was a level playing field, there is unease about the behaviour of the councillors and officials advocating the deal. Haringey council has taken sponsorship funding to send senior councillors and regeneration officials to the annual Mipim gathering in Cannes. Councillors have separately taken extensive hospitality from developers and their PR consultants. While this is all declared, in my view the behaviour of these councillors and officials is below the standards of probity that should be expected of public office holders.

There is something rotten at the heart of Haringey council democracy, and the proposed deal with Lendlease is the latest sign of a sick politics. Residents are disadvantaged in participating in decisions about their homes and businesses, and are cynical about the access developers have bought with their sponsorship and hospitality.

Martin Ball

London

• Aditya Chakrabortty accurately identifies the contempt for tenants that underlies Haringey council’s decision to sell off a substantial chunk of its housing stock, together with schools and libraries, to a private property developer. The same lack of respect is also evident in its recent decision to close down Osborne Grove, the council’s sole remaining nursing home for the frail elderly.

Over the past five years, Haringey’s adult social care department has abandoned virtually all its residential care facilities and day centres for vulnerable adults. When they announced the most recent wave of closures in December 2015, council leaders promised to retain and develop Osborne Grove as a specialist reablement centre. In December a Care Quality Commission inspection found that standards at the home fell below minimum requirements in relation to management, nutrition and basic nursing care. A further review in March found that standards had fallen still further, prompting the council’s brisk decision to opt for closure.

It is clear that, far from delivering a flagship rehabilitation service, Haringey’s department of adult social care cannot deliver even routine nursing care at Osborne Grove. Having already closed services for dementia at the Grange, and for the frail elderly at the Haynes, Haringey will shortly have no provision whatsoever to offer its senior citizens.

Council tenants face the prospect of being forced to move out of their homes and being rehoused in some distant tower block. If they manage to stay in Haringey, now they should also fear growing old and infirm.

• Aditya Chakrabortty’s excellent article reveals that the power driving housing is finance and profit, with London being the most extreme contemporary illustration. The Grenfell slaughter – for that is what it was – has helped shed a little light on to the social cleansing that underpins London’s “regeneration” practice. And the Labour party is as guilty in this practice as the Conservatives, as Haringey ably illustrates.

But this is hardly new. Remember that London, until the late 1950s, consisted largely of rented houses and flats. Property had long been owned by the landed gentry, and later by the emergent capitalist class.

Then in the “swinging 60s” came refinancing via ready access to mortgage finance and a form of tenure called leasehold, a feudal legal variant of renting. This brought in its wake the mass “winkling out” of the city’s poor, giving birth to “gentrification” and the various property bubbles that now dominate popular understandings of London, ably articulated through Kirstie Allsopp and Phil Spencer’s Location, Location, Location.

Thus we have long witnessed, and some of us have been party to, the social cleansing of the poor who once resided in property located on valuable land. Friedrich Engels wrote about similar processes occurring in Manchester in the 1840s, although then the land inhabited by the poor was desired by railroads, not homeowners or buy-to-let landlords. Financiers were, however, core to both cleansings.

So none of this is new. Power operates in modern Britain as it did in the past, to the benefit of the rich and powerful, at the expense of the weak and powerless. The financial tools and particular focus may change, but the outcomes are all too familiar to those that choose to see.

On the 18 July 1817, Jane Austen died in Winchester, after a long, painful illness. Her brother James arranged for her to be buried in the cathedral. The inscription on her tomb reads:

In Memory of JANE AUSTEN, youngest daughter of the late Revd GEORGE AUSTEN, formerly Rector of Steventon in this County. She departed this Life on the 18th of July 1817, aged 41, after a long illness supported with the patience and the hopes of a Christian. The benevolence of her heart, the sweetness of her temper, and the extraordinary endowments of her mind obtained the regard of all who knew her and the warmest love of her intimate connections. Their grief is in proportion to their affection, they know their loss to be irreparable, but in their deepest affliction they are consoled by a firm though humble hope that her charity, devotion, faith and purity have rendered her soul acceptable in the sight of her REDEEMER.

Touching words – and perhaps it is unusual for a woman of Austen’s time to be complimented for the “endowments of her mind”. But viewed from the 21st century, there is a glaring omission. Why did James fail to mention that his sister was one of the greatest damn writers who has ever lived?

Yes, he had no way of knowing that she would be remembered hundreds of years later for helping invent the English novel and as one of the finest observers of the human heart and social customs. But why did he not think it was worth mentioning that Austen was an exquisite prose stylist? Surely he could have mentioned her way with zingers? Just look at them: “For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn?” Or this: “Nobody minds having what is too good for them.” Or: “It was a delightful visit;– perfect, in being much too short.”

I could happily spend this whole article rooting out Jane Austen quotes, but the chances are you’ve read them all. She is central to our culture – so much so, you might think it will be a challenge to find something new to discuss this month on the Reading group. What hasn’t already been said about Austen?

But I’m not worried. Like all great authors, Austen holds a mirror up to our times as much as to her own. She’s always relevant, but also very much of her time. Reading the famous opening lines of Pride and Prejudice, who today would still believe “it is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife”? Austen shows that, even in 1813, things were a little more complicated than that exquisite phrasing suggests, but it is fascinating to read of such a society from a completely different vantage point.

Speaking of the passing of time, I’m also curious to see how it feels to read Austen again. It’s more than 20 years since I read anything she wrote. Some time in the mid-90s I ground out my last A-level paragraph about dramatic irony in Emma, put away my pen with relief, started reading On the Road – and didn’t look back. I suspect there are plenty of other people in a similar situation, so it will be fascinating to engage with her again (especially free from the shadow of exams). I’m hoping to discover all sorts of new things in her books, and I might even catch a few jokes that were too subtle for me when I was 18.

In short, I’m looking forward to it. The only question is which book to read. I think the simplest and best way to decide will be to put all of her novels to a vote. They are (in order of publication):

Sense and Sensibility

Pride and Prejudice

Mansfield Park

Emma

Northanger Abbey

Persuasion

Lady Susan

Lady Susan was a short epistolary novel written while Austen was a teenager, but published in 1871. If it rouses your curiosity, I don’t see why we can’t count it in. Otherwise, there are six classics to choose from. Nominate your favourite in the comments below and I’ll return here in a few days time to tot up the results.

Until then, one more classic quote from Austen, which I include without comment: “The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel must be intolerably stupid.”

During Sony’s decade-long cultivation of Spider-Man on the big screen, the studio only found a single method of introducing the webslinger – via the traditional origins story, in which Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider and earns to use his new powers for the greater good. Fortunately for audiences, Marvel plumped for a fresh approach with the character’s debut in last year’s Captain America: Civil War. Now comes the superhero’s first movie proper, and according to the critics it is the best episode since 2004’s Spider-Man 2, with an impressive 93% “fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

Spider-Man: Homecoming review – web-slinging wit powers razor-sharp reboot Read more

Tom Holland’s Spider-Man

His big-screen predecessors both had their moments, but Holland just might be the most likable Spidey so far. Tobey Maguire’s version often seemed rather self-obsessed, while Andrew Garfield’s was a bit too much of a punky alpha male. By contrast, Holland’s real superpower is his youthful enthusiasm: this is a hilariously green 15-year-old whose one-sided banter with Robert Downey Jr’s Tony Stark charmingly exposes the extent to which he is out of his depth.

Despite spending most of the film scrambling to stay alive, Holland is not short on heroism. Unlike Maguire in Spider-Man 2, there’s never any question of him giving up his role as a superhero. By the time the end credits roll, he has even turned down the chance to join the Avengers, in order to focus on keeping New York City safe. There is no need for Uncle Ben’s reminder that “with great power comes great responsibility” – Holland’s Parker is already way ahead of the game.

The breezy tone

The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has been drifting into a new heart of darkness since bitter infighting between former Avengers in Civil War. However, Homecoming reminds us that the Marvel films were once seen as the breezy antidote to Christopher Nolan’s brooding Batman movies. Downey Jr hasn’t had this much fun since the first Iron Man flick, and while previous Avengers movies have touched upon Cap’s amusingly old-school prudishness, it took a film in which Chris Evans only appears in cameo to remind us of the comedy potential inherent in the patriotic superhero’s squeaky clean image.

Homecoming also benefited from an absence of CGI mega-carnage, thanks to a human villain with down-to-earth, localised motivations. Not every Marvel film can end with a major American metropolis being blasted to smithereens, and this episode has the necessary lighter touch to distract us from the bigger picture being presented in The Avengers films.

The impressive embedding in the MCU

Rather than getting bogged down in world-building, Watts and his team smartly turn the rigid mechanics of working within the Marvel universe to their advantage. Both Homecoming’s hero and villain effectively get new origins stories that seem entirely naturalistic, especially when compared to the well-worn radioactive spider-bite and death-of-Uncle-Ben segues used to introduce the masked wallcrawler in previous versions.

Spidey’s introduction takes its cue from his appearance in last-year’s Captain America: Civil War, which lit up that bleakly intense entry like a streak of Asgardian lightning against the darkening heavens. Revisiting it, via Peter Parker’s enthusiastically thrown-together home movie, turns out to be the perfect introduction to Homecoming . This is a film all about Spider-Man being forced to come back down to Earth after the initial high of battling with (and against) The Avengers.

Likewise, Michael Keaton’s Adrian Toomes/Vulture is intelligently reconfigured as a creature of the MCU. Toomes is only able to become the winged monstrosity thanks to alien technology discarded by the Chitauri during their invasion of Earth in 2012’s The Avengers. He is motivated to turn evil by antipathy towards Tony Stark/Iron Man, whose post-Chitauri clean-up operation drives the salvage operator out of business. Would you agree that the use of existing themes to embed Spidey in the MCU was ingenious?

Spider-Man and his amazing friends

Another key shift in Homecoming is that Peter Parker no longer feels trapped in the Mary Jane Watson/Harry Osborn love triangle that permeated Sam Raimi’s noughties trilogy. Nor is he tagged as a brooding loner, as in Marc Webb’s Amazing Spider-Man movies. As promised, this really is a high-school movie – we get to see a lot more of Midtown High than in previous instalments – with Parker as confused by the challenges of teen existence as he is by the struggle to assume his superhero duties.

Despite retaining Parker as Spidey at the expense of Miles Morales (a teenager of black Hispanic descent from Brooklyn, who has taken over in the comics following Parker’s death), our hero finally feels as if he’s living in a version of New York that’s recognisable in reality, rather than a whitewashed 1950s throwback. The students at Midtown are from suitably diverse backgrounds, but crucially, there is little in the way of racial stereotyping.

Jacob Batalon’s Ned makes the perfect comedy sidekick – the geeky yet lovable teen best friend – while Laura Harrier’s Liz is a pleasingly offbeat love interest. Zendaya’s Michelle Jones, AKA MJ, also has some amusingly eccentric moments, though only the Marvel marketing team will know why the singer and Disney Channel regular was featured so prominently in advance publicity when her involvement is so minimal.

The twist

It’s rare that a big-budget Hollywood production pulls off a narrative curveball without audiences spotting it a mile off. However, the revelation that Parker’s love interest Liz is also Toomes’ daughter drew audible gasps, then applause and laughter, during the screening I attended. We’ve seen the protective dad scenario a hundred times in teen movies – even Webb’s The Amazing Spider-Man featured a Spidey-baiting George Stacy – but Parker’s tense car journey to the prom in the back seat of his nemesis’s car made Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner look like a cheery picnic with the in-laws. Did you see this one coming, or were you blindsided like the rest of us?

Should the Avengers be nationalised? This is the explosively controversial idea that ignites a “civil war” among their ranks in this exciting superhero extravaganza. It’s crazily surreal, engaging and funny in the best Marvel tradition, building to a whiplash-twist reveal that sports with the ever-present idea of duplicity and betrayal within the Avengers’ ranks themselves.



The innumerable civilian deaths and collateral damage that always follow the Avengers’ spectacular city-pulverising showdowns have become impossible to ignore – and now the Avengers are faced with having to submit to UN political oversight and control.

After a catastrophic Avengers action in Lagos that resulted in Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) inadvertently trashing part of a building and killing innocent people, a political summit in Vienna is convened in which the Avengers must sign away their superheroic independence. It’s an unthinkable humiliation – the superhero equivalent of the Treaty of Versailles. And some of them aren’t having it.

Joss Whedon: 'I was beaten down by making The Avengers: Age of Ultron' Read more

Captain America (Chris Evans) makes a stand for the Avengers’ autonomy. Lining up behind him are the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Scarlet Witch.

But ranged against him, deciding to go along with the new political reality, is Tony Stark, otherwise known as Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), and joining him are War Machine (Don Cheadle), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Vision (Paul Bettany).

But wait. However real these divisive issues are, might they have been deliberately triggered by a sinister German agent, persuasively played by Daniel Brühl, who sets out to exploit the dangerous, destructive potential within Winter Soldier – a dark secret dating back to a 1991 Russian military experiment revealed in flashback?

And just to make things even more lively, and even more confusing, there are two late team entries – Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and also Spider-Man, in which role Tom Holland makes his bow, and they are seductively high-spirited and hilarious, their essential absurdity and gaiety an essential part of the Marvel alchemy that somehow feeds into the Avengers’ intense seriousness and idealism. The final punch-up is of course spectacular, its collisions and detonations greeted with some outrageous one-liners.

So what is the political significance of the Avengers’ civil war? Is Captain America’s team the face of the libertarian right, scorning the dead hand of big government and the nanny state? Are Iron Man’s crew the standard bearers of centrist social democracy? How strange that Captain America, a military man from the FDR era, should scorn hierarchical control. How curious that Tony Stark, that fearless entrepreneur and risk-taker, should submit to bureaucracy. And there is incidentally not much to be gained from analysing the two teams’ identity politics. The gender balance is the same in both cases, although with twice as many African-Americans, Iron Man’s team has the edge in diversity.



No, what is obvious that there really is no real ideological difference between them. Even when they are bashing and thrashing each other – this time in an environment where there will be no collateral damage – what is all too clear is that their profound love and Avenger-y fellowship is undamaged. And no one much cares for the idea of state control and those boring, besuited politicians and functionaries, here played by William Hurt and Martin Freeman.



The best scene comes in the middle where Tony Stark has to recruit Spider-Man – a long, sarcastic chat, in which Stark drolly derides Peter Parker’s arachnid “onesie”. The civil war is not one that anyone expects to be “won” in any permanent sense although the title might lead you to expect that Captain America will emerge as the most important combatant: it is, after all, supposed to be his movie. In fact, Chris Evans’s relative lack of charisma is still a (minor) problem. He gets upstaged by Downey, and almost everyone else. But not by much. It’s a huge aspartame rush of a film: a giant irresistible snack, not nutritious, but very tasty.

Michael Gove says that if people who get degrees go on to earn well, they should pay something back (Report, 3 July). My daughter is almost 30, in her first postdoctoral job, earning real money at last. When she went to university she took out loans for fees only – we paid her rent, and she worked evenings and weekends to live. She then was on a scholarship through her master’s and PhD. She had a year out through illness, when she could claim nothing and lived on her credit card and overdraft. Finally she is a woman in science doing research into Zika and other viruses. She is earning enough to start paying back her loan and is happy to do so. But her monthly repayment only scrapes the surface of the capital debt. It is mostly paying the interest accrued over all those years of intense study. And that is a disgrace.

Janet Moore

Harleston, Norfolk

• Graduates already do pay back. First, by paying back their loans with interest. Second, by paying taxes, at higher rates if they earn well. Third, and most importantly, by their enormous contributions to the wellbeing of all in this country through their cultural, intellectual, financial and scientific skills and by their outstanding achievements in such professions as law, teaching, healthcare etc. Educating our young people in HEIs is an investment that pays off more obviously and significantly than the machinations of our ruling political classes.

Environment secretary says it is fair for graduates to ‘pay something back’, after Damian Green’s call for debate on issue

Michael Gove has launched a robust defence of university tuition fees, saying graduates should “pay something back”, after Theresa May’s close ally Damian Green called for a debate about the issue.

Gove, who was brought back into the cabinet as environment secretary in the modest post-election reshuffle, said placing the burden on graduates was the fairest way of ensuring universities were properly resourced.

“If we have to fund higher education, and if people who get university degrees go on to earn well, they should pay something back, which is what the current system does,” he said. “It’s wrong if people who don’t go to university find that they have to pay more in taxation to support those who do.”

A proposal to abolish the charge of up to £9,000 a year for university students became a rallying cry for Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party during the general election campaign and was widely regarded as having helped to boost support among younger voters.

Speaking at a conference in London on Saturday, Green, who as first secretary of state is effectively May’s deputy, said it was one of the issues the Conservative party must consider carefully as it learned the lessons of the election result.

But the universities minister, Jo Johnson, was among those who responded by defending the current system.

And speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Gove said: “I believe fundamentally that the purpose of government policy is to support everyone equally, and if you don’t benefit from a university education, you shouldn’t have to pay additionally to support those who do.”

The environment secretary also suggested he was in favour of ending the across-the-board 1% pay cap for public sector workers, saying the government should heed the advice of the public sector pay review bodies.

Some of the eight pay review bodies have already begun to issue warnings about the problems of recruitment and retention if the cap persists until 2019-20, as the Treasury currently intends.

They give advice in the context of government policy, taking the 1% cap as a starting point, but Gove said: “They take account of that, but they also take account of other questions as well.”

He said: “These pay review bodies have been set up to ensure that we can have authoritative advice on what is required in order to ensure that the public services on which we rely are effectively staffed, and that people within them are effectively supported.”

A growing number of ministers, including the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and the education secretary, Justine Greening, are urging the chancellor to make more funds available in the autumn budget to lift the cap.

Gove also defended the Conservatives’ deal with Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party to shore up May’s minority government, at a cost of more than £1bn in additional investment.

“The reason why we are investing in Northern Ireland – and it’s not just DUP voters, it’s all the people in Northern Ireland who are getting this additional investment – is that there are some unique problems that flow from the Northern Ireland Troubles,” he said.

He said it was unfair to the people of Northern Ireland to characterise the payment as a “bung”.

Gove also pointed out that some aspects of the agreement would benefit voters across the UK, singling out the retention of the triple-lock on pensions. A Tory manifesto pledge to do away with it was ditched at the behest of the DUP.

Pressed on how the extra money would be found, he said: “It comes, as all other taxpayers’ money comes, from you and I and other hardworking people.”

Matthew Taylor, who headed No 10 policy unit under Labour leader, will look at a range of issues, including workplace insecurity and anxiety, parental rights and access to pensions and holiday pay

The former head of Tony Blair’s policy unit has been hired by Theresa May to head a review of workers’ rights and practices, which will try to address concerns that millions are stuck in insecure and stressful work.

Matthew Taylor, who worked for Blair before heading the Royal Society of Arts, will undertake the “review of modern employment”, looking at why so many low paid workers are anxious about their jobs.

Writing for the Guardian, Taylor said he would examine the “particular problem with job security” in modern Britain that affects millions of people.

I’ll tell Theresa May what’s wrong with modern work | Matthew Taylor Read more

“While 92% of people consider job security to be important, only 65% people think their job is secure and 15% think it is insecure – that’s around 5 million people wondering if they will be able to pay the bills each month, or what will happen to the mortgage if they’re suddenly out of work,” he said.

He said stress in employment used to be correlated with seniority. Now those with lower incomes are just as likely to suffer anxiety at work.

“What’s more, around 6 million people are not covered by the standard suite of workplace rights,” he said. “Worryingly, that number continues to grow, and it shows how rapidly changing business models and working practices are continually stretching the limits of our employment rules.”

He said the current system works for the majority of people but there are many who work flexibly and may need better protections. In particular, it will look at how new forms of work might undermine the effectiveness of policies such as the minimum wage, maternity and paternity rights, pensions auto-enrolment, sick pay, and holiday pay.

Taylor is an unusual choice for May, as someone who has advocated the concept of a form of universal basic income in the longer term – a policy being examined by Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell.

Last month, he also said the government’s flagship new benefit system, universal credit, was on the way to joining an “inglorious list” of disasters alongside the poll tax and rail privatisation.

Despite being politically neutral in his RSA role and having helped write election manifestos for Labour, Taylor said credit should be given to May for looking at how to extend workers’ rights.



He said the review would be independent and based on conversations with workers in different jobs and types of employment across the country. It may also examine longer term potential trends in work such as automation, which could make millions of traditional jobs unnecessary.

In terms of the longer term trends, he said he would like the review to think about a future world of work where many more people work flexibly and how “we can have a tax and welfare system that is properly resourced” to reflect that.

“It will be really important to get out and listen to people. I don’t just want to be crunching data and numbers. I want us to get out and explore what these issues about modern work mean in very different labour markets and different parts of the country. We will have to be guided by what people tell us.”

The opposition is likely to be sceptical of such a review given the Conservatives have presided over an increase in job insecurity over the past six years and a refusal to ban zero-hour contracts, arguing that many workers like the flexibility.

Corbyn has drawn attention to the corporate behaviour of businesses such Sports Direct, BHS, and the Byron burger chain, which he said in July has “driven home the reality faced by a huge number of workers today: a race to the bottom in insecurity, low pay, stress and exploitation”.

Labour pro-remain campaigners and trade unions also warned repeatedly that Brexit could lead to a watering down of employment rights, as many derive from EU law.

However, the move fits in with May’s attempt to make helping those who are “just managing” a major theme of this week’s Conservative party conference in Birmingham. It also suggests she is mounting an attempt to move on to Labour’s turf and address the concerns of voters who opted for Brexit in the hope that it might improve their circumstances.

She claimed to be “building a new centre ground in British politics”, which would involve improving pay, security, and the employment rights of ordinary working people.

“Flexibility and innovation are a vital part of what makes our economy strong, but it is essential that these virtues are combined with the right support and protections for workers,” May said. “The UK has one of the strongest labour markets in the world – with record numbers of people in work, and an unemployment rate almost half the EU average.

“That’s a proud record, but if we are to build a country that works for everyone – not just the privileged few – we need to be certain that employment regulation and practices are keeping pace with the changing world of work.”

A study shows that those not guaranteed work hours are less likely to feel healthy than peers with more stable jobs

The toll of zero-hours contracts on the health of millennials has been revealed in a study that showed those not guaranteed a minimum number of work hours were less likely to feel healthy than peers who had stable contracts.

The research, conducted by the UCL Institute of Education, also showed that those on zero-hours contracts were at greater risk of mental health problems. The study was released as part of research looking at young people’s experiences of work.



It has prompted concern among unions and MPs, who are calling for the government to crack down on exploitative employment arrangements.

If you work in the public sector, we’d like you to share your thoughts and experiences of the decade-long cap on pay increases

Ministers are calling on the public sector pay cap to be reconsidered, after a new report found median hourly earnings of UK workers dropped in real terms by almost 6% between 2005 and 2015, with some sectors suffering worse drops than others.



Labour said the figures were highly significant, damning evidence of “the harsh and unfair reality of the Tories’ pay freeze on hard-working public sector workers”, whose earnings are decided by the government in contrast to those in the private sector.

Pay rises for five million public sector workers are set by independent pay review bodies, but have been capped at 1% since 2013, before which there was a two-year freeze on pay for all but the lowest-paid workers.

The teaching profession has seen average pay fall by £3 an hour in real terms and police officers by £2 an hour, while the wages of nurses have stagnated during a decade of public sector salary freezes. Police officers saw a median real earnings fall from £20 an hour to £18 an hour, and prison officers saw median real earnings fall from £16 an hour to £15 an hour over the same period.

The issue of public sector pay is expected to come to a head at a meeting of the cabinet on Tuesday morning, after signals from a series of influential ministers, including Boris Johnson, Jeremy Hunt, Justine Greening and Michael Gove.

Teachers, nurses and police officers have seen their take home pay fall or stagnate in real terms following a decade of salary freezes, analysis shows

The teaching profession has seen average pay fall by £3 an hour in real terms and police officers by £2 an hour, while the wages of nurses have stagnated during a decade of public sector salary freezes, a new report for the government’s pay advisers has found.

The academic analysis was quietly published on Monday before a crucial cabinet meeting where Theresa May and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, are likely to face pressure from colleagues to agree a timetable for easing seven years of public sector pay restraint.



The report, commissioned by the Office of Manpower Economics – which supports the independent bodies making recommendations on public sector pay, found median hourly earnings of UK workers dropped in real terms by almost 6% between 2005 and 2015, with some sectors suffering worse drops than others.



Labour said the figures were highly significant, damning evidence of “the harsh and unfair reality of the Tories’ pay freeze on hard-working public sector workers”, whose earnings are decided by the government in contrast to those in the private sector.



The issue of public sector pay is expected to come to a head at a meeting of the cabinet on Tuesday morning, after signals from a series of influential ministers, including Boris Johnson, Jeremy Hunt, Justine Greening and Michael Gove, that the 1% cap on wage rises ought to be reconsidered.

The Guardian view on public sector pay: Hammond stares into the abyss | Editorial Read more

Tory MPs and ministers have suggested the Treasury fund the change by scrapping planned tax cuts including to corporation tax and by raising the threshold for the 40p rate.



The chancellor is thought to be frustrated that so many senior colleagues are lining up to pressure him into action, with allies stressing that he was the one to relax his party’s fiscal rules.



Officially, Downing Street insists that there is no plan to lift the cap. However, in a sign that action could be imminent to address worries about morale and recruitment in the public sector, senior figures inside both Downing Street and the Treasury admitted that something needed to change, even questioning whether it was feasible to wait until an autumn budget in the face of demands from Tory MPs.

A source stressed that both Hammond and May had spoke out about hearing the message of the general election, in which the Tories lost their majority in the face of an anti-austerity promise from Labour.

In a speech to the Confederation of British Industry on Monday night, Hammond said the government’s approach to balance the needs of public workers with those who had to pay the bill hadn’t changed. However, he said he recognised that “the British people are weary after seven years’ hard slog repairing the damage of the great recession”.

He also said the time had come for a conversation on the level of funding of public services but it had to be a “grown-up debate” – arguing that borrowing was simply passing the bill to the next generation and that taxes couldn’t always fall on someone else.

The new report found a 3% drop in median hourly earnings between 2005 and 2015 for workers in 32 public sector occupations whose salaries are set by the government on the advice of independent pay review bodies.



It found median hourly pay fell by an even greater amount – 6% – during that period for workers across the board, as the recession of 2008 hit wages hardest in the private sector.

But the report showed George Osborne’s policy of pay restraint on public sector workers began to bite after 2010, as police officers, teachers, midwives, radiographers, nurses and doctors saw a marked decline in median hourly earnings.

According to the study by Professor Alex Bryson at University College London and John Forth, a fellow at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research:

School teachers saw a drop in median real earnings from £25 an hour in 2005 to £22 an hour in 2015.



Police officers saw a median real earnings fall from £20 an hour to £18 an hour over the same period.



Doctors experienced a drop from £38 an hour to £30 in median real earnings.



Prison officers saw median real earnings fall from £16 an hour to £15 an hour.

Nurses reported median real earnings of £16 an hour in 2005, rising to £17 an hour in 2010, before dropping back to just over £16 in 2015, showing a slight rise of 1.4% over the decade.

The hourly median wage figures were adjusted for inflation, based on 2015 prices and rounded to the nearest pound.

Labour’s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the research underlined the need for urgent action, claiming “empty words or infighting from members of the cabinet” was not enough when key public sector workers were turning to foodbanks.



“This a damning report that reveals the harsh and unfair reality of the Tories’ pay freeze on hard-working public sector workers,” he said, claiming May was failing to meet a basic test of fairness.

“The fact that some of the pillars of our community and the public sector, such as teachers, nurses and police officers, are seeing their pay cut exposes the complete duplicity of a government which likes to praise their work, but will not actually truly reward it.”



Public sector workers need a pay rise – even Tory voters think so | Frances O’Grady Read more

McDonnell called on the government to “step aside” and let Labour lead the country in the national interest.

A number of senior Tories believe May needs to take action after Corbyn’s promise to better fund public services and end tuition fees energised younger voters and those working in the public sector.



Research showed that the Tories trailed Labour by five points with public sector workers, who were significantly more likely to vote than their private sector counterparts – with turnout at 76% compared with 66%.

Dr Sarah Wollaston, the Tory MP who chaired parliament’s health select committee up to the election, said there was considerable strength of feeling among her colleagues on the backbenches and in cabinet that action was needed to ease the pain.

“It is not a matter of if, but when,” she said, arguing that the issue was not just about public sector pay but properly funding public services. “And the discussion should move onto how we pay for it.”

She said that everyone ought to contribute but with the burden falling more on the better off and with “intergenerational fairness” also taken into account.

Pointing out how controversial it had been when the Tories had suggested a new policy for social care in its manifesto, Wollaston called on the prime minister to ask all political parties – including Labour – to sit down and discuss how to fund this.

“That may mean taking ideas from everyone’s manifestos – including Labour’s,” she said.

Although Hammond is minded to look at how to ease the burden on workers, he is likely to challenge cabinet colleagues – who he considers to be lobbying ahead of the budget – to spell out what difficult tax decisions they would consider to pay for any changes. Another option is to find more departmental cuts.

As well as the interventions for health and education workers, Sir Michael Fallon – the defence secretary – will also make the case for military personnel.

The latest research will add to the pressure on the chancellor over public sector pay. But some Conservatives may point to the finding that private sector workers have had an even worse time during the recession, and make the case that the cap should therefore continue.

Prof Bryson, co-author of the report, said the big difference between private and public sector employees was that the latter are “public servants [and] as such, the government can determine their annual pay settlement”.



He said: “When deciding what to do, government will weigh public concern over pay equity for groups like nurses, and experts’ concerns regarding public employers’ ability to recruit, retain and motivate staff, against the potential costs of lifting the 1% cap for the public purse.”



Bryson said the private sector had seen unprecedented falls in real wages after the financial crisis and then the public sector followed that downward trajectory after 2010.

“It’s not a good picture for virtually anybody,” he said. “The labour market in Britain has been suffering badly whether you are in the private or public sector. I think it’s going to be a question for the government not if but when and how they are going to address the build-up of pay pressures in the public sector.”

He said the falls in public sector median hourly wages looked somewhat less bad when the figures are adjusted for changes in the workforce, such a shift to younger or less experienced workers.

He added: “But arguably one of the reasons why you have younger or workers of less tenure might be that they are responding to the relative earnings that they can get in the public sector.”

Pay is not the only issue of austerity that is causing tension for the government. Gary Porter, the Conservative chair of the Local Government Association, will use a keynote speech to warn that councils will have lost 75p in every £1 of central government funding by 2020. He will say that local authorities should be at the front of the queue in any easing on austerity.

Calling for local government to keep business rates that are collected locally, Lord Porter told the Guardian that failure to act would leave councils “skint”.

“[Ministers] are aware of the issue – they know that councils will fall over if they don’t come up with something,” he said. “They have a year to get it sorted or those councils go bust.”

Pressure is also mounting from unions representing workers. In an article for the Guardian – Janet Davies, who leads the Royal College of Nursing, said she was encouraged from a shift in mood in government.

“For every day that the cap remains in place, the official register of who can practise as a nurse is haemorrhaging more names than are added,” she said. “The government must lift this cap and close the gap on lost earnings.

“It has been a political decision not to give the NHS the money it needs and the resulting cuts and pressures put patient care at risk.”

When Theresa May took the stage at the Conservative party conference last autumn she reprised her pledge for a fairer economy. Specifically, she homed in on pay growth, or the lack of it.

“Our economy should work for everyone, but if your pay has stagnated for several years in a row and fixed items of spending keep going up, it doesn’t feel like it’s working for you,” the prime minister declared.

Fast-forward to this summer and the one in six workers who ply their trade in the public sector will know exactly what she is talking about. Living costs are rising at an increasingly rapid pace and, thanks to a cap imposed by May’s government, public sector pay is falling behind.

Under the Conservatives’ austerity drive, a large part of the pain has been borne by public sector workers – a broad cohort ranging from low-paid NHS workers to high-paid civil servants. Their pay was frozen in the financial years 2011-12 and 2012-13 – except for the lowest earners. Rises were then limited to an average of 1% from 2013-14 to 2015-16, and then capped at 1% again for the next four years. It remains to be seen if May and her cabinet colleagues, weakened by last month’s election shock, will soften that stance.

The current squeeze on public sector workers is in stark contrast to the years of the global financial crisis. Their pay was relatively protected after the crash while earnings in the private sector fell. Average weekly earnings for the public sector were £479 in 2011, up 9% from £439 in 2008. In the private sector, average weekly earnings were up just 3% over the same period to £448 in 2011, and that was before taking into account inflation. But thanks to government-set pay restraint, public sector workers have missed out on the recovery in wage growth in recent years.

Now that the pound’s sharp drop since the Brexit vote is pushing up import costs and stoking inflation, that pay restraint is being felt even more acutely. Wages are falling in real terms for many public sector workers or, in other words, the cost of many goods and services is rising faster than their pay packets. That is also the case for private sector workers, but their real wages are falling at a slower pace.

As the Resolution Foundation thinktank recently noted: “The scale of the current public sector pay squeeze is much tighter than in the private sector, and will continue for some time too.



“While real growth up to the end of 2016 was 1.6% for the private sector, it had fallen to 0.3% for the public sector.”

Official figures for April, when inflation was 2.7%, showed that average weekly earnings were rising 1.2% on a year ago in the private sector and just 0.8% in the public sector.



For public sector employers that squeeze is causing serious problems when it comes to recruiting and retaining workers, as shown by the news that more nurses and midwives are now leaving the profession than joining it. That has knock-on costs for the public sector when hospitals and other places of work are forced to rely on agency staff to fill the gaps.

Looking into what is pushing people to leave the public sector, the TUC says many workers cannot make ends meet any more. It points to polling of 21,000 health service members last year by the public sector union Unison, which found that one in 10 had pawned possessions to ease their cashflow problems, and a similar proportion had used payday loans.

The TUC’s own analysis suggests there is worse to come. It calculated that nurses, firefighters and border guards will all see their real pay drop by more than £2,500 by 2020 if the government sticks to its 1% cap.

It is worth noting that going by simple sector-wide averages, those employed by the state are still earning more than those in the private sector. Public sector workers earn about £25,000 a year on average and for the private sector it is £22,500, says Jonathan Cribb at the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank.



“But once you control for education, age, where people live and their experience, the difference is quite small,” he adds. Furthermore, the gap is narrowing.

Based on current plans and on forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government’s independent economic forecaster, the IFS says private sector pay will rise six percentage points faster than public sector pay between 2016-17 and 2020-21. That would reduce the average difference between public and private sector pay to a level not seen in at least the last 20 years and to one that is “well below the level seen in the early 2000s when there were shortages of nurses,” notes Cribb.



But the government will be wary of rushing into any big policy changes to fix its recruitment troubles. John Hawksworth, the chief economist of accountancy group PwC, says the public sector pay bill was about £180bn last year.

“So if you were to raise the public sector pay rise to 3% for the next three years it would cost you an extra £10bn by 2020 compared with current plans,” he adds.

“So I guess there’s a clear case for doing it in terms of recruitment and retention and fairness … but on the other hand it is a significant amount and has to be weighed in the overall fiscal balance against other priorities.”

Reader responses to the Grenfell tragedy, including from Dave Welsh , who recalls north Kensington’s spirit of resistance to spending cuts, and the Rev Roger Abbott who draws comparisons with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina

In 2007 I got a job working for HISTORYtalk, a local community history project in North Kensington based at the Methodist Church opposite Grenfell Tower on the Lancaster West Estate. My job soon brought me into contact with the proud tradition of resistance to oppression, racism and discrimination that has been at the heart of community politics there for decades: the fight against Rachmanism and slum housing, for play space and community facilities, against the racist attacks of the 1958 riots and for justice following the murder of Kelso Cochrane and to establish the Notting Hill Carnival.

In 2011 the Conservative council announced £22m in cuts. A huge meeting at the Lighthouse on Lancaster Road heard Tony Benn and Bob Crow denounce the cuts and call for a campaign to fight austerity. Shortly after, a lobby of the full council heard a speech by the local Unison secretary who said: “The people of this borough will never forget your decision. The people of this borough will never forgive your decision.” The Conservatives simply ignored our pleas and went ahead with the cuts. Those words have proved prophetic. The cuts, the indifference and the arrogance of the council have been made graphically clear by the Grenfell fire, and a new generation that will lead the fight for rights and justice has been born.

Dave Welsh

(Ex-secretary, Kensington and Chelsea trades union council), Norwich

• From my recent experience during five days as part of a volunteer group in attendance in the Lancaster Green community, current concerns about the apparent attitude and practices of Kensington and Chelsea borough council in the light of the Grenfell Tower fire tragedy bring sad comparisons with observations from my fieldwork in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.

Relationships there between federal, state and local agents failed catastrophically, leading to a disaster of enormous and tragic proportions, made all the more tragic by a failure to build relationships of trust, truth, justice and compassion. I see similar outcomes emerging from the Grenfell Tower incident; in particular, relationships between national government and the Kensington and Chelsea borough council and local residents.

Public servants are mandated to give survivors respect, dignity and truth, all mixed with a humanity of profound compassion. Public servants who do not possess such virtues do not deserve them being shown in return. Indeed, they do not deserve to hold office either.

Rev Roger Abbott

• Deborah Orr (Opinion, 30 June) is unfortunately absolutely right in all she says about the Grenfell catastrophe. A contempt has developed for health and safety considerations and they are considered a pathetic nanny-state approach. This, coupled with the worship of cost-cutting at the expense of humanity, has caused this tragedy. Even though I understood that terrible things were happening in the name of austerity I must admit I still thought we lived in a country that used regulation to require housing to be built or altered so as to offer adequate fire protection. Not if you live in social housing it seems. Could that be any more shameful?

• Photographs show that the cavity barriers as well as the thermal insulation that formed part of the rainscreen cladding system were Celotex RS5000, a polyisocyanurate foam that emits hydrogen cyanide in a fire. Although the cavity barriers had remained largely intact, they had failed to contain the fire at the level of the outbreak. The fact that the fire spread so rapidly suggests that the fixings of the metal cladding panels had simply failed.

The insulation boards were in a charred state following the fire. The manufacturer, Celotex Saint-Gobain, believes that the material met the requirements of the building regulations, the BRE (Building Research Establishment) report BR135 and had a Class 0 fire performance. Class 0 materials are supposed to be of limited combustibility but are only equivalent to the Euroclass B; the third level below Euroclass A1 (non-combustible). The Euroclass fire test methodology is considered to be superior to the classification system used in the building regulations because it predicts the performance of materials in real fires more accurately.

Why did the government approve such inadequate fire safety standards?

• Nicholas Paget-Brown should not have resigned as leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (Report, 30 June). Anyone who has had to solve crises in public life knows that it is much better to discuss a range of ideas with experienced people in private than to jump in with a fast, dramatic, solution which is then generally ridiculed because it has not been thought through properly.

Careful and responsible planning is also impossible if the people directly affected by the crisis are in the room and baying for blood while the opposition press are reporting it all in the most lurid terms possible.

Dr Richard Turner

Harrogate

• When the government is presented with the dilemma of appointing a leader to chair a major national inquiry why confine the choice to retired judges and ex-politicians, ie, members of the establishment? Why not instead use as a yardstick that of the consummate professional?

There are many such individuals working, for example, within the health, social work and education sectors. Then we might avoid the trap of idiosyncrasy and expect the person appointed to use high ethical standards and common sense.

Sociologists, for example, lean on several rich theoretical perspectives to shape professionalism as a concept and various analytical frameworks have been used to understand how different professions have developed their identity.

A principal consideration is to examine in whose interests professionals work – themselves, their clients, the general public, the state, patriarchy? Also what role does power play in their operations?

The neo-Durkheimian framework, for example, emphasises disinterestedness, bringing cohesion and implies commitment to welfare state values or particular altruistic codes of behaviour. A neo-Weberian framework emphasises social closure and professional dominance and introduces the notion of professionals seeking to exercise power other others. This is developed further in an analysis of neo-Marxist and post-Structuralist frameworks which draw out the nexus of power relations that underpin professional relationships including that which a profession holds with the state, specifically with regard to the latter’s capacity as an employing authority.

Of topical importance is the perspective of democratic or collaborative professionalism which extends the role of accountability to widen the range of stakeholders, and in particular to achieve greater responsiveness to client groups. The end result may produce a more focused job specification.

• One of the most disturbing aspects of the Grenfell Tower disaster is the large number of people in the building who were killed and who are unknown. There are a number of possible explanations. One is that a black market has developed within social housing in London. People living in social housing and claiming housing benefit or claiming it to pay rent on privately owned apartments are subletting illegally.

We knew it happened. No one knew the extent until now. Those of us living in the provinces and commuting amazing distances to find work may need to move to find work but cannot move into London and the south-east because of the lack of social housing provision. We have plenty of houses in this country. They are just not in the same place as many available jobs. What serious attempt has there been to move jobs out of London to address part of that problem? None as far as I can see by the civil service since Harold Wilson moved the DVLA to Swansea, the Royal Mint to Cardiff and the Ministry of Education to Darlington, 50 years ago.

Kelso Cochrane, a 32-year-old carpenter from Antigua, was living in west London when he was murdered by a gang of white youths. He had fractured his thumb at work, and was heading home from hospital late on Sunday 17 May 1959 when they set upon him. It was a year after the Notting Hill race riots, and his death outraged the community. Police denied it was a racist killing, and the case was never solved.

In this photograph, published in the Daily Mirror a few days later, police are hunting for the murder weapon, believed to be a six-inch stiletto knife. According to the article, the man in the suit is a detective, and the other is a council worker.

I was six. Edenham Street in north Kensington, where we are standing, doesn’t exist any more, torn down with neighbouring streets in the slum clearances of the late 60s to make way for the Trellick Tower. Cochrane was murdered about a hundred yards from where this picture was taken.

I have a disconnected memory of asking my parents about a serious fight that had taken place, and being told it was just an argument after a party. Looking back, I’m convinced it was the murder connected to this scene that I was talking about.

It is slightly shocking to see my six-year-old self out by myself; none of the other boys are my friends. But back then life was played out more in the streets: I think it made us more self-reliant and sociable than kids today. I remember a mobile cinema, with a screen fixed to the back of a van that parked in nearby Southam Street during the school holidays.

The late 50s were turbulent times in north Kensington, which was a solidly working-class area. Attitudes to the huge influx of West Indian migrants ranged from mistrusting to hostile. I remember signs in the windows of houses advertising rooms, saying: “No blacks, no Irish.”

My father was a Polish immigrant, who came to the UK in 1946; he’d fought in Italy with the British army during the war. My family – me, my brother and my parents – lived on the ground floor of a four-storey house on Kensal Road. There was one family on each floor. We had our own kitchen and an indoor loo – the height of luxury. We left the area in 1966 and moved to Croydon, which was an up-and-coming multiracial area.

I decided to visit my old neighbourhood a few years ago; it had changed so much that I decided to write a blog about my memories of it. It was during my research that I discovered this photograph. I recognised the street before I recognised myself. Some of my long-lost primary school friends have since made contact, and we now meet up every three months in the area, take a walk, and talk about the old days. Last year we helped our old school with its local history project.

In October 1959 Oswald Mosley stood in the general election as a candidate for the old Kensington North constituency, on an anti-immigration platform, calling for the forced repatriation of Caribbean immigrants. He came last. Today, a plaque to Kelso Cochrane stands on Golborne Road, opposite the place he was murdered.

Photo purportedly shows pilot and navigator on a dock in the Marshall Islands in 1937 – under Japanese rule at the time – but some experts remain unconvinced

A newly unearthed picture from the US national archives has given new credence to a popular theory about the disappearance of pioneering aviator Amelia Earhart.



Some experts say the image shows the pilot, her navigator Fred Noonan and her airplane in the Marshall Islands in 1937, when the archipelago was occupied by Japan – proving that she died in Japanese custody, rather than during a crash landing in the Pacific.

“When you pull out, and when you see the analysis that’s been done, I think it leaves no doubt to the viewers that that’s Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan,” Shawn Henry told NBC News. Henry is the former executive assistant director for the FBI and an NBC News analyst.

Kent Gibson, a forensic analyst who specializes in facial recognition, told the History Channel that it was “very likely” the individuals pictured are Earhart and Noonan, in a programme on the Earhart mystery scheduled to air this Sunday.

Not everyone is so convinced, however. “There is such an appetite for anything related to Amelia Earhart that even something this ridiculous will get everybody talking about it,” said Ric Gillespie, author of Finding Amelia and the executive director of the The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (Tighar).

“This is just a picture of a wharf at Jaluit [in the Marshall Islands], with a bunch of people,” Gillespie said. “It’s just silly. And this is coming from a guy who has spent the last 28 years doing genuine research into the Earhart disappearance and led 11 expeditions into the South Pacific.”

The picture was discovered by retired federal agent Les Kinney, who scoured the national archives for records that may have been overlooked in the now 80-year-old mystery of Earhart’s last flight.

It was 2 July 1937, toward the end of her history-making flight around the world, when the 40-year-old Earhart vanished somewhere over the Pacific Ocean. The crash has long been blamed on poor weather conditions and a technical failure with the plane’s radio system. Most historians believe that Earhart ran out of fuel, crashed into the Pacific Ocean and sunk to the ocean’s darkest depths.

But since no trace of Earhart, Noonan or her Lockheed Electra airplane have ever been confirmed, alternate theories have abounded for decades. This past November, another forensic breakthrough supported an alternate theory that Earhart may have died a castaway on an island in modern-day Kiribati.

Gillespie is an exponent of this account and believes there is copious evidence to support it, including the timing of radio transmissions received after the plane was no longer airborne, the location of human remains on the then uninhabited island, and items he and his team have recovered – including a popular US women’s moisturizer, a zipper from a jacket and a makeup case.

“We found the site, we’ve done three excavations there and we’re finding artifacts that speak of an American woman of the 1930s,” Gillespie said.

Solving the mystery of how aviator Amelia Earhart disappeared Read more

The Marshall Island theory, which the photograph is alleged to support, has been around since at least the 1960s and fueled by accounts from Marshall Islanders who claimed they saw the aircraft land and saw Earhart and Noonan in Japanese custody.

Kinney found the most recent photograph stamped with official Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) markings reading “Marshall Islands, Jaluit Atoll, Jaluit Island, Jaluit Harbor”. The photograph has been credited to a US spy.

In the photo, a ship can be seen towing a barge with an airplane on the back, and on a nearby dock what appears to be a woman with a short haircut can be seen sitting, facing away from the camera. Gillespie notes, for what it’s worth, that the woman’s hair is far too long to be that of Earhart, of whom pictures exist from just a few days earlier.

“It wasn’t that long [a period of time] and hair doesn’t grow that fast,” Gillespie said.

Also visible is the face of a man who several experts told the History Channel is Noonan. The picture “clearly indicates that Earhart was captured by the Japanese”, Kinney said in History’s investigation.

Japanese officials have stated on more than one occasion that they have no records of Earhart or Noonan ever having been in their custody, but many of the nation’s records did not survive the second world war.

The singer says he felt ‘terrorised’ by the armed officer who he says detained him for half an hour and screamed in his face

The singer Morrissey said on Wednesday that he had been “terrorised” by a police officer in Rome who held him at gunpoint for half an hour on a busy street.



The former lead singer of the Smiths, a long-time fan of Rome who had returned to the Italian capital to record an album, said the officer unlocked his gun and “screamed into my face” as a crowd of more than 100 people watched.

Morrissey’s nephew Sam Esty Rayner, a photographer who often takes footage of the singer, posted a picture of the officer and wrote his motorbike’s licence plate number on Facebook.

“The Police Officer pictured below terrorized Morrissey for 35 minutes demanding ‘papers’. Morrissey had no papers,” Rayner wrote.

Morrissey in a statement accused the officer of a “deliberate act of terror” and said he had not broken any law. “I believe he recognised me and wanted to frighten me. I did not back down even though I believed he was about to shoot me,” Morrissey said.

“I urge people to beware of this dangerously aggressive officer. He might kill you,” he said.

Morrissey has frequently criticised the police both in his music and off-stage. In 2015, he said he was “sexually assaulted” by an officer at San Francisco International Airport who touched him during a security check.

Mae West was taken to court for writing The Drag – a play about a closeted gay socialite that ended up banned. Polly Stenham, who’s directing a revival, celebrates the star who took a limo to jail

When Mae West’s play The Drag was first performed, in Connecticut in 1927, its author was starring as a prostitute in the scandalous Broadway hit Sex. That show was soon deemed indecent, earning her a 10-day jail sentence. She took a limo to prison and said she wore silk underwear throughout her detention. The Drag proved no less controversial: it lasted for 10 performances before it was banned.



Why the fuss? Partly because West was a woman writing about sexuality and, in particular, gay male sexuality. The Drag, subtitled A Homosexual Comedy in Three Acts and written under the pseudonym Jane Mast, is about the cost of living with a secret life. Its hero is a closeted gay socialite, Rolly Kingsbury, who comes “from one of the finest families” and is trapped in a loveless marriage. Rolly’s father is a homophobic judge, his father-in-law a therapist who specialises in gay conversion. West herself had been a male impersonator early in her career, and the play culminates in an elaborate drag ball, with largely improvised dialogue and a jazz band on stage.

The Drag was inspired by her many gay friends. She knew their daily struggles to be open about their relationships, and to be accepted for who they were. When casting the play, she actively sought out gay actors. As a playwright she is compassionate, but also very funny. From performing in stage revues and burlesques, West had gained a reputation as a sex symbol and, as someone who was subjected to it herself, she had a particular understanding of the male gaze. This gave her an interesting angle when writing from a homosexual man’s point of view.

West’s casting of gay men was incendiary at a time when the actors’ union barred them from parts with lines. Likewise the manner in which she auditioned them: open casting calls at a gay bar in Greenwich Village. In her autobiography, she claimed to have “helped a lot of gay boys along” by casting them at a time when “producers never gave speaking parts to homosexuals”.

When it opened in Connecticut, The Drag was a success with audiences, although Variety called it “an inexpressibly brutal and vulgar attempt to capitalise on a dirty matter for profit”. West had hoped it would run on Broadway but it never made it. One Broadway producer said it was “the worst possible play I have ever heard of contemplating an invasion of New York” and that it “strikes at the heart of decency”.

West’s take was that audiences were “too childlike to face like grownups the problem of homosexuals”. The Drag was just too risque for the mainstream. West rewrote the play a year later as The Pleasure Man, sanitising it by making the lead character straight, but she still faced criticism for it being too explicit. Like Sex, The Pleasure Man eventually landed her in court.

The Drag deals with guilt, shame and families falling apart over secrets. As the director of a new revival at the National Theatre, I have been fascinated by its strong elements of farce – that’s quite a traditional form to explore such subversive content. It has an anarchic streak, too, which I’ve always liked and I hope there’s always one in my own plays, which have also been concerned with family dynamics.

The play feels very nonjudgmental: it just poses the situation. I’m constantly trying to remind myself how radical it was. West had a lot of status, she was a public woman, so I think it was very brave of her to put it on. Women today are still outnumbered in the arts. Back then, 90 years ago, she was a playwright in an extremely male-dominated profession. That’s radical in itself – but if you consider the kind of plays she wrote, she can be seen as an activist too. Outsiders always appeal to me and that’s what West was.

While The Drag is very much of its time, the play is certainly still relevant. I think it’s easy to forget, living in a liberal city like London and working in the arts, as I do, that it’s still tough for gay people around the world. Just look at the reports about Chechnya’s detention centres for gay men.

The Drag is about a very specific subsection of the LGBT community, with its focus on upper-middle-class, white, cisgendered men. In her autobiography, West talks about what compelled her to write it and her other plays that “brought down the howl of the too pious”. She describes feeling “a strong compulsion to put down a realistic drama of the tragic waste of a way of life that was spreading into modern society, at a time when any mention of it was met by ordinary people with a state of shocked horror”.

Things have undeniably moved on but, despite all this progress, we still haven’t fully attained equality in the UK. I find it patronising that gay marriage has only been a thing for a few years. It’s a human right to be able to get married. It’s so important to keep the Pride celebration going, keep it visible. I’m looking forward to the day when there will be married gay grandparents.

"I used to be Snow White, but I drifted."

"Is that a gun in your pocket - or are you just glad to see me?"

"When I'm good, I'm very good, but when I'm bad, I'm better."

"Beulah, peel me a grape."

It is tempting to remember Mae West only for her lines, verbal and visual. Her bold, sly use of innuendo and double entendre - and her full-breasted body as a kind of slithery punctuation mark to her low-down humour - made her a legend in her own time. It pleased her greatly when the RAF dubbed its inflatable life-jacket a "Mae West" during the second world war. By then, her showbiz career was virtually over.

She died a cult figure, a sex goddess from Hollywood's Golden Age who mercilessly subverted conventional morality by not only insisting, but demonstrating, that carnal pleasure was fun and could be guiltless. For West the only sin was hypocrisy.

"I take it out in the open and laugh at it," she said à propos sex. Under those sequined, form-hugging, floor-length gowns she always wore was a fully self-conscious artist who wrote her own dialogue, produced her own plays, bossed her own movies.

"It isn't what I do, but how I do it," she said with accuracy. "It isn't what I say, but how I say it and how I look when I do it and say it."

Essentially, West was a late-Victorian stage performer who survived into the atomic age because she was toughly independent as well as a comedienne of genius who understood, and was capable of exorcising, her audiences' sexual terrors. She was the Lenny Bruce of the 1930s.

She was always impersonating herself impersonating Mae West parodying a male impersonation of a woman. Depression cinema patrons, chuckling over her hip-swaying caricatures of Diamond Lil or Klondike Annie knocking lecherous men over like ninepins with her fliply insolent sensuality, knew only that she was shrewdly spoofing something that was supposed to be too sacred or sinful to joke about.

Censorship, her mortal enemy, eventually brought her down. Among her selfappointed agents of public purity, the publisher William Randolph Hearst used his vast newspaper chain to pillory her ("Isn't it time Congress did something about Mae West?"); at the same time he was keeping Marion Davies in an adulterous affair. Mae West would have seen this as typically male behaviour.

Bryan Avery, who has died aged 73, was an architect whose fascination with advanced technology was matched by a passion for cities and landscapes, and a determination to innovate in everything he touched. His work ranged from graphic design and a patented light fitting through nationally significant cultural buildings such as the home of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) and the London Imax cinema to a visionary project for a sustainable future that he called Wilderness City. His sketchbooks were filled with details of architecture, plants and all kinds of machines.

Bryan came to national attention in 1988 with the British Film Institute’s Museum of the Moving Image, located beneath the approach to Waterloo Bridge. With its clip-on cladding and kit-of-parts structure it was unmistakably hi-tech but also evoked the glamour of film. It closed in 1999, but not before catching the eye of Richard Attenborough, the chairman of Rada’s governors, which led to Bryan being commissioned for the comprehensive redevelopment of the academy’s Bloomsbury base. The resulting intimate performance space is among the most flexible in London, and at the heart of the tightly packed accommodation is a narrow, top-lit cleft at whose base the sun caresses a bust of George Bernard Shaw.

Bryan Avery won an RAF scholarship to train as a pilot but, hearing about the future of unmanned aircraft, thought a career in architecture might be more secure

One of Bryan’s last commissions exemplifies the combination of practicality and visionary leap that typified his career. Asked by international planning consultants to explore the possibility of improving access along the north side of the Thames between Blackfriars and Tower Bridges, he devised a 12m-wide boardwalk, supported by a series of “camp sheds” – historic structures designed to support barges at low water. The proposal, which won support from the City, London mayors (Boris Johnson and Sadiq Khan) and the Port of London Authority, is still alive, but whether money will be found to take it forward is unclear.

The son of Robert Avery, a leather worker, and his wife, Helen (nee Mogg), Bryan was born in Aston Upthorpe, Berkshire (now Oxfordshire). The family moved to the New Forest, where he attended Brockenhurst grammar school. There his talent for sketching developed alongside a passion for planes, landscapes and buildings. He won an RAF scholarship to train as a pilot but, on hearing the minister of defence extolling the money-saving potential of unmanned aircraft then under test, he decided a career in architecture might prove more secure.

He studied architecture at Leicester College of Art, then enrolled on a new master’s course in architectural theory at Essex University. Run by two future luminaries of architecture education, Joseph Rykwert and Dalibor Veselý, it transformed his vision of the cultural possibilities of architecture.

Bryan’s love of advanced technology led him to work on prefabricated housing with the Greater London council and for the component development consultancy Anthony Williams and Burles, before establishing his own practice in 1982. The fascination with systems of proportion and importance of context, developed at Essex, informed everything he did, from tiny, Sir John Soane-inspired commercial interiors to the Museum of the Moving Image.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest A rehearsal in progresss at Rada’s base in Bloomsbury, London, designed by Bryan Avery

Invited to transform an unprepossessing 1960s office tower at Neathouse Place, near Victoria station, Bryan provided one elevation with angled glazing to frame the sky and direct the eye down to the street, and furnished the other with a series of oriels addressing Westminster Cathedral. The project was completed in 1996.

The Rada building led to a succession of arts projects, including the expansion of Repton school’s theatre, the refurbishment of a music performance space for the Royal Over-Seas League at Park Place, St James’s, and the London Imax cinema. Built on a former roundabout adjacent to Waterloo station, the Imax, finished in 1999, was conceived as a brightly lit solid drum within a clear glass one, radiating fragmentary glimpses of a vast Howard Hodgkin painting. It became that rare thing, a genuinely popular new landmark.

The Imax also exemplified Bryan’s talent for handling difficult sites. He was regularly called in to work behind the scenes on projects where larger practices struggled to satisfy the planning authority. One such, in which his contribution was publicly acknowledged, was a collaboration with Sidell Gibson on offices adjacent to the Old Bailey.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest A detail of Bryan Avery’s design for the Museum of the Moving Image

Alongside commissions and invited competitions, Bryan devoted considerable time to the pursuit of self-generated projects, grouping many into his Wilderness City – a vision developed over 20 years, incorporating such ideas as super-high-density low-rise housing. One aspect of this is now orthodoxy – increasing the density of urban settlements – and some of his more provocative rural ideas, such as the downgrading of minor B-roads, have been advocated by the National Trust. His take on sustainability was idiosyncratic but deeply thought through, leading a reviewer of his book Fragments of Wilderness City (2011) to describe it as offering “the clearest exposition of urban dis-integration I have encountered”.

As a resident of Pimlico, in central London, Bryan was active in his residents’ association, offering professional advice on a voluntary basis, and he enjoyed nothing more than walking and talking to friends and then putting thoughts to work. He responded to frequent invitations to lecture, typically framing the discussion of his work around his guide for students, The Seven Cs of Architecture. He developed a close relationship with Ion Mincu University of Architecture and Urbanism in Bucharest, Romania, which awarded him its Bene Merenti medal. He was appointed MBE in 2015.

He is survived by his wife, Gabby (nee Friedrich-Steen), and his daughter, Karen (“K”), from his earlier marriage to Ellen (nee Morgan), which ended in divorce.

Fan lends former Wimbledon champion a hand at Tesco buying six cans of Diet Coke – with no plastic bag

Rafael Nadal may know his way around grass and clay courts, but the Spanish tennis ace struggled when confronted with a supermarket self-service checkout machine.

The former Wimbledon champion, now world No 2, was spotted shopping for groceries in a local Tesco Express by a fan, who offered to lend a hand.



He bought six cans of Diet Coke, though did not purchase a carrier bag, according to fellow shopper Nick Roberts, who shared his excitement on Twitter.

“Just done Rafa Nadal’s shopping for him on the self service tills on the tesco express in Wimbledon village. Surreal,” he wrote.

He added: “It was very exciting. He bought a 6 pack of Diet Coke. Didn’t need a bag. Environmentally conscious and awesome at tennis.”

“Oh, and he was lovely with everyone in there. I hope he doesn’t mind that I’ve tweeted about this. I was just really excited!”



BBC presenter Clare Balding said on Today at Wimbledon that a colleague had also seen Dustin Brown, who faces Andy Murray on Wednesday, in a local branch of Marks and Spencer.

The playwright, who died last year, made provisions in his will to ensure any remaining manuscripts were never published. But, as with Nabokov and Kafka, will his dying wishes be ignored?

Name: Edward Albee.

Age: He was 88 when he died last year.

Appearance: Man of letters.

Writer, was he? He was arguably the greatest American playwright of his generation.

Anything I might have seen? His most famous play was Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

Anything I might have seen lately? Imelda Staunton recently played the lead role in a London production of it, and Albee’s other works are performed all the time. His play The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia? just finished a run in the West End. A revival of his Pulitzer prize-winnning Three Tall Women, starring Glenda Jackson, is due on Broadway next year.

Was he working on anything when he died? We may never know.

Why not? He requested that all his unfinished manuscripts be destroyed after his death.

Yeah, but he’s dead now, so … And he left strict instructions in his will to that end.

Can you do that? You can try, but such attempts – legally known as “dead hand control” – have a chequered history.

Just give me the highlights. Franz Kafka requested that a friend burn all his manuscripts unread, but the friend read them anyway, and later published them, including The Trial.

So a masterpiece was rescued from the bonfire of self-doubt. Then again, an incomplete last novel of Nabokov’s was published – against his express wishes – in 2009, to terrible reviews.

It sounds as if it is perfectly legal to comply with instructions for destruction, but it is also sort of OK not to. I’m no lawyer, so yes.

How do Albee’s executors intend to play this? They mean to honour his wishes. Already this year the estate has intervened to prevent a black actor from being cast in a production of Virginia Woolf.

That’s attractive. It’s what he would have wanted, they say.

Do we even know if there is anything at stake here? The last Albee play we know about, Laying an Egg, was originally scheduled for production in 2012, but was then withdrawn – twice – by the playwright, who said it wasn’t ready.

I think the title might have been the problem – the review headline would write itself. It’s too bad he’s not around to benefit from your advice.

Do say: “The artist has the right to decide the fate of his work, and we’re obliged to protect that right.”

Don’t say: “Why don’t we just burn the will?”

~_~

Edward Albee, who has died aged 88, has been described as both the first modern American playwright and the last great American playwright after Eugene O’Neill, Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller. In reality he was probably neither, although he was undoubtedly a substantial talent, who burst on to a stagnant American theatrical scene with The Zoo Story in 1959 and followed it up three years later with that major masterpiece of marital disharmony, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

Although Albee was to continue writing all his life, and had minor success with plays such as the Pinteresque A Delicate Balance (1966) and All Over (1971), it was not until 1991 that he had a late creative blooming and another theatrical hit with Three Tall Women. Like much of Albee’s best work, Three Tall Women was strongly autobiographical, drawing on his privileged but loveless childhood and memories of his mother, Frances, a domineering, Junoesque beauty who preferred horses to people, and almost anyone to her adopted son.

He was born in Washington, to Louise Harvey, and immediately given up for adoption. Aged 18 days, he was handed into the care of Reed and Frances Albee, of Larchmont, New York. Reed was the wealthy, womanising son of the vaudeville theatre-owner and manager Edward Franklin Albee, and Frances (nee Cotter), better known as Frankie, was his third wife. It was rumoured that she had married Reed for his money. A childhood friend of Albee’s was subsequently to remark: “It’s lucky he was adopted. He would not get much talent from those two.”

Edward Albee, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? playwright, dies aged 88 Read more

A dreamy child with a penchant for drawing and music, the young Edward may not have wanted for material wealth, but grew up an observant outsider in his own home, ignored by his monosyllabic father and reviled by his mother. “My mother and I disliked and mistrusted each other,” said Albee in an interview many years later, recalling that she would frequently tell him: “Just you wait until you are 18, and I’ll have you out of here so fast that it’ll make your head spin.”

In fact Albee was 20 before he left home, after an argument. Apart from a chance encounter, he never saw his father again, and he had no further contact with his mother for 20 years, although she was regularly to appear in different guises in his plays: as Mommy in The American Dream (1961), Martha in Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Agnes in A Delicate Balance and, most famously, as Three Tall Women, written shortly after her death in a creative act that Albee likened to an “exorcism”. Mother and son may never have reached rapprochement, let alone anything approaching love, but Frankie was as much a muse for Albee as she was a monster.

Albee spent the next 10 years living in and around Greenwich Village, bolstered by the $25 a week interest payments from a trust fund he had inherited from his grandmother, and occasional work as a telegram boy for Western Union. The ordinary people he met while tramping the city, their desperation and loneliness, became the inspiration for The Zoo Story. But he was also moving in artistic circles. By 1952 he was living with, and in the shadow of, the talented young composer William Flanagan.

After the success of The Zoo Story, the myth grew up that it was Albee’s very first play, apart from a three-act sex farce written when he was 12 and destroyed by his mother. In reality, between 1949 and 1959, he served an intense apprenticeship, writing at least nine plays as well as short stories and poems. The Zoo Story, about two men sitting on a bench in Central Park, was started a month before his 30th birthday as, Albee was later to claim, a birthday present to himself. He was immediately aware that, for the first time, he had written something “worthwhile”.

New York theatre producers took longer to persuade, and The Zoo Story received its world premiere in a German translation at the Schiller theatre in Berlin on 28 September 1959. It was part of a double bill that included Samuel Beckett’s Krapp’s Last Tape. It was not until January 1960 that the play had its US premiere, at the Provincetown Playhouse in Greenwich Village. As was to be the case with almost all of Albee’s subsequent work, the reviews were mixed, but the positive ones were enthusiastic enough to turn him from an unknown into a hot young playwright who was being mentioned in the same breath as Beckett and Ionesco. America had its first avant-garde playwright in the European mode.

The playwright John Guare was to subsequently write of “the debt that every American playwright writing after 1960 owes to Edward Albee”. The British playwright Tom Stoppard, whose early work was strongly absurdist, has said that it was seeing The Zoo Story that made him determined to become a playwright. But the Beckettian undertones of The Zoo Story, the Ionesco-influenced The American Dream, and A Delicate Balance, with its Pinter-like dialogue and sense of menace, left many wondering whether Albee was anything more than a clever imitator hitching a ride on the coattails of the latest theatrical fashion.

The tendency to imitate was apparent even in his later work. Reviewing The Play About the Baby, which premiered at the Almeida in 1998, Michael Billington in the Guardian suggested that Albee was self-referring and cannibalising his own work. “The play is more a treasure trove for Albee scholars and biographers than something of universal concern.”

In his 20s, Albee had taken up again and then dropped his childhood hobby of drawing and painting. He was later to remark: “I realised I felt nothing beyond a certain curiosity, and I was making imitations that looked, to my eye, every bit as good as the originals.” This question of authenticity was always to raise itself in critical assessments of Albee’s plays. Although his defenders hailed him as a distinctive theatrical voice and great experimenter who refused to be pigeonholed, his detractors claimed that he remained derivative in form and content. Yet if there was any play that countered that latter view, it was Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? It also provided Albee with his only major commercial success, and gave the lie to the notion that he was incapable of writing a full-length play.

The title came from a piece of graffiti that Albee had spotted in a Greenwich Village bar some years previously. Set on the campus of a small American college, it has middle-aged Martha, the daughter of the dean, who is married to George, the assistant professor of history, arriving back home after a party. In tow are the new young biology teacher, Nick, and his wife, Honey. What follows is a bilious and drunken few hours in which Martha and George indulge in game playing and fantasy, wounding both their guests and each other. Martha reveals a son that the pair have invented, a revelation that George tops by “killing” the imagined boy off. This imaginary or absent son was to become a recurring figure in Albee’s work.

His friend Mel Gussow, the critic, said that, although Albee was to write many more plays, “Virginia Woolf was the cornerstone of his career: one play feeds all. In it, we can see strands reaching back to The Zoo Story (the act of confession, death as the final relief) and The American Dream (the household as microcosm) and forward to A Delicate Balance (the meaning of friendship and loyalty) and Three Tall Women (the price of parenting, the tricks of memory).”

Although it was a commercial success and in 1966 made into a film directed by Mike Nichols and starring Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor as George and Martha, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? had by no means wholly ecstatic reviews. A lack of critical appreciation of his work was something that Albee learned to accept. “I have been both over-praised and under-praised. I assume by the time I finish writing – and I plan to go on writing until I’m 90 or gaga – it will equal itself out.” He almost managed it: Me, Myself and I, another play drawing on mother and son relationships, was produced in 2008, when he was 80.

But at one point it seemed unlikely that Albee would be writing plays in his later years. After Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, his career went into serious decline and for the next 20 years his ability to write was affected by his love affair with alcohol, which had begun while he was still a child and would be asked to mix cocktails for his parents.

Deborah Kerr in Seascape, 1975

Tiny Alice, premiered on Broadway in 1964 with John Gielgud and Irene Worth, was greeted with such incomprehension that Albee found himself forced to hold a press conference to explain its meaning. Even the author could not satisfactorily explain the bizarre story of a lay brother who is sent by a superior to the house of a wealthy woman and is enmeshed in a scenario of sexual hysteria, religious ecstasy and martyrdom.

A Delicate Balance, described by Kenneth Tynan as “an exquisite fandango of despair”, saw Albee return to the familiar territory of his adoptive parents’ life style. A beautiful play about “what happens when we turn our backs upon ourselves”, it was a success and won Albee the Pulitzer prize he had been unjustly denied for Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

Although Albee continued to write plays and have them produced, most notably the death-watch drama All Over and his second Pulitzer-winner, Seascape (1975), a play in which two lizards intrude upon a marriage, his reputation was in free fall. Seascape ran for just two months. The disaster of The Man Who Had No Arms, about a man who sprouts a limb and achieves celebrity, only to see it wither as his arm atrophies, which closed on Broadway after just 16 performances in 1983, suggested that it was all over for Albee too.

His strength as a playwright was that he continued to experiment with form and content all his life

He did not need to write plays. Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? had made him a wealthy man, and he was renowned as a discerning collector of 20th-century art. For the next 10 years, the focus of his life shifted from writing plays to teaching and encouraging younger playwrights. He was a committed and generous teacher.

After his father’s death in 1961, Albee had resumed some contact with his mother, but the relationship remained difficult, not least because of Frankie’s refusal to acknowledge her son’s homosexuality or his long-term partner, the painter and sculptor Jonathan Thomas, who did much to help Albee overcome his dependency on alcohol, and who predeceased him. Her death in 1989 spawned Three Tall Women, a poignant and entirely fictionalised arm’s-length look at Frankie as a 92-year-old, by now bed-ridden and incontinent, who is also glimpsed aged 52 and 26. In 1994 it was awarded a Pulitzer prize.

There was another unexpected and late career gift in The Goat, or Who is Sylvia?, seen in New York in 2002 and at the Almeida in London and in the West End in 2004, about a successful architect in an apparently happy marriage who falls in love with a goat and has passionate sex with it. The London production boasted a brilliant central performance from Jonathan Pryce and an early stage appearance from a young Eddie Redmayne as his gay teenage son, in a savagely funny and dark examination of the limits of tolerance and the monsters that lurk beneath the exterior of modern middle-class everyday life. It was every bit as powerful and harrowing as Albee’s masterpiece.

If his upbringing ensured that intimacy remained a problem for Albee all his life, with even some of his closest friends referring to him as “mysterious” or “unknowable”, in his best work he was always present and always painfully revealing of his lost childhood and the barren, unhappy lives of his parents and their friends, and the best and worst that lurks in all of us.

His strength as a playwright was that he continued to experiment with form and content all his life. A lazier, less passionate playwright might have contented himself with rewriting Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? in different ways, or just quit when the critical reception got rough. Albee may never have been able to summon the emotional openness to match Williams’s honesty, grotesque comedy and lyricism, nor the political commitment to match Miller’s state-of-the-nation acuteness, but he was no also-ran. Rather he was one of the triumvirate who changed and shaped postwar American playwriting. The Zoo Story, A Delicate Balance and Who’s Afraid Of Virginia Woolf? will never want for production; they dissect our desire to hide behind illusion with a devastating and unflinching accuracy.

• Edward Albee, playwright, born 12 March 1928; died 16 September 2016

Mantel says The Mirror and the Light – the sequel to Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies – may not be published until 2019

Hilary Mantel’s hotly anticipated final instalment to her Man Booker-winning Wolf Hall trilogy is unlikely to appear next summer, the author said this week. Responding to a question from the audience in her latest Reith lecture for the BBC, she said it was “increasingly unlikely” the book would be published in 2018 as she had previously hoped.

The novel, which completes the story of Henry VIII’s doomed right-hand man Thomas Cromwell, will be titled The Mirror and the Light. The first two books in the trilogy – Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies – both won the Man Booker prize, making Mantel the first author to win for consecutive books.

Hilary Mantel: why I became a historical novelist Read more

Asked about the final instalment, Mantel said: “It simply depends when it comes in … you know, publishing goes in seasons. If I can get it [finished] early in the new year, it might very well come out in later summer. But I have to say that this is looking increasingly unlikely.”

The book may not appear until 2019, said Mantel, who denied that her failure to finish the novel to schedule was a sign of reluctance to write about Cromwell’s execution in July 1540. “People ask me if I’m having trouble killing off Thomas Cromwell. No, why would I?”

Fear of disappointing fans of the trilogy appears to be the main cause of her slow progress on the novel, which will cover the period from Anne Boleyn’s execution in 1536 to Cromwell’s fall from power four years later. “It is 10 years’ worth of effort and it is lovely to have the encouragement of people who are waiting for it, but that’s why I want to deliver them something that is the very best,” she said.

Wolf Hall was published in 2009 and Bring Up the Bodies in 2012. The books have been successfully adapted to television and stage. The Mirror and the Light is expected to follow suit, with Mark Rylance set to reprise his award-laden role as the doomed chancellor who rose from Putney butcher’s son to chief architect of Henry VIII’s schism with Rome.

“As soon as [Cromwell is] dead, he will get up, put on his head again and charge on to the TV screen … and quite possibly there will be another stage play. So it’s simply a way-station on his road to triumph,” Mantel said.

The novels have been criticised and lauded in equal measure for providing an alternative portrait of Cromwell, one of the most controversial figures in British history. As well as engineering the split with Rome, he plotted Boleyn’s fall from grace after she failed to provide Henry with a son, and was responsible for the torture and execution of Catholic dissidents including Sir Thomas More.

In the Reith lecture, the penultimate in a series that has explored the factual hinterland of historical writing and novelists’ and playwrights’ responsibilities, the author admitted that her view of the chief protagonist of Wolf Hall was provocative, but added: “My tendency is to approach the received version with great scepticism and try to get the reader to challenge what they think they know.”

Mantel has written a number of historical novels using real-life figures. Her 1992 novel A Place of Greater Safety focuses on the French Revolution and the lives of George Danton, Camille Desmoulins and Maximilien Robespierre, the notorious architect of the Reign of Terror. In 1998, she published The Giant, O’Brien, a novel about the Irish giant Charles Byrne and the Scottish surgeon John Hunter.

Of her approach to historical fiction, Mantel said: “You’re always looking for the untold story, you’re looking for what has been repressed politically or repressed psychologically. You are working in the crypt.”

Hilary Mantel is witchy. She conjures up the past with impeccably precise language, but the result is magic: stranger than mere history, more resonant. And her voice! So high pitched, it’s as though a child savant is speaking. Or – yes – a sorcerer. Dumbledore talking with the voice of Dolores Umbridge. If Grayson Perry’s Reith Lectures were a version of standup comedy, Mantel’s are a long enchantment, the casting of a spell.

Last week, we heard Mantel give her first lecture, recorded in Manchester. She made jokes about wallpaper. She used her ordinary history – someone once told her: “I come from a long line of nobodies” and she thinks that of herself – and expanded it to explain how she does what she does. Her technique is to get as many facts right as she can, researching the period, checking details obsessively: then her imagination takes over. Real characters speak made-up words. They seem real. “The dead are invisible,” she said. “But they are not absent.” And, answering an audience question: “History is not science. It’s humanity.” Mantel’s mind is exceptional; her voice, too: to hear her speak is delicious.

It’s not often you hear someone like Mantel given voice on the radio: older, female, northern, falsetto. And Radiotopia’s new series, Ear Hustle, sells itself as letting us hear from people we don’t usually hear speak. It’s a podcast made and broadcast from inside San Quentin, the US prison north of San Francisco. Except… I seem to have heard and seen many, many series based inside US prisons. And the voices didn’t seem so different: mostly black men, with rumbling tones, gorgeous slang. What was different was what they spoke about. This, the opening episode of 10, was about “cellies”, or cellmates. One man was sharing with a man who wanted to kill him. Two brothers were initially overjoyed to be cellies together – and then… Co-presenter/producer Earlonne Woods, an inmate, spoke of how his cellmate had been released and he was on the look out for a new one. (Bear in mind that the cells are 4ft by 9ft, with bunk beds, lavatory and washbasin squashed in; cellies need to be able to get along.) Co-presenter/producer Nigel Poor, an artist (who is not in jail), pushed Woods on how he finds someone to share with and, in doing so, revealed her own prejudices and assumptions. Sensitive stuff, but funny, too.

Ear Hustle beat 1,536 other entries in a competition to become an official Radiotopia podcast. As a celebration, the network’s established sister programmes are offering their own incarceration-themed episodes, under the blanket title Doing Time. I recommend Squatters of the Lower East Side from 99% Invisible; Radio Diaries’ The Rubber Room; Mortified’s Mortified, Interrupted… try any one of them, you won’t be disappointed.

Another man who knew about the inside of a prison cell was Chuck Berry. On 6 Music, we were treated to a programme made by Anthony Wall, who interviewed Berry in the late 1970s and made a radio show from the tapes. At the time, no one wanted it. But when Berry died last March, Wall offered it to 6 Music, which rightly snapped it up. Berry spoke of music and poetry, of love. His music weaved in and out. A dreamy tribute.

Baltz taught photography in Switzerland for the last decade of his life. ‘Among the qualities that most attracted me to photography were its transparency (illusory, of course) and its (equally illusory) sense of being almost authorless,’ he said. ‘The vernacular that interested me wasn’t the “snapshot aesthetic” but the commercial photograph in a “documentary” style – the sort you might see in a real-estate office window: high-resolution, artless, and very distancing.’ Lewis Baltz, a photobook retrospective, is published by Steidl

Tinkers Bubble will stay lodged in my memory for ever. When I recall it, I can smell the grass. It’s unique among low-impact, ecological communities around the UK in being almost entirely free of fossil fuel. They occasionally use paraffin lamps in winter, but all the work they do, they do manually. Haymaking takes place over a couple of days in June or July. I was spending a week there, volunteering and taking photographs, so I joined in.

We got up early each day, at about 4.30am, and worked until about 12, when we’d stop for lunch under a tree: bread, cheese, some cider. It is a beautiful bit of countryside, about a 20-minute walk from the nearest village, Stoke-sub-Hamdon in Somerset. And it was amazing to work in that ancient way, scything, using a pitchfork to turn the hay. You pick up a bundle and turn it in the air and watch it fall down. What made it really special was that we were doing it for Samson, the shire horse in the picture – it was all for his winter feed.

This photograph was taken on the second day, shortly after lunch. A strap on Samson’s harness broke and everyone had to stop. I went to sit under a tree, and when I looked over, I saw this timeless scene, which seemed to capture not just that moment but the culmination of the whole two days, and everything about life in the community. It’s one of only two handheld shots in my series. Immediate, and backlit to some extent, but with a beautiful light.

A trip to Glastonbury festival in 1994 first sparked my interest in this type of community. Some people were demonstrating how to build a bender – an eco-dwelling made of hazel-wood poles, bent and tied and covered with canvas. The structures we build and the communities they embody have always been a way of understanding the world, and these benders stuck with me. In 2004, I decided to record communities around the country living in these and other kinds of low-impact structures. Tinkers Bubble was the second I found – they’d been going for a decade already when I met them. It sounds like a fairytale name, but it’s the local name of a stream on the land where tinkers used to water their horses.

Scything is hard labour. Living this way is very hard – it takes a person with a good set of skills. And the community has fought hard to do what they do, with their appeals for planning permission going all the way to the High Court. In the 90s, the government decided their subsistence farming wasn’t a practical pattern of land use: it was not sustainable in any wider national sense that other people could live like this. But after the Conservatives lost the election, in 1997, the community reapplied. In 1999, they got permission to continue for five years. This permission has since been renewed and extended but it still remains temporary.

The beauty of the scene captured here is countered by the weight of the politics. But it also represents this idea of a simpler life. Like Henry David Thoreau spending a couple of years in his hut at Walden Pond, it taps into a desire to figure out what you truly need in life. At Tinkers Bubble, when someone is poorly, everyone helps. They eat communally every day, taking turns to cook.

Samson died a few years after this photograph was taken, and is buried on the grounds. He was a great horse – it took the community a long while to find another. Horses are central to everything they do, from the communal logging business to pub outings. There is another shot, of everyone coming back from their local, where we’d gone for a drink. There’s something very special about going to the pub in a horse-driven cart, tying him up on the street outside and sitting in the garden so we can keep an eye on him.



Life inside Tinkers Bubble is refreshing, and I remember how amazed I was on my first visit. I parked my car and walked up a path through an orchard, past Samson grazing in his field, climbed over a solar-powered electric fence, walked past allotments and polytunnels, solar panels and a wind generator and then up a steep hill that got steeper. At the top, sheltered from view under a canopy of Douglas fir, were a handful of dwellings arranged around the communal roundhouse. Each first visit I made to a community was wonderful. I felt as if I’d arrived in a parallel reality. I couldn’t believe that, in 21st-century, Britain people were living like this.

‘People think Angel, the woman in this picture, is a hooker, but she was a student nurse. If you’re into hip-hop in New Orleans, that’s the look’

I went to America last year and made friends with Star, a tall, twee elderly guy with an afro. This is his house in New Orleans: such crumbling, 1920s architecture is typical of the south. Star grew up in New Orleans at the height of the jazz age, when it was known as the Big Sleazy. It was a party destination, with people flocking to its clubs and casinos from all over the US.

Star’s grandmother ran a brothel from this house, with girls working in different rooms. When he hit his teens, Star fled to California and worked as an orange picker. Then his grandmother died and he inherited the house. He drove back in that old blue Cadillac you can see out front and was in the middle of renovating the building when he heard Hurricane Katrina was coming. So he escaped to Texas – that’s why the car survived – but the building was mashed. You can see all the detritus from the storm on the kerb on the left, still there almost 10 years on. He was given a huge grant to fix his house, but there’s been a lot of corruption. The contractors did a terrible patch-up job then disappeared. He’s trying to fix the electrics with what little cash he has left.

The girl is called Angel. I met her in a club in the French quarter. I thought the two of them would get on. So, one Saturday afternoon, I suggested we all go out for burgers. I’d just dropped them back at Star’s house and was about to drive away when I saw Angel walking off, just as the sun was going down. I grabbed my camera and took a shot.

People who see this picture always think Angel is a hooker, but that’s not true at all. She’s Liberian, her parents came from Africa a few years ago to start a new life, and she was studying nursing. The clothes are just a fashion thing. It was a Saturday night, she was going out clubbing, and if you’re young and into hip-hop in New Orleans, that’s the look.

This is part of a series I took all over America called The Gods – a celebration of the culture and community around hip-hop. I photographed people in strip clubs, on the streets and in gangs. There are no nine-to-five jobs. It’s a good life while you’re young, but it doesn’t always work out. A lot of the guys end up in prison or dead. The Gods is the name given to older hustlers who made it: they survived the streets and prison – and now they’re the big boys.

Angel wasn’t like that, though. She spent most of her time studying. She went out to clubs and parties, but it was different for her because she wasn’t born in New Orleans. When you migrate, everything is fresh and positive and you want to make the most of it. A lot of the people I shot – their grandparents had been slaves. When you’re in the south, that’s very recent history.

Karl Lagerfeld doesn’t do things by halves. For this season’s spectacular couture show, it was the turn of the Eiffel Tower to get the Chanel treatment, as models walked under the arched legs of a reconstruction in Paris’s Grand Palais.

Returning to the wide, exaggerated silhouette he championed in his last haute couture collection, the effect was bold and modern, while maintaining Chanel’s classic love of tweed.

The US has celebrated its 241st birthday. The Fourth of July marks the anniversary of the country’s independence from British rule, and is a national holiday that sparks myriad local parades

~_~

The holiday to commemorate the country’s independence from British rule saw Donald Trump head to the golf course, while other politicians went abroad

Ahead of Tuesday evening’s Fourth of July fireworks displays, Americans celebrated the country’s 241st birthday on the ski slopes, abroad and, in the case of the president, at their golf courses.

The holiday, which commemorates the country’s declaration of independence from British rule, is known for traditions including neighborhood block parties, local parades and Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest.

This year, Joey Chestnut devoured 72 hot dogs to win his 10th championship title in the contest, held at New York’s Coney Island. Miki Sudo won the women’s competition by eating 41 hot dogs in 10 minutes.

Donald Trump and Mike Pence were scheduled to appear at a military families picnic on the White House’s south lawn for an evening Fourth of July celebration.

During the day, Trump was at his golf course in Virginia. He has visited a Trump golf course on 36 of the 165 days he has been in office, according to NBC News. On the campaign trail Trump had said he loved golf but would not have time for it as president and criticized Barack Obama for his time playing the game.

Congress is in recess this week, and a group of US senators, including Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, and John McCain, an Arizona Republican, are visiting Afghanistan. They were there to assess US strategy in the conflict, which the country has been engaged in for more than 15 years.

The senators said there is not yet a strategy for peace and expressed concern over efforts by the White House to reduce the diplomatic presence there.

“Each of us may describe that concern in our own way but none of us would say that we’re on course to a success here in Afghanistan,” said McCain.

On Tuesday, NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who refused to stand for the National Anthem at games, posted a video of his travels to Ghana on social media.

The holiday celebrates the ratification of the Declaration of Independence, but Kaepernick’s video referenced an aspect less frequently acknowledged. The document declared that “all men were created equal” – though it was signed by 56 men, many of whom owned slaves.

“How can we truly celebrate independence on a day that intentionally robbed our ancestors of theirs?” Kaepernick said. “To find my independence I went home”.

Thomas Jefferson’s original draft of the declaration included a condemnation of the slave trade, though that was ultimately edited out. A handwritten copy of his unedited version of the document was being displayed at the New York Public Library for the holiday.

The library was also one of dozens of sites to host a naturalization ceremony for incoming citizens tied to the Fourth of July. More than 15,000 people are set to become US citizens at Independence Day-themed ceremonies that occurred late last week and early this week.

Possible rain storms threatened Fourth of July celebrations in the midwest, south and northeast, while the western US was dominated by hot, dry, weather – increasing the likelihood of dangerous wild fires.

In California’s Sierra Nevada mountains, at least two ski resorts remained open because of heavy winter snowfall – one of a handful of times the ski resorts have continued operations into July. Squaw Valley Ski Resort and Mammoth Mountain do not have a set date to end operations and it’s possible the resorts could remain open into the autumn.

Avid skier Jackie Megnin told San Francisco local news station KPIX: “It’s just really cool that we’re able to ski into the summer and really live out this epic winter.”

A recent puzzle had a theme which was mis-reported as a printing error. Themes and hidden messages may be more common than you think ...

I’ll be quixotic to avoid spoilers, but today seems quite appropriate for this question: is this a place to discuss quick crosswords?



Take the Times’s concise puzzle, which has been in the news. Devotees of that puzzle will have noticed, over time, that it is now never merely a set of definitions. One day, you might spot that some of the rows of the completed grid contain two-word phrases. Another day, perhaps, there are some symmetrically arranged Ks – as has happened in that paper and elsewhere.

Every so often, the theme is more explicit. Here’s a selection of down clues from Times2 Concise 7,358, published last month:



1. Large cat (5)

3. Cat (4)

6. Large cat (7)

7. Large cat (7)

12. Large cat (7)

13. Cat (7)

19. Cross between 21 down and 1 down (5)

21. Large cat (4)

And here’s the peculiar thing. The more obvious a setter makes his or her special feature, the more likely it is to be mistaken, not for a feature, but for a bug. The Mirror reported on the puzzle like this:

Clearly there was a malfunction in the printing of yesterday’s Times crossword, because it had many more people than usual scratching their heads.

Imagine how much head-scratching would be caused by the revelation that every single day, the Times’s second section publishes a puzzle with just such an “error”, some of them disguised with Bletchley-like levels of ingenuity (incidentally, the crosswords-in-D-Day story has reappeared this week in the Washington Post).

I’ve yet to work out when this Times tradition began: there is a long period in which, as far as I can see, there are no hidden extras, and a transition phase when special tricks appeared now and again. If you have any intelligence on this, please do share.



Because for me, the answer to the question at the top is: yes. If a quick crossword tries out tricks where, say, all the four-letter answers are anagrams of each other, that is surely wordplay. And if the wordplay might help the solver to get some answers where the definitional clues have not provided clarity, then you’re really talking about cryptic crosswording in disguise.

Over to you.

~_~

In a sister feature to our Meet the Setter series, we find out which words are used in cryptic crossword clues to indicate each of the letters of the alphabet.

You’ve met A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I and J. Now it’s time for the voiceless velar stop, better known as K.

Oh, K: here we are. Let’s talk about ...

Is this going to be yet another piece about how “unpopular” I am? About how I come twenty-whateverth in the most-used letters?

No, I want to discuss ...

Because you know what? I may not crop up that often in written English, but some people love me. Eastern Europeans. Bohemians. And spelling reformers.

Yes, I’ve seen that theory: that between Q, you and S, you’ve already covered all the jobs done by C.

Kwyte so. In fakt, if you ask me, we kood give Q and C the kybosh: have them killed off (like the kull of G). I think rational spelling would be a great suksess.

Yeah, good luck with that. By the way, not all Bohemians. Kafka ...

I know, I know. That line from his diaries.

OK, then how about the Greeks? When your readers see a word in a clue that means there’s a K in the answer, it’s probably Greek. Kilo, say, or kilometre. Or sometimes I’m indicated by just plain thousand.

Except when that thousand is $1,000 (G). Or when they should be thinking of Roman numerals (M) ...

Sure. Let’s move on to Scandinavia, then. Your basic Nordic currencies are abbreviated to K: krone, krona, not to mention króna. Or we could go to Asia. Cars from Cambodia have a K sticker ...

... because it used to be called Kampuchea. Those are the words that really stand out in clues. What are the common ones that solvers might miss?

I’d say knight (even knighthood) or king.

Again, though, in chess, a knight is an N. And on King George-era postboxes, the G is next to an R, not a K.

What’s your point, Alan?

I suppose ... that it’s not as simple as saying “Hey, we only need a K here.” Those spelling reformers? They would spell “knight” something like “nyte”.

But in old English, it was pronounced “ker-nikst”!

Knot know.

No.

And there, in a three-word exchange, are three examples of why our crazy spelling system can make words easier to identify.

Hmm.

So, know your place. Eleventh in the alphabet, twenty-somethingth in use.

... and – solvers might like to know for when they have got a K in a grid – probably followed by an E or an I, and most likely preceded by an O, an A or, most often, a C.

A completely redundant C.

Now, now.

’Kay then. Point taken.

Slang terms for bad weather make a non-topical appearance alongside the super-topical DUP in our roundup of the best of the broadsheets’ cryptic clues

The news in clues

Nutmeg (who we recently encountered in Meet The Setter) concocted a clue that evoked the swollen significance of nine men and one woman ...

23d August men in provincial party rising (5)

[ abbrev. for ‘other ranks’ (‘men’ meaning soldiers), contained in abbrev. for Democratic Unionist Party (‘provincial party’), all reading upwards (‘rising’) ]

[ OR inside DUP, all reversed ]

... and which also gave the answer PROUD. When the DUP/Tory deal duly failed to materialise at the allotted hour, an ironic ring appeared around this Telegraph clue ...

11d Queen to make a speech, having sufficient number in attendance (7)

[ abbrev. for ‘Queen’ + synonym for ‘to make a speech ]

[ QU + ORATE ]

... for QUORATE. And looking further afield, Hamilton reminded us of an earlier European entity ...

8d Condemn extra EEC harassment (8)

[ anagram (‘harassment’) of EXTRAEEC ]

... in a pithy clue for EXECRATE.

Latter patter

Eccles kicked off a puzzle last week with this clue ...

1ac Indian food’s cold, very cold (6)

[ type of curry + abbrev. for ‘cold’ ]

[ BALTI + C ]

... for BALTIC. This slang term for nippiness was this very month added to the Oxford English Dictionary as a draft addition, with citations chiefly Scottish and going back to the 1990s.

This raises a compelling question: is this spooky coincidence mere happenstance, or is someone with the appropriate lexicographic credentials a fan of the Independent crossword? And if the latter, does this mean that setters have the power to insinuate words into the nation’s dictionaries? Any intelligence on this topic is very welcome.

In the meantime, our next challenge concerns another term for coldness: one which, Partridge’s Dictionary of Slang suggests, alludes to the number of dingoes that an indigenous Australian supposedly used as a kind of living blanket. Reader, how would you clue TWO-DOG NIGHT?

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues for PRIME. I enjoyed the topical allusions such as Alberyalbery’s “Leading protestants rule in May’s eurosceptic brief” and Schroduck’s pointed “‘Fussy and English’ – the type of minister Gove wants to be?”.

Among the terser clues, there was much pleasure to be derived from Clueso’s “Neat finish from George Best”, Dcusch’s “Prepare before ringing 999” and ID2155366’s “A soft frost”.

The runners-up are Robinjohnson’s “Correct, constant and perfect” and Lizard’s “Magnificent Seven?”; Catarella had an astonishing array of approaches, from which I propose that “Parliament clearing Alan Turing ‘only the start’ for a significant number of mathematicians” is pleasing on at least four levels.

Clue of the Fortnight

Reader Anotherchrismiller expressed love for this architecturally sound clue by Philistine (Meet the Setter):

11/17/24ac So few into heritage plan renovated a listed building (3,7,5,2,4)

[ anagram (‘renovated’) of SOFEWINTOHERITAGEPLAN ]

And when THE LEANING TOWER OF PISA emerges into view, it is surely a sight worth seeing.

The latest in our series where we turn the tables on the torturers. Under the spotlight this time is Margaret Irvine, AKA Nutmeg

Nutmeg has been setting cryptics and quiptics for the Guardian for nearly a decade. She also sets for the Times and the Church Times, as well as some of those exigent puzzle series with barred grids.

The profile on her puzzle index tells us that “her interests include classical music and genealogy”; she is known for her smooth, elegant surface readings and her persistent fair play. So, let’s meet the setter.

When did you get the crossword bug?

At secondary-school age. My parents liked words and were crossword enthusiasts. I’m an only child, and a favourite evening family pastime was to tackle the day’s broadsheet cryptic.

I gradually learned the structure of clues, began contributing some answers and became hooked. Solving with others is, I believe, the best and most satisfying way to learn.

I was entrusted with the dictionary and my wandering eye lit on all sorts of fascinating words – nothing to do with the puzzle – some of which would never have cropped up in polite conversation.

How did you choose your pseudonym?

It started with MEG for Margaret, which narrows down the possibilities. NUT implies a degree of nuttiness, perhaps eccentricity.

How do you create your puzzles?

I aim to do seven or eight clues each day, so I’ll complete a puzzle in four days. Then I put it aside and tweak and polish it later, possibly several times.



I need to set one puzzle a week to keep on target. I tend to fill grids when the mood takes me and keep plenty of filled grids in hand, awaiting clues. Once I’ve decided which puzzle to clue, the words go into a notebook, which I carry around with me (with pencil and rubber!).

Often, I’ll be thinking about words and clues while walking to the shops or doing other things. Ideas sometimes occur at inopportune moments; I’ve been known to jot clues on the back of a till receipt or even on a pew sheet during a sermon.

What’s the difference between setting for the Times and the Guardian?

The Times’ house style is less permissive, but that has made me more inventive. The Guardian allows more variation and individuality, so setting is, on the whole, easier – for me, at least, since my primary aim is to entertain. My occasional attempts to add “humorous” touches to Times clues don’t tend to make it to the final puzzle.

What makes a successful clue?

Probably one that’s simple but misleading, with a good surface. But clues are successful for different reasons. Writing a truly outstanding clue is much harder, but I live in hope of achieving one. Just occasionally, a setter produces the perfect clue, such as Arachne’s …

5d Inflammation primarily found in maternal breasts (8)

… which has everything: conciseness, wit and an &lit to boot.

We’ll give the answer below. Speaking of Arachne, what was it like collaborating with her and Puck for World Toilet Day last year?

Interesting and fun. Collaboration was a first for me and, I believe, Puck – although Arachne had done two or three with other setters.

Given the theme, there was scope for a bit of fun while contributing to a good cause; I’d thank solvers again for their generosity, but Hugh touched on it in the Crossword Editor’s Update.

I think it worked because none of us tried to impose our own rules on the others. We all tried too hard to start with and spent a disproportionate amount of time on our own nine or 10 clues, not wanting to let the side down. Our first draft was much too hard; we needed to simplify some clues to give the solver a way in.

Given a suitable occasion, we’d like to do another.

What are the tools of your trade?

Collins Dictionary & Thesaurus is the main one, with Concise Oxford English Dictionary, Chambers Dictionary, Chambers Crossword Dictionary and Bradford’s Crossword Solver’s Dictionary. Plus all sorts of useful bits and pieces of information that have stuck in the memory over the years.

You never know what’s going to come in useful. I learned Latin for two years at school: I could cheerfully have done without it at the time, but it helps enormously with understanding the meaning and construction of words and grammar.

Which other setters do you admire?

Many, for various reasons, but I don’t want to offend anyone by omission. As a solver, I like those who set an entertaining, solveable puzzle with good surfaces, and without bending Ximenean rules too much.

As a setter, I admire those chaps (regrettably almost all are chaps) who have been setting regularly for years and yet still produce fresh, inventive puzzles. Finding one clue – or two or three – for a word may be relatively easy, but when you have something unpromising like EGRET for the nth time, the heart sinks. And the more puzzles you’ve set, the worse it must get.

I also admire setters who can change their style seemingly at will. One who springs to mind is Paul, whose Times puzzles are nothing like his Guardian style. My basic style stays the same, with small variations depending on the publication, but he seems able to switch completely. Incidentally, I’m totally in awe of anyone who can set a puzzle, without prior knowledge of the words, while running a marathon, as he will be doing. Devising the clues in the time is challenge enough, let alone the running.

How do you imagine a solver of your crosswords?

I don’t have a particular sort of person in mind, since solvers are such a mixed bunch. One thing I have learned is that you can’t hope to please everyone. I aim to entertain, while not making things too easy for the solver, and spend time polishing my clues to achieve smooth surfaces. As such, the one type of solver I don’t appreciate is the speed merchant, whose only aim is to complete the puzzle in the quickest possible time and who spends no time appreciating the honing that has been applied to the clues.



The exception is my Church Times puzzles, where it is fair to make assumptions about the range of knowledge that a solver will have. This is particularly useful in a puzzle that tends to have a religious or churchy slant. I enjoy setting any puzzle, but these are especially enjoyable.

You and Paul took part in a Woman’s Hour discussion on gender and crosswords, although I remember it strayed from gender almost immediately.

Yes, and the only question on the lack of female setters was addressed to Paul, not to me; not that I had any firm ideas, but neither had he!

I would like to have touched on some of the things that came up in my chat beforehand with the programme’s researcher – such as help available for novice solvers, the benefits of solving with others when learning – and I could have done without the question about timing myself on that day’s crosswords.

I’ve since discussed the shortage of female setters with Arachne, and she reckons lack of confidence is a major factor. I think there’s a lot in that, so I’d encourage any potential setters to have a go, as I did, rather than be put off by thinking you’re not good enough.

What’s the future for cryptic crosswords?

I really don’t know. Happily, the standard cryptic is still flourishing, and there are some good younger setters. No doubt clue styles will evolve, as they’ve always done – but slowly, I hope.

Personally, I deplore some of the (to me) sloppy cluing or iffy devices that have crept in, but I may have to bow to the inevitable.

How do people respond if you tell them that you’re a setter?

I usually keep it quiet, having found that it’s a complete conversation-stopper. I get responses such as “Oh, you must be clever, I can’t do cryptic crosswords”, “I’ve never been interested in puzzles” and, worst of all, the apologetic “I’m afraid I’ve never understood cryptic crosswords”, which makes you feel bad for having mentioned the subject.

And what do you do for a living besides setting crosswords?

I’m happily retired from an IT job at Manchester University, which started with (very satisfying) computer programming in the days before the proliferation of package programs, and later morphed into computer support and problem-solving.

Now I help at a local primary school, two afternoons a week, as an extra pair of hands with seven-to-eight-year-olds, and serve refreshments at a toddlers’ group one or two mornings a week.

I was lucky to retire early. At that time, I set myself the challenge of trying to make the grade as a setter, so what I’ve managed to achieve so far has been extremely satisfying and an enormous amount of fun.

Much like your puzzles. Many thanks to Nutmeg. The answer to the Arachne clue is MASTITIS.

The latest in our series where we turn the tables on the torturers. Under the spotlight this time is Shirley Curran, AKA Chalicea

Chalicea – known outside crosswords as Shirley Curran – is a prolific setter, especially of “advanced cryptics” for such series as the Listener, the Inquisitor and Enigmatic Variations and in magazines including the Magpie, 1 Across and Crossword magazine. She has also operated under other noms de guerre, including Gnomie and Curmudgeon. So, let’s meet the setter.

Where do you create your puzzles?

Ideas for themes occur anywhere and everywhere (on a plane, on a ski slope, half way down the page of a book) and I jot them in a notebook. Compiling is an obsession and I do it much of the day – at a computer, or fast asleep in bed when an idea wakes me and I leap for pencil and paper.

When did you get the crossword bug?

My mother was an avid and good solver. I started with the Sunday Express Skeleton (as did so many others), then moved on to the Guardian at university. I took to solving it regularly when my husband and I were first together and competed against another couple.

How did you choose your pseudonyms?

Chalicea began as a simple merging of CHARLES (husband) and ALICE (mum). Doc, the editor of 1 Across magazine, accidentally added the A and it stuck.

And Curmudgeon was an irritated reaction to comments from bloggers and editors such as “Chalicea writes such sweet, ladylike things”. Nobody makes patronising comments about Curmudgeon puzzles.

What do you do besides setting crosswords?

I am a retired language teacher and a qualified ski instructor. We live on the Swiss frontier and ski most days of the winter. I also look after my ponds full of tiny singing toads (bombina bombina, a rare breed).

How could you tempt a curious but frightened solver of regular weekday cryptics to the world of “advanced” puzzles?

The Magpie magazine is a good place to start as the clues in its easier crosswords are very much like those of the weekday cryptics. And solving alongside a more experienced solver can teach you the tricks.

Agreed. What makes a successful clue?

Clever and amusing construction coupled with a fine surface reading that may be deceptive. A good clue is short and sweet.



... and what makes an unsuccessful one?

Lots of cluelets each providing some of the letters of the solution and building up to an overlong humdrum whole.

Which other setters do you admire?

They are too many to list but I am particularly excited by some of the crosswords produced by the top Listener setters: Kea, Shark, Sabre and Shackleton. I have had the privilege of working with two of them and am stunned by their ability to create grids and write fabulous clues.

The Listen With Others site, to which you contribute, is very handy for solvers of that diabolical puzzle series – especially the accounts by setters of how the puzzles come to be.

The setters’ posts are very popular (we can see the statistics) and, over the years, I have got to know many of the compilers and can approach them for their enjoyable accounts of the struggles of compilation and the two-year queue their creations sit in.

What’s your favourite of your own clues or puzzles?

My greatest thrill came with my first Listener puzzle, which was based on Emily Davison. As there are so few ladies in the “crossworld”, my thematic crosswords often focus on females: for example, Valentina Tereshkova, Amelia Earhart, Edith Cavell, and one that you mentioned here in your feature on the lovely Anne Bradford.

My favourite is probably my most recent Enigmatic Variations puzzle, which honoured Dame Vera Lynn’s 100th birthday and featured WE’LL MEET AGAIN around the grid’s five sides (yes, five!).

I’m also rather fond of my naughtiest clue – “Short communication from abstainer full of piss (5)” – that I modified to placate a prim (and probably wise) editor.

We’ll give the answer below. How do people respond if you tell them that you’re a crossword setter?



“If” is the word. The words “devious mind” tend to come out but I think non-setting friends are quite pleased to think they know a setter. They often say “Maybe you can help me with this clue …”, which is a bit of a misconception. I am actually a pretty poor solver.

What’s the future for cryptic crosswords?

It was very worrying to see the demise of the Independent in its paper form and a relief when the i took over our IQ series – but I believe crosswords will always be an important part of the thinking man’s (lady’s) day. We feel that the online submission of solutions is a way to keep competition crosswords alive. Clearly that creates difficulties for series like the Listener, which appear in a range of shapes, but it is a way of keeping crosswords moving onward.

Finally, what do you think goes through a solver’s mind when she sees that it’s a Chalicea puzzle?

“Chalicea: we can usually manage hers; should be fun.”

Many thanks to Chalicea. The answer to the clue above is TWEET (WEE inside the abbreviation for teetotaller, TT) and you can and should follow Chalicea’s verbal and visual responses to Listener puzzles at Listen With Others.

Inaccurate forecasts, misleading football and an accidental Batman obituary in the pick of the best of the broadsheets’ cryptic clues

The news in clues

The pollsters may as well have used hepatoscopy. How did the crossword setters do? Sylvanus recalled the far-off days ...

21ac Those standing hope it will be comfortable for them (8)

... of a working MAJORITY; in another cryptic definition, Samuel offered some straightforward guidance for what to do ...

11d One’s cross to be penned in here (7,5)

... in the POLLING BOOTH; as far as I can see, the only actual prediction was from KCit ...

7ac Share vote (Labour’s third, out of it) (5)

[ synonym for ‘vote’ without (‘out of it’) the third letter of LABOUR ]

[ BALLOT without B ]

... in a psephologically inaccurate but still persuasive clue for BALLOT. So now cryptic setters must come to terms with the imminent loss of a prime minister whose surname, even more than BROWN, could be mistaken for non-prime ministerial things. From an auxiliary verb to a popular month, MAY was a gift for misdirection. Can the same be said of RUDD or FALLON? Of course not.

What setters need, looking across the parties, is one of the EAGLEs, Angela or Maria (both L) or perhaps Mhairi BLACK (SNP), Neil (SNP) or James (C) GRAY, Lyn (L), Nick (L) or Alan BROWN (SNP), or Chris (C), Kate (L) or Damian GREEN (C). Failing that, we would surely all be happy to see Prime Minister Kirstene HAIR. And do feel free to share your own favourite ambiguous MPs, from Liz TWIST to Tracey CROUCH below.

Because they can

We do not expect hidden messages in the Times crossword, aside perhaps from a significant birthday for whoever the current monarch might be, or some equally stately anniversary. So this was quite a surprise ...

... and inadvertently poignant, published exactly one week before the death of Adam West. The puzzle also featured that rara avis, the “prime numbers” clue:

17ac Manage surety in prime locations in dread (5)

Here we look at the letters of MANAGESURETY and take the second, third, fifth, seventh and eleventh (2, 3, 5, 7 and 11 being the first prime numbers) for the answer ANGST. This is a device seen far more often in the competition run at these pages – and is the topic of our next challenge. Reader, how would you clue PRIME?

Clueing competition

Many thanks for your clues for the new variant NUCULAR. I understood some solvers’ incredulity that this spelling should appear in, say, the Oxford English Dictionary – and the decision on the part of many to help the solver by alerting them to its quirkiness, nicely executed in GappyTooth’s “Popular science revision that should otherwise have been potentially unclear”.

The runners-up are Schroduck’s “Simply turning up in radium, lutetium, carbon, uranium, nitrogen?” and Obi23’s “Not Authorised Version of avuncular, bumbling Bush’s bomb?”; the winner is Catarella’s ingenious “Like a crazy president’s bomb, explosive supercritical plutonium should be separated from politics (ie Trump)”.

Kludos again to Catarella; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the broadsheet cryptics below.

Clue of the fortnight

And thanks to solver Tony Collman for nominating this Times clue ...

26ac Man United soon to control opening of game, sweeper claims (10)

[ synonym for ‘control’ + first letter (‘opening’) of GAME, both contained in synonym for ‘sweeper’ ]

[ RIDE + G, both inside BROOM ]

... with a consistent surface that consistently misdirects us from spotting the BRIDEGROOM. Score!

~_~

The latest in our series where we turn the tables on the torturers. Under the spotlight this time is Dave Warder, AKA Screw

Screw had his first Guardian cryptic published in March 2015. At the time, I wrote: “Keener readers might have noticed Donk in the comments hereabouts, as well as in the featured clues”, alluding to his Independent puzzles.



Since then, he has established an economical, shrewd and occasionally cheeky style – so let’s meet the setter. (And if you are one of those solvers who prefers not to know what the setters look like, avert your eyes before the image at the end.)

When and where do you create your puzzles?



I tend to write either at the dining table or at a desk in our spare room. But when inspiration strikes, I’ve always got a pen and notebook handy. Driving through Dorset recently, we came across Chideock, which showed some promise for an insertion.

And when did you get the crossword bug?

Probably when I started going on holiday more regularly. I remember scanning clues occasionally when I was younger, looking for anagrams – but it only became a serious hobby in my 20s. After a few years of solving, I decided to try my hand at compiling. I haven’t revisited my first efforts for a long time and I’m not sure I really want to. I learned a lot from various blogs, and especially Dean Mayer’s DIY:COW clue-writing contests.

How did you choose your pseudonyms?

Donk is a nickname from an old pub quiz team, and I use Screw because (a) my surname’s Warder; (b) it splits into S (second) + CREW (to represent joining a second paper) and (c) the opportunities for risque wordplay.

What’s your favourite of your own clues or puzzles?

Quite a few of my early puzzles had something extra going on in them, including one with identical clues for pairs of across lights, a May Day effort with all across clues starting “I may ... ”, a puzzle using the BBC Radio 4 sitcom Cabin Pressure as its theme (the highlighted solution of which was sent to me by the show’s writer, John Finnemore) and one that included a football pitch.

One of my favourite clues from that was:

14/22ac Part of pitch covered by Mido? (6,6)

I also quite like:

Ahem. We’ll give the answers at the bottom. Which other setters do you admire?

It’s very difficult to pick out individuals from the vast array of talent in the crossword world.

But I would like to take this opportunity to thank my test solver, Sue, whose patience and guidance have been invaluable. She has put up with some very iffy ideas and always pointed me in the right direction.

What makes a successful clue?

This is tricky to answer, as solvers have very different opinions regarding what works for them. I try to concentrate on brevity, wit and an accurate definition. It’s always a pleasure to use a simple device – such as a hidden word – in a way that takes an age to discover and leaves the solver wondering how they didn’t see it straight away.

... and what makes an unsuccessful clue?

A sense of disappointment on solving.

How do you imagine a solver of your crosswords?

Someone excited to find new ways of breaking words down and who delights in the complexity of the English language. I’m always on the lookout for any words that change part of speech between the surface reading and the cryptic reading: something that can, for example, work as a verb in the surface but as an adjective when it comes to the cryptic instructions. Solvers of my puzzles probably have to put up with a fair amount of football, slang and rudeness, too.

Paper or screen?

Paper, usually on the commute.

Pencil or pen?

Pen. I like to live dangerously.

What advice would you give to an aspiring setter?

Don’t force anything. If a grid fill is becoming a chore, with limited obvious cluing possibilities, don’t be afraid to rework it. And if a clue is becoming strained by one idea, try a different approach.

How do people respond when you tell them you’re a crossword setter?

Surprise, mainly. I’m not particularly eloquent, I don’t have an enormous vocabulary and I come from a mathematical background – not the usual qualifications for a setter. Sadly, the most common response is a refusal to believe they could solve cryptics. It takes a bit of time and commitment to understand what is going on in the clues, but it’s hugely rewarding when you can polish off a hard one.

Is a propensity to play games with words ever a nuisance to yourself or others?



My poor fiancee tolerates my gibberish every day. She always puts me right with a “They won’t let you print that!” (see previous answer). She’s become a good solver now, too.

What do you think goes through a solver’s mind when she sees that it’s a Screw puzzle?

Anything apart from dread, hopefully. An expectation of entertainment, frustration, clarity, success and a few giggles along the way is my target.

And what’s the future for cryptic crosswords?

There seems to be a new generation of younger setters coming through, so I certainly see a bright future for cryptics. As technologies change, the cryptic world will have to keep up to stay relevant.

Anything else before we go?

A big thank you to solvers for keeping cryptics alive. If you get half the pleasure from solving my puzzles, as I do setting them for you, the job’s a good ’un.

Alan Connor finds record-breaking rudeness and corporate evasion in his pick of the week's best – and most optimally leveraged – cryptic clues

The news in clues

When Nigel Farage responded to Ken Clarke's "clowns" comment by recalling the justice minister's work in saving the single currency, Clarke may have smiled ruefully at the clue in Monday's Times...

19ac Regret backing old currency (4)

...for EURO. Meanwhile, Gordius showed that he has not forgotten about...

2d Saying "beef", say, can be supporting timber (8)

....that tasty bute in supermarkets' corned beef in his clue for the carpenter's stand, the SAWHORSE. (A "saw" as in a saying, particularly a hackneyed one, shares a background with communicative words such as "saga" and "say".)

Blue clues

Donk made a bold claim in Wednesday's Independent in his clue...

26ac I may break record for sauciness (3)



...for LIP, then backed it up in another of his across clues (all of which began "I may..."), with a lewd surface reading...

29ac I may roger gorgeous nurses from behind (7)

...as Donk claims for the nonce that he is called GREGORY. The bar is set.

Latter patter

The corporate jargon recently described by Steven Poole in these pages was the subject of a clue in Tuesday's Times:

7d Get high after handling small bull? (10-5)

The definition for MANAGEMENT-SPEAK was "bull", which I've tended to presume is a shortened form of a longer, ruder term. It turns out that the eight-letter word is probably of 20th-century vintage, though, with "bull" stretching back to the 17th; there are also French and Icelandic words "boul" and "bull" with similar senses, so there's no hint of smut in the clue.

My favourite piece of management speak was related by Rob Long in his KCRW show Martini Shot, when he had been chatting with a business-world pal who told him:

You know how in business everyone always uses that stupid Chinese quote, you know: the word for 'crisis' is the same as the word for 'opportunity'? Well in our company we're so into this Six Sigma stuff, we're so deep into the lingo, that the word 'opportunity' is actually a bad word. I mean, it's supposed to be a good thing, right? But because we're not really allowed to tear down an idea, you know, we're encouraged to be solutions-based, people have just decided to use that word in another way. So in meetings they'll say after a presentation, 'Um, I'm sensing there are a lot of opportunities here', and they won't mean 'opportunities', they'll mean, 'let's not do this, let's do whatever we can to avoid any "opportunities"', and sometimes a meeting will be called to 'address' 'opportunities' in a certain plan and by 'address' they mean 'kill'. And what's worse, my friend said, is that nobody thinks this is funny.

The other reason to beware "opportunities" in a corporate context is that "opportunities" are what you may be invited to pursue outside your workplace when you're no longer welcome there. You know, when your employer has decided that fewer stakeholders will be wearing more hats as they reallocate human resources.

It would liven up The Apprentice if one week it ended with Lord Sugar pointing and announcing "You're reduced" or similar. In that vein is this week's clueing challenge: reader, how would you clue RIGHTSIZING?

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues for GEEK CHIC. The two-word phrase lent itself to some impressively terse clues, among them jonemm's "Smarty pants?"; andyknott's "iTie?"; TKHawkey's "Anorak's anorak?" and wellywearer2's "Square wear".

The runners-up are JollySwagman's indirect use of a Greek chick in "Cleopatra lost two kings. Looks freaky!" and yungylek's intriguing surface "Having given electric company bad check, I look like a dweeb"; the winner is the bleeding-edge imagery of ID5180378's "Start with Google eyeglasses. Everyone knows computer hardware is cool!". Kudos to '518 – please leave this week's entries and your pick of the broadsheet cryptics below.

Clue of the week

An apparently financial tale from Elgar in the Telegraph Toughie...

11/12ac What may hold up top solver's heading straight at PEP, unfortunately (9,5)

...turned out to be two routes to a SPAGHETTI STRAP. Delizioso!

Alan Connor finds undying poetry and evasive hobbits in his pick of the best cryptic clues

The news in clues

As we know from our encounter with him here, Gaff is a specialist in anniversary puzzles – and a dab hand at very long anagrams, the one which appeared to be about the royal wedding being a personal favourite.

So in a FT prize puzzle, for which the answer appears today, it was no surprise to see one of those long clues that takes up a quarter of the column. First, you had to solve this one ...

7d/22d Writer of plays last Monday having second thoughts (5,6)

[ anagram (“plays”) of “last Monday” and the second letter of “thoughts”]

... for DYLAN THOMAS and then you could get stuck into the one that made up nine separate entries in the grid:

19d/9ac/12ac/17d/15ac/15ac/8d/27ac/16ac Desperately, I got to get high and tight – going to arrange aged sonnet to fight lonely death of 7, 22 (2,3,2,6,4,4,9,4,4,7,3,5,2,3,5) [ anagram (“desperately”) of “I got to get high and tight going to arrange aged sonnet to fight lonely death”]

Such a short definition (“of Dylan Thomas”) and such a long answer. Two lines from the villanelle in question: DO NOT GO GENTLE INTO THAT GOOD NIGHT / RAGE, RAGE AGAINST THE DYING OF THE LIGHT. And such fun to see that the repeated reference to 15 across in the clue is not a mistake, but mere economy in including that repeated RAGE. The Long Anagram is tricky to pull off; the Long Apposite Anagram is something to treasure.

Latter patter

Some audacious clueing from Donk in the Independent. I was tickled by this clue ...

25ac Overseas delivery secured by rubber band (6,9) [ synonym for “condom” + name of a music group ]

... for JOHNNY FOREIGNER. The Oxford Dictionary of Modern Slang tantalises by noting that the phrase was “first recorded in 1990 but in use earlier”. Much earlier, my instinct says.

Happily, we don’t have to rely on my instinct: the man who knows is Eric Partridge, who reckons the whole JOHNNY SQUAREHEAD, JOHNNY CRAPAUD, JOHNNY GURK thing began with JOHNNY TURK. Until recently, I might have said that JOHNNY FOREIGNER is used predominantly with an attempt at irony, possibly with a General Melchett inflection, but since politicians from apparently serious parties have been tossing around phrases such as “bongo-bongo land”, I’m not so sure.

We’ve looked before at the various Billys of slang and there are at least as many Johnnys: the startling JOHNNYBAIT (“a sexually attractive girl”, says Partridge), the rhyming-slang JOHNNY CASH (“an act of urination”) and the nineteenth-century American subject of our next challenge. Reader, how would you clue JOHNNY-COME-LATELY?

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues for PHANTASMAGORIA. There were plenty of seasonally spooky surfaces, such as alberyalbery’s “Panorama – a sight arising from magic lantern show” and ID2155366’s “a”-embracing “Hallowe’en hordes stomp in – Aaaargh! Spooky”, though jimdubya’s “Igor’s panama hat? Absurd! A bizarre sight!” and robinjohnson’s evocation of a hotel lounge “Graham’s at piano, playing a haunting medley” were delightfully unexpected.

And the mathematics was pleasingly misleading in harlobarlo’s “Pythagoras’ mania: work out missing variable for set of imaginary shapes” and steveran’s

“Shifting figures confuse a maths pro again”.

I was intrigued by artemiswolf’s “Phi? Santa is gone ... Zero’s right in jumpy Sigma’s grasp! A staged supernatural horror” without having identified the “puzzle/virtual-novel video game with a twinge of horror” to which the clue apparently alludes.

The runners-up are HipsterPriest’s anthropological-sounding “Form of paganism Torah accepts, albeit initially, as a creation of fantasy” and Truth101’s Sleeper-like “Treating pain with ‘orgasm hat’ is an unusual sight”; the winner is Middlebro for recalling the old days of indicated anagrams, and indeed for using “anagram” as part of an anagram in “Frightening images formed when I shot Pa (anagram)”.

Kudos to Middlebro; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the broadsheet cryptics below.

Clue of the Fortnight

Though I still haven’t read the Tolkien breezeblock (I got sidelined by a companion volume about runes), I’ve picked up enough to identify the monster that Imogen was asking for in this clue ...

22d He held the greatest ring not to be enough (5) [opposite of “to” + word meaning “to be enough”]

... for FRODO, with the devious-but-fair wordplay proving more of a challenge than a book I hadn’t read. Almién!

Alan Connor finds deliberate misspellings and trips to the loo in his pick of the week's best - and most presidential - cryptic clues

The news in clues

In Tuesday's Independent, new setter Alchemi offered surely one of the deftest acrostics of the Leveson era ...

25ac Official report into governance - at Murdoch's insistence - leads to paper folding (7)

... with the initial letters spelling ORIGAMI. Alchemi also included all four candidates on the tickets of last week's US election. Each of the would-be presidents showed up in other contexts: a Telegraph clue was phrased as the question put to America ...

7d Incumbent Obama to lose power? (8)

... where you remove the P of PRESIDENT for RESIDENT, while Gordius was irresistibly misleading, indicating not Mitt ...

17d Dawn let loose about Romney? (7)

... but the WETLAND and possible toxic dump and/or flightpath victim Romney Marshes.

Blue clues

A lavatorial mini theme in the Guardian this week. Philistine succinctly evoked an unpalatable image ...

25ac Trouble in the loo (13)

... with no need at all to apologise for the INCONVENIENCE, while Araucaria used an image of a private place ...

2d One's own loo in which to return paper used (7,8)

... to lead you to PRIVATE PROPERTY.

Meanwhile over at the Independent prize puzzle, another newer setter, Donk ...

14ac He is one that could be embarrassing for American (3)

... gave a cryptic definition via the chemical symbol He and a straight borborygmic definition of GAS.

Latter patter

Tuesday's Telegraph ...

14d Quantity of drink, low in calories, divided by right (5)

... got us to LITRE via LITE, a postpositive term for a product that has less of what you actually want: in food, sugar; in software, functionality; in politics, policy. Or, perhaps, one that appears to have: cynical minds might suspect that it's easier to suggest something is LITE in trans fats than it is to prove that it's LIGHT in them.

Oxford's earliest citation of this kind of LITE is a 1954 Los Angeles Times advert for the "Clerk-lite steno" typing machine, though I wonder whether the sense might have been inspired by the Prest-O-Lite gas tank, as featured in a 1911 ad in Popular Mechanics - what do you reckon?

A more recent vogue for sort-of phonetical branding is the dropping of a vowel to make a domain name: Flickr, Tumblr and so on. Our cluing challenge this week is a name that's been around so long it's stopped seeming weird: reader, how would you clue TOYS R US - or, if you must, TOYS Я US? And do you have any other favourite examples of inventive branding - or, despite being fans of wordplay, your least favourite?

Cluing competition

Thanks for your clues for TWITTERATI. Well done especially to anyone who managed to resist the wordplay used by the prime minister, although there were some charming surfaces.

TWITTERATI prompted some creative uses of microblogging vocabulary, my favourites being the definition in JollySwagman's "Fool accepting race against time with current trendsetters" and the hashtag preceding it in Qfwfq73's "MRT @tiewit #elite".

Among many apposite surface readings, especially enjoyable were harlobarlo's "Ultimately, best few mini-text-proficient people offer drama; combat ennui" and Insidian's "Clique of limited character?"

The runner-up is andyknott's withering acrostic "Premier tweeters who imagine that their epigrammatic releases are terribly interesting" and the winner is phitonelly's "Ladies, gathering at times in flamboyant attire, love to share their thoughts with the world". Kudos to Phi. Please leave this week's entries and your pick of the broadsheet cryptics below.

Clue of the Week

As nominated by reader gleety, Klingsor gave a beautifully terse clue in an Independent puzzle ...

2d One demands Guinness? (7)

... for EXACTOR. Obi-Wantastic.

Peculiar spellings take over from more sensible originals, and William Hague finds a glamorous gal pal in the best of the broadsheets’ cryptic clues

The news in clues

A fortnight ago, we looked at Claymore’s splendid clue for a timely phrase; now it’s Knut’s turn, with a surface suggesting a different polity ...

18ac Political gambit gets Latinos furious with Pence (4,8)

[ anagram (‘furious’) of LATINOS and (‘with’) PENCE ]

... but the definition referring to the same SNAP ELECTION. If you missed that puzzle, it’s “ram-packed” with topicality and you should solve it straight away. In the following day’s Independent, Dutch gave his or her take on the cause and likely effects of that snap election, in a pithy clue ...

33ac May essentially divides Britain with pet project (4)

[ middle letter (‘essentially’) of MAY, in between (‘divides’) abbrev. for ‘Britain’ and synonym for ‘with’ ]

[ A, in between B and BY ]

... for BABY. And a couple of days and/or a generation later, Giovanni (known locally as Pasquale) seemed to afford us a peek behind the scenes at the Three Brexiteers in his clue ...

6d Men in leadership roles could make Theresa gruff, I fancy (6,7)

[ anagram (‘fancy’) of THERESA GRUFF I ]

... for FATHER FIGURES.

Latter patter

A couple of thoughts dogged me as I finished a recent Friday Independent puzzle, set as it so often is by Phi. Firstly, why didn’t I know that a reveller might be described as a ROVER? And why was the software not showing that I had completed my mission?

The answers were (a) that a reveller simply is not a ROVER and so (b) I had not completed my mission. The clue in question was this:

15d Outgoing partygoer taken in by wayward text (9)

[ synonym for ‘partygoer’ inside anagram (‘wayward’) of TEXT ]

[ RAVER inside EXTT ]

Phi’s hidden theme, it turned out, is words for which alternative spellings are knocking about. So why was I so sure of my “extrovert” spelling that I was willing to overlook that the reveller might be a RAVER? Well, it’s the version I most often see. But it’s not the one used by Jung, who pretty much invented this sense of the word and wrote “der extravertierte Typus dagegen fühlt sich, indem er handelt, ins Objekt ein.” Quite.

On reflection, “extra-” is a pretty common prefix, certainly more so than “extro-”, and perhaps that was what Jung had in mind when he apparently told a correspondent that EXTROVERT is bad Latin. That exchange is described by psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman, who reckons that the O version first appeared in a 1918 paper in the American Journal of Psychology and stuck around long enough to take over as the most common spelling, however bad its Latin. Hence Beet in the same paper a few days later:

19ac Old car entered into races and not withdrawn (9)

[ prefix denoting ‘old’, then car marque inside abbrev. for specific races ]

[ EX, then ROVER inside TT ]

Meanwhile Phi also included MINUSCULE (threatened by the upstart MINISCULE), ARTEFACT (see ARTIFACT) and others which he discusses in a comment at solvers’ blog Fifteen Squared.



Our next challenge is of the same stripe. It started as a non-standard pronunciation of “nuclear”, uttered so many times that dictionaries began to list it as a variant pronunciation, and now even as a variant spelling. Reader, how would you clue NUCULAR?

Cluing competition

Thanks for your clues to BHANG. There were some lovely swerves away from narcotic surfaces, like DameSweeneyEggblast’s Baedekerish “Stay near Bangalore initially for recreation in India”, JollySwagman’s “British humour’s antiquated principally – no good – but this might make you giggle” and Encota’s “Host’s top hit – Eats, Shoots and Leaves – intoxicating”.

The runners-up – Lizard’s “Drug could be ‘smack’, heroin being injected” and Alberyalbery’s “A type of drug – GHB with an awful mixture” – are both bang-on-topic and dimly ominous; the winner is Catarella’s sneaky “Intoxicant is the root of brewer’s droop”.

Kludos to Catarella; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the broadsheet cryptics below.

Clue of the Fortnight

Here’s another clue from the Beet puzzle mentioned above ...

11ac Hague regularly pursuing Oscar-winning actress, one half of team Brangelina? (11)

[ every other letter (‘regularly’) of HAGUE, after (‘pursuing’) surname of Oscar-winning actress, and half of the letters of TEAM ]

[ AU, after (Natalie) PORTMAN + TE ]

... which directed the solver away from PORTMANTEAU for a while by bringing to mind one of 2014’s unlikely friendships.

A word the Oxford dictionary dislikes, plus the best of the rest of the recent cryptic clues

The news in clues

Bravo to Claymore (known elsewhere as eXternal) in the National for this ingenious cluing …

1ac Sturgeon’s party welcoming a Con elite running early vote (4,7)

[ abbrev. for Sturgeon’s party, containing (‘welcoming’) A (‘a’), then

anagram (‘running’) of CONELITE ]

[ SNP containing A, then anagram of CONELITE ]

… of SNAP ELECTION, counterpointed by Hectence’s evocation …

13ac Demand English vote on legislation (5)

[ abbrev. for ‘English’ + symbol used to cast vote, then (‘on’) synonym for ‘legislation’ ]

[ E + X + ACT ]

… for EXACT in the quiptic, the Guardian’s stepping stone for those wanting to cross from the quick to the cryptic braes.

Cluing coincidence

On the same day last week, Vigo in the Independent asked for …

14ac Old Major’s decoration embroidered initially onto uniform in a range of colours (9)

[ first letter (‘initially’) of EMBROIDERED, then (‘onto’) letter represented by ‘uniform’ contained by (‘in’) word describing ‘a range of colours’ ]

[ E, then U inside PALETTE ]

… one EPAULETTE, just as an anonymous Times setter …

13ac Clothing ornament English landlord briefly keeps in French city? (9)

[ abbrev. for ‘English’ and synonym for ‘landlord’ missing its last letter (‘briefly’), both containing (‘keeps in’) the capital of Pyrénées-Atlantiques ]

[ E + LETTER minus its R, both containing PAU ]

… was demanding the other. Well, they are supposed to come in pairs, even for Nelson.

EPAULETTE is one of those rare words for which the Oxford English Dictionary expresses an opinion; in this case, preferring an anglicised version (EPAULET), though in the weary knowledge that the appropriately frillier spelling is not going anywhere.

Likewise, Oxford prefers AY to AYE, dɪˈmeɪn to dɪˈmiːn when it comes to pronouncing DEMESNE … and the subject of our next challenge to BANG. I sympathise, if only for the idiosyncratic reason that BANG means plenty already. So, reader: how would you clue BHANG? And do you agree on EPAULET and AY?

Cluing competition

Thank you for your clues for JAPE. I enjoyed all the little depictions of pranks and wheezes, from Harlobarlo’s “First person from France to traverse Alps? Oddly, it’s a hoax” to JollySwagman’s “Knave’s activity on April 1”. Lizard tickled my topical bone with “Juncker audaciously pooh-poohs English – first of those to mock”, while Alberyalbery, perhaps or perhaps not knowing my culinary predilections, was equally topical in “Mock Jersey asparagus provides excellent starters”.

The runners-up are terse DameSweeneyEggblast’s “Juliet, copy Josh” and Catarella’s sadly plausible “Lark Ascending recording with banjo? Oddly non-existent”; the winner is ID2155366’s strangely ominous “Fun and games following Bonn Agreement”.

Kludos to our regrettably anonymous winner; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the broadsheet cryptics below.

Clue of the fortnight

Don’t let the salacious imagery of Micawber’s Telegraph Toughie clue …

1ac After wine, Margaret’s one often found pinning a guy down (4,3)

[ a Spanish wine, followed by (‘after’) abbrev. for ‘Margaret’ ]



… for TENT PEG distract you from the innocent ingenuity of the definition. And if you have any more thoughts on the great WHITE KNIGHT debate, please share them below before we return to the topic.

~_~

During our competition to clue WHITE KNIGHT, solver Catarella paused for a spot of philosophy:

I wonder if all the clues that are giving some sort of synonym for a chess piece are quite playing fair (including my own). Obviously, it’s a chess piece, but it wouldn’t be in a crossword because it’s a chess piece. If I solved a puzzle and found black pawn to be one of the solutions I’d feel a bit miffed.

Thank you for the excellent discussion that has since ensued. First of all, an easy question which Catarella didn’t actually ask: should every entry in a cryptic crossword be found in a dictionary? The easy answer is given by such recent Guardian clues as those for OTHELLO, JOHN LEWIS and SHERGAR.

These samples might, of course, all be found in other reference works. And the same goes for an entry from a puzzle recalled by Schroduck: the NINE OF DIAMONDS; here it is, albeit not as a headword phrase, in Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable ...

... which answers the question of whether the nine of diamonds is, to use the terminology that arrived in our discussion with alacrity, “a thing”.

The nine of diamonds has lore and a nickname; it (like the white knight) is certainly “a thing” in a way that a black pawn almost certainly is not. I happily acknowledge that specifying what kind of thing “a thing” is, has eluded minds even greater than ours for many centuries, though Paul Taylor does as good a job as anyone in his distinction between “ham sandwich” (a thing) and “tasty sandwich” (not).



Henri Picciotto, setter for The Nation, joined in to suggest a way of approaching the issue when in the thick of compiling. In a post for that paper, he and co-setter Joshua Kosman explain:

Our main criterion is that we like our entries to have ‘dictionary nature.’ A word or phrase has dictionary nature if it appears in a dictionary, if it would appear in a theoretical, large-enough dictionary, or if it appears or would appear in a plausible list.

I enthusiastically recommend the whole piece, especially for the distinctions between UNDERCLUE, UNDERAPPLE and OVERBREAD – and for moving things to matters of judgment. Judgment, indeed, is a friend to setter and editor when considering pieces of language which would struggle to appear in almost any reference work: Jolly Swagman gives the real-world example of ALL OUR OPERATORS ARE BUSY PLEASE HOLD. That’s “real-world” in the senses both that it appeared in a Guardian puzzle, and that it’s a phrase which the setter judged likely to have assailed the actual ears of most solvers; nowadays UNEXPECTED ITEM IN BAGGING AREA would do the same job.

Once such an entry passes muster, the trickier half of the clue is surely the definition. Or, to return to the question that Catarella actually did ask: should a setter think about doing better than using, say, “a chess piece” for the definition part of a clue to WHITE KNIGHT – especially when, in this case, there exist all those metaphorical meanings of WHITE KNIGHT which helped to make it “a thing”?

As a solver, I tend to find definitions become fairer as they become less generic; I would also always find a definition along the lines of “Curse of Scotland” more fun and interesting than, say, “card”. And fun and fairness are the qualities I prize most in a puzzle.

~_~

Our most recent cluing competition has raised a fascinating issue of what words can properly be defined in cryptic clues. BLACK PAWN? How about WHITE KNIGHT?

The news in clues

It’s in the nature of a snap election, I suppose, that we shouldn’t expect to have yet seen any special puzzles themed around 8 June. But we shall keep an eye here on how Westminster is portrayed in crosswording. So far, the Conservatives have been the most visible, although not always in a flattering light. I’m thinking of clues such as Neo’s in the Financial Times ...

25ac Tory backed with nothing offers negative response (2,3,2)

[ reversal (‘backed’) of an abbrev. for ‘Tory’, then synonym for ‘with’ + letter resembling ‘nothing’ ]

[ reversal of CON, then AND + O ]

... for NO CAN DO. Also, see Armonie’s pair from the previous day ...



9ac Going round to corrupt a politician (8)

[ synonym for ‘to corrupt’ + example of ‘a politician’ ]

[ ROT + A TORY ]

18d Committed to the party but unswervingly offensive (4-4)

[ synonyms for ‘unswervingly’ and ‘offensive’ ]

[ TRUE + BLUE ]

... for ROTATORY and TRUE BLUE, and Hoskins’ ...

13d Conservative down, worried about key deadline? (7,4)

[ abbrev. for ‘Conservative’ + synonym for ‘down’ + synonym for ‘worried’, all surrounding (‘about’) a musical key ]

[ C + LOSING + ATE, all surrounding D ]

... for CLOSING DATE (and here’s the electoral register). Some balance is offered by the Sunday Telegraph setter’s seemingly loyal clue ...

18ac Interpret as accurate when introduced by Tories (8)

[ synonym for ‘accurate’ preceded by (‘when introduced by’) abbrev. for ‘Tories’ ]

[ TRUE preceded by CONS ]

... for CONSTRUE. If you see anything similar in the weeks to come, do let me know below.



Latter patter

Here at crossword blog, we celebrate coincidences in cluing, especially when they highlight different routes to a single destination. Here are Serpent and Jambazi (read our Q&A here) ...

10ac Complex situation doesn’t require judge sitting in court (9)

[ synonym for ‘situation’ without (‘doesn’t require’) abbrev. for ‘judge’, then synonym for ‘sitting in court’ ]

[ JOB without J, then SESSION ]

15d Clinics supporting old boy with fetishes (10)

[ synonym for ‘clinics’ under (‘supporting’) abbrev. for ‘old boy’ ]

[ SESSIONS under OB ]

... hot on each other’s heels with OBSESSION and OBSESSIONS.

The story of OBSESSION is a happy one: it changed meaning from siege to possession by spirits – but then, seemingly and suddenly, was of no use to man or beast after about 1700. And yet it reappeared in the mid-19th century, almost as if it had never been away, promptly picked up new psychoanalytic connotations alluded to in the clues above and is now in ruder health than it has ever been.

Other words that we’ve declared null then revived include VERITABLE (which appeared and reappeared around the same time as OBSESSION), CHILL (which went into some kind of hibernation between around 1400 and 1600) and the subject of our next challenge.

Chaucer used it freely to mean jest or joke; respectable writers did the same until the 16th century, when they noticed that unrespectable writers were using it to refer to the act of love. Very soon nobody used it at all. In the 19th century, the harrowing memories of the rude sense had faded and it was back with its old innocent meaning. So, reader: how would you clue JAPE?

Call to action

Before we get to the previous competition, solver Catarella raises a deep issue with regard to the answer, WHITE KNIGHT:

I wonder if all the clues that are giving some sort of synonym for a chess piece are quite playing fair (including my own). Obviously, it’s a chess piece, but it wouldn’t be in a crossword because it’s a chess piece. If I solved a puzzle and found black pawn to be one of the solutions I’d feel a bit miffed.

We should discuss this in more detail. Before we do, I’ll be trying to remember examples of possibly relevant answers: word strings that wouldn’t be in any dictionary, say, and where lines can be drawn. I would be indebted if you did the same.

Cluing competition

And so now thank you for your clues to WHITE KNIGHT. Chrisbeee spotted a very apposite anagram and put it to elegant use in “Piece replaced with the king?”, which is in no way to denigrate the other clues using the same fodder. Of the unexpected surfaces, I especially enjoyed Middlebro’s “Sir David Jason?” and DameSweeneyEggblast’s “‘With milk, sir?’ ‘Champion.’”

The runners-up are Lizard’s bridging “Playing with the king, one may make counter bid” and Ousgg’s chessy “May come to your aid by opening 3a”; the winner is TonyCollman’s charmingly rambling “Company’s benefactor may be one: that’s ‘be one announced for place on board’, to start with”.

Kludos to Tony; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the broadsheet cryptics below.

Clue of the fortnight

A wholly plausible surface from Brendan ...

28d People care when the odds are switched (4)

[ CARE, with its first and third (odd) letters switched ]

... which waylays you while you consider that those people are betting on, if not one of these elections, possibly some kind of RACE.

Ever wondered what goes through a cryptic compiler’s mind? Paul recalls a very special setting session ...

The setter Paul recently ran the London marathon in memory of his brother (after whom he took his nom de guerre) and to raise money for Sense. He also set a cryptic puzzle along the way. At the beginning of each mile, a volunteer showed him a sign with one of 26 clues which had been assembled into a grid by Paul’s setting colleague Imogen. I asked Paul if he could remember how each clue came to him. (The answer in each heading links directly to the clue.)

Mile 1 (location: Greenwich; sign-holder: Anna McGrail): SET OFF

Immediately, I knew this would be tough: I couldn’t think of a decent synonym. I now realise I could have used TOFF from the London area as SE TOFF.

Mile 2 (Charlton Park Road; Ali Budun): INFANTRYMAN

Good grief, I think I swore at Ali on the way past. Realised I had to define IN, FAN, TRY and MAN. Panic.

Mile 3 (Woolwich Arsenal; James Harris): AT BEST

Disappointed not to have come up with better idea for “B”. I was only spending about 30 seconds a clue on thinking. It shows.

Mile 4 (Woolwich Dockyard; Sarah Harris): NINE-TO-FIVE

Thankfully, I had clued this before. With a stunning lack of integrity, I stole my own clue. Onward.

Mile 5 (Charlton; my sister Louise): BARBARIC

How cruelly apt. And likely to disempower other runners. I yelled at her to take the clue down.

Mile 6 (Greenwich Park; Mark Vickers): TOILETRY

Looking back, I LET in TORY is a better structure, but I used “John” for “toilet”.

Mile 7 (Cutty Sark; Jenny Glanville): A BONE TO PICK

Darn it, couldn’t see Jenny, so missed word. After texting her, I clued it at end of race while still tired, for authenticity.

Mile 8 (Deptford; Jill Cramphorn): ECLAIR

Finally, a clue I like! Seemed like a partial anagram. Saw “I race” and then the L became capital in London.

Mile 9 (Surrey Quays; Kate Percival): TWITCH

Toyed with TWIT+CH, T+WITCH and W in TITCH ... turning into slowest marathon ever.

Mile 10 (Salter Road; Vincent Clohessy): SCRATCHPAD

Vincent was the best man at my wedding. Hadn’t seen him for a while, so it was lovely to catch up with the following exchange: “Scratchpad! Scratchpad!” “What the heck’s that?” “Dunno!” “OK, thanks, bye!”

Mile 11 (Rotherhithe station; Cedric Spiller): CONCUR

All I can think of is “Agree with blue dog”. Mile 11, and I have reverted to amateur status.

Mile 12 (Bermondsey; Maria Hatter): AIRTIGHT

Struggle with synonym over about a quarter of the mile.

Mile 13 (Tower Bridge; my niece Felicity Hayes): SHELVE

Toyed with a non-PC idea for SHE-LOVE (minus the O) for a while.

Mile 14 (Limehouse; Olivia Mankowitz): CARDIGAN

So sorry. Stole this one from myself again. Needed to give my brain a break.

Mile 15 (Westferry; May Tong): ACCURATE

These are the tough miles. Couldn’t see May, sadly. Again wrote post-race.

Mile 16 (Westferry Road; Lesley Warner): BALLAD

All bad (anagram)?

Mile 17 (East Ferry Road; Peter Warner): RESITE

What? Played with anagram. Nope. Unfortunately, the first idea I think of is now becoming the clue. Tried hiding it backwards in a phrase and gave up quickly.

Mile 18 (Heron Quays; Claude Cheta): BEACON

Imogen, I would have loved some more anagrams, but you did a sterling job in finding words that were often pertinent, and almost always (!) clue-able under the circumstances.

Mile 19 (Canada Square; Liza Tong): SLEDGE

Made a total hash of this. Plant hiding left slipper? What nonsense is this? And later, SLEDGE was changed to PLEDGE by the editor, as we had SLEDGE elsewhere in the same week.

Mile 20 (Poplar High Street; Charles Baines): BANG

Didn’t see Charles at first. He chased me for a full half mile, shouting “Crossword Paul? Bang!”

Mile 21 (Commercial Road; Kay and Rob Reynolds): BILLOWED

Didn’t notice “owed” is a word. Contrived to think it meant “sounded in pain”.

Mile 22 (Shadwell; Warren Hatter): MODERN

A Brighton and Hove Albion fan, Warren handed me a flag to carry to the end of the race. I accidentally poked about five fellow runners in the ribs along the remaining few miles. This word proved troublesome. I was sure there was an anagram somewhere. Eventually I saw it, halfway into mile 24.

Mile 23 (Lower Thames Street; Jane Bombane): DETAIL

Relieved to have clued this before. Stole clue for the last time. Crowds amazing down Embankment.

Mile 24 (Blackfriars; Issy Smith): ROOM

Managed a marathon reference in here to avoid the reversal of MOOR, which everyone does.

Mile 25 (Embankment; Dave Moore): HITHER

Approaching this, I could have sworn he was waving the word HITLER. I hadn’t seen Dave for a while, but I was sure he usually voted Lib Dem. Wiped glasses, refocused and wrote clue.

Mile 26 (Birdcage Walk; John Stocker): BOXERS

How appropriate. I felt pants. It was over. I rounded the corner at Buckingham Palace, crossed the line for by far my slowest time (nearly six hours) and shuffled home. Unedited clues sent to Hugh Stephenson. Unedited clues later published: yikes! Thank you so much to all the wonderful 26 who turned up to support, who made marvellous signs, who were patient enough to remain at their mile markers way beyond my over-optimistic split times, and who were able to deal with the bewildered inquiries of other spectators.

And thanks so much also to all those who contributed to Sense UK, in honour of my brother, Paul, who would have been so delighted.

Paul’s fundraising page is at justgiving.com/fundraising/J-Halpern1 and the annotated solution to his puzzle is now available.

In the first of an occasional series, Alan Connor turns the tables on the torturers. Under the spotlight this week is John Halpern, aka Paul

Welcome to a new feature on the Crossword blog, for anyone who's ever paused during a puzzle, peered at the setter's pseudonym and muttered: "Who is this ogre?"

So, are you ready to Meet the setter? I'm going to ask some of the compilers of broadsheet cryptics what makes them tick, what inspires them and where they get off making life difficult for the rest of us.

Some setters, of course, prefer the penumbra of pseudonymity. And I appreciate that some of you may not wish to Meet the setter, just as seeing Archers actors can spoil Ambridge, and just as a friend once implored me to listen to the music of - but never to look at a photograph of - Gomez. If this is the case, please avert your eyes and I'll see you on Monday. But I bet you peek.

Not least because our first guest is a setter who, appropriately enough, says it will be, "amazing for the solvers to finally get to 'meet' their torturers". John Halpern sets for the Guardian three to four times a month as Paul, as Dada once a month in the Telegraph Toughie, as Mudd two or three times a month in the FT and twice a month as one of the Times's anonymous setters.

I think of Paul's as one of the cheekier crosswords - sometimes risqué, bang-up-to-date with its references and often splutter-out-loud funny. It's a treat to have him as the first setter for whom the tables are turned, as I ask the questions.

When did you get the crossword bug?

My mum solved the Times crossword. One day I learned all the answers, then bought another copy of the Times and took it to a Brighton football match. I pulled the paper out five minutes before kick-off and completed the puzzle. I'm surprised no-one beat me up! Around this time - I think I was 20 years old - I began being fascinated in not just the clues, but the extraordinarily mysterious names who created them. It was another couple of years before I set about trying to become a setter.

What's your favourite of your own clues or puzzles?

From Guardian 22,915:

To make cheese, how do you milk a Welsh hedgehog? (10)

Answer: Caerphilly.

Where do you create your puzzles?

Currently in the sitting room at one end of the table, while my wife works at the other. I have a Mac computer, and a pile of dictionaries and a thesaurus around it. Bits of paper on which I've set clues and remnants of clues are strewn across the table. My wife and I try to avoid each other's glances and get our heads down to work; otherwise we'd constantly be off to coffee shops around Brighton. Discipline required! Sometimes when short of inspiration I wander the two minutes down to the coast, and stare at pebbles and waves until the creative juices flow again. Water of the sea aids the flow.

Where do you come up with your best clues?

When surrounded by words: in conversation; from books - but rarely from the telly.

How did you learn to set?

I spent thousands of hours practising alone, then when I thought I was ready, I sent a sample off to Araucaria. He invited me to lunch. The letter is framed and on the wall in our hall.

Do you remember the first clue you solved or wrote?

Solved, no. Wrote for the Guardian:

Name sewn into footballers' underwear (8)

KNICKERS sort of set the tone.

Which other setters do you admire?

Araucaria for his fun, erudition and creativity. Also Brendan and Shed among others. My heroes when I got started were Araucaria, Shed, Enigmatist, Bunthorne, Fawley and Taupi.

What makes a successful clue?

The smile factor.

What makes an unsuccessful clue?

When it's been written to show how clever the setter is.

How did you choose your pseudonyms?

Paul – see my website. In the FT I used to be called Bats after an ex-girlfriend, whose surname was similar. But when we split, my name became Mudd. I always use a four-letter pseudonym. Dada in the Daily Telegraph – anti-war, anti-establishment, and in honour of my late Dad. And Punk in the Independent – the pun k(ing?). Actually, I'm not that great at puns.

Do your pseudonyms have different personalities?

Yes, a balance between house style and your own. The Times is pretty rigorous on what goes in and what doesn't, The Guardian less so. We adapt accordingly, or at least should do for the sake of editors, and more importantly, solvers.

Is it possible to tell which Times puzzles are yours?

Sometimes I get a text from a friend saying "You're in today, aren't you?". They're usually, but not always, right.

How do people respond when you tell them you're a crossword setter?

The usual response is "you must be clever". Little do they know – they haven't seen me try to wire a plug.

What are the tools of your trade?

Chambers Dictionary, Collins Dictionary, Roget, OED, Chambers Crossword Dictionary, Crossword Compiler software.

How do you imagine a solver of your crosswords?

Younger than average, owning a Vespa, cat lover, naughty sense of humour.

How are you as a solver?

I'm a really, really poor solver. I rarely complete a puzzle. I used to solve every day, all the papers, but now generally only do around one puzzle a week.

Paper or screen?

Paper, of course! If newspapers go only digital, we must launch a crossword newspaper.

Your frame of reference tends to be a bit more Kurt Cobain and a bit less WG Grace than others ...

A balance must be struck to encourage new solvers, and to keep those with more experience. I attempt to address that, but we can't please all the people all the time.

One of your grids had a lot of rude words, not as answers, but hidden inside them. Did you get complaints?

No brickbats, only bouquets – thankfully.

What do you do for a living besides writing crosswords?

I'm full-time.

What do you do in your spare time?

Walks along the Sussex coastline, season ticket holder at Brighton & Hove Albion FC (in the north stand with the louts!), Radio 4 listener, running my third London Marathon in April 2012, promoting the cause of the beautiful cryptic crossword, singing in the shower, writing a weekly blog.

Is a propensity to play games with words ever a nuisance to

yourself or others?

My wife is forever being stopped in the street alongside words and asked

to rearrange them. She had trouble forming "gasometer" from "megastore"

the other day, but who wouldn't?!

If you weren't a crossword setter, what would you be?

Unhappy.

What's the future for cryptic crosswords?

More and more people will solve. Teaching aids will become far more accessible and fun than just the thick tomes we have had in the past.

Anything else?

Tell your friends about cryptic crosswords, and teach them. Share the fun! Thank you taking the time to read this, and to solve our puzzles.

Kudos to Paul for being the first setter met - who else would you like to get to know? And what would you like to ask them? Also, if you have any suggestions for Clue of the Week, please nominate them below.

Guardian cryptic crossword setter Paul challenged himself to write one while he ran. Here’s how he did it …

You run the London marathon, you need a gimmick. For the past 22 years I have been writing the Guardian cryptic crossword under the pseudonym Paul, after my late brother, and I had already run four marathons in his memory. I realised there are about 26 clues in a puzzle, and 26 miles to a marathon. Suddenly the idea was there, and I began to regret it immediately.

I asked my crossword-setting colleague Richard Browne, AKA Imogen, to fill a grid with 26 words. Twenty-six crossword-loving volunteers were each allocated a mile, and a word. They were briefed to stand within yards of each milepost holding up their word, yelling “Crossword Paul!” to attract my attention as I passed. I then had until the next milepost to think of a suitable clue.

I also requested that the grid be filled with positive words: “SUFFER”, “PAIN” and, especially, “WALL” were to be avoided.

I am not designed for running; more for pizza and chocolate cake. Training hadn’t gone well, and I was dreading the thought of having to be creative every mile on top of the pain.

Although I practised spotting words while out on training runs, devising clues and recording them on my Apple Watch, there were problems on the day that I hadn’t anticipated. The sweat on the watch meant the touch sensitive screen failed over and over, and finding the “record” and “save” functions while running proved tricky.

But as usual, the London Marathon was a joy. The crowds make it. There’s no cynicism, no sense that the world is teetering on the edge of political, economical and ecological mayhem – all pulling together, moving in the same direction. That is, except for the man ahead of me, running the marathon backwards. I’m not sure if it was more shameful to be beaten by him, or the man carrying a fridge. Fortunately, for those who wish to solve the resulting puzzle, coming Saturday 6 May, the exasperated expletives punctuating my recorded efforts have been removed from the clues.

The latest in our series where we turn the tables on the torturers. Under the spotlight this time is John Dawson, AKA Chifonie

Chifonie has been setting cryptics for the Guardian since 1994; he also sets for the Financial Times as Armonie and has posed fiendish barred-grid challenges as Symphonia. He can be devious in a way that is frequently funny and always fair; for example, the clue “Deer takes one for a ride (4)”. So, let’s meet the setter.

When did you get the crossword bug?

In 1971, I was working in a laboratory in Birmingham and during our tea and lunch breaks, a group collected around a copy of the Telegraph and solved its crossword collectively.

I soon started attempting the Guardian puzzle at home on my own, but the first time I completed it without assistance was while queuing outside the British Museum for three hours to see the Tutankhamun exhibition. That was a red-letter day in more ways than one.

How did you choose your pseudonyms?

Music means a great deal to me and at the time my first puzzles were being published I was listening to a lot of early music in which the hurdy-gurdy is often featured. There are many different names for this instrument and I chose to use three of them, Armonie, Chifonie and Symphonia.

Where do you create your puzzles?

In my living room, switching between an easy chair surrounded by reference books and sitting at my computer accessing its reference works and writing my clues. When the mood takes me, I can look out of the window across the town to Kendal Castle and the fells beyond.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sunrise over Castle Hill, Kendal, as seen from Chifonie’s home. Photograph: John Dawson/lakedistrictwalks.com

That sounds heavenly. What’s your favourite of your own clues or puzzles?

I have to trust other people’s judgment for my best clues. Hugh Stephenson’s favourite is:

Saw dog wearing lead (7)

And David Astle, writer of the book Puzzled, likes:

Fool starts to imagine death is only temporary (5)

The first, I note, is also in the introduction to Chambers Crossword Dictionary. What are the tools of your trade?

I have a great battery of aids, both reference books and computer programs, to help create my puzzles. I use them to help me write better clues rather than save time.

How does setting for the quick differ from an authored puzzle?

For quicks I look for words or phrases that have straightforward definitions. For cryptics I look for words that easily split into components for the cryptic part of the clue.

What makes a successful clue?

One that puzzles me at first but with an answer that seems glaringly obvious once I have it.

Name another setter whose work you admire.

I was always a fan of Alec Robins, Custos in the Guardian. His puzzles were entertaining although not difficult. It was only when I started writing my own clues that I realised how precise and elegantly constructed his were.

Tell us about lakedistrictwalks.com.

When I first joined the internet in 1996, I was intrigued by the design of websites and wanted to see whether I could create one myself. As I used to do a lot of fellwalking that seemed to be a good topic and so I started the site. Other walkers gave me a lot of encouragement and the website just grew.

How do people respond when you tell them that you’re a crossword setter?

Most say they don’t do crosswords, most are intrigued – and occasionally they are fans. I once got chatting to a French student while walking back to Grasmere after an enjoyable day on the fells and he asked what I did for a living. When I explained, he said he enjoyed meeting people with interesting jobs. I asked him what he was studying. “The trapeze,” he replied.

Finally, if you weren’t setting crosswords, what would you be doing?

The world is full of things that spark my interest. When I was a child I was taken to dancing classes: very unusual for a lad in a mining village. I stopped dancing in my teens and only started again recently. After struggling to find a ballroom partner who wanted to improve rather than dance just for fun, I finally met someone of like mind and a year ago we started competing in the National League.

We dance about four times a week, which we both feel is enough, so what else would I do? When I lived in London I went to a lot of concerts on South Bank and at the Albert Hall. I miss that and so would probably spend the extra time going to concerts either in Manchester or locally. Walking the Lakeland fells would still be a draw for me, too.



Many thanks to Chifonie and good luck with the National League. The answers to the clues above are DOES (double definition), PROVERB (ROVER inside the chemical symbol Pb) and IDIOT (an acrostic).

From cold comfort to hot gossip, there is ingenious construction and of-the-moment bullying in the pick of the broadsheets’ cryptics

Grid references

I hope you enjoyed the Easter weekend’s special puzzles. In place of spoilers, here are a couple of recent feats of construction.

Morph (Meet the Setter here) in the Independent had this as his central down clue ...

8d As a result of climate change, the earth is a degree closer to game over? (7,6)

... a double definition of GETTING WARMER. And so the grid did:

It looks to me like all the across entries in the top half relate to coldness; the Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English gives TATERS as an adjective for “cold” via the rhyming slang “potatoes in the mould”.

And I can see the heat, or at least warmth, in the across entries in the bottom half; that is, so long as I imagine that 14 across evokes an issue of Heat magazine giving some tittle-tattle on former members of Hot Gossip. Unless of course I’m missing something?



Meanwhile, in another paper, every perimeter entry contained a Z in a grid featuring no less than ten izzards. I usually enjoy such because-they-can achievements, but when the paper in question is the steady-as-she-goes, typically theme-free Times ...

Times Crossword 26,698

... it feels ominous, like ravens fleeing the Tower of London or a silent Today programme.

Latter patter

Incidentally, GOSSIP (from the Old English “godsibb”, God-relative) originally meant a baptismal sponsor, then a close friend, and then an acquaintance who uses their intimacy to create idle talk.

From hot back to cold, and another of Morph’s identities: in a Telegraph Toughie, Micawber gave us a clue ...

2d Delicate thing currently getting criticism in some quarters (9)

[ synonym for ‘currently’ + synonym for ‘criticism’, both inside (‘in’) abbrevs for points of the compass (‘some quarters’) ]

[ NOW + FLAK, both inside S E ]

... for SNOWFLAKE with very contemporary resonances. Since its appearance in a tough-talkin’ speech from Chuck Palahniuk’s novel Fight Club ...

Listen up, maggots. You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You’re the same decaying organic matter as everything else.

... SNOWFLAKE has, well, snowballed to become “the defining insult of 2016” – and indeed of 2017. Used by bullies, the new meaning of SNOWFLAKE insists that anyone who’s the slightest concerned about a far-right takeover of the West is by definition prone to over-reaction and so can be excluded from conversation.

Other terms designed to silence include SOCIAL-JUSTICE WARRIOR (those who are opposed to bigotry recast as doctrinaire zealots who can be ignored), and the subject of our next challenge. Originally a neutral term for a defender – and for a while via Through the Looking-Glass an enthusiastic but ineffectual person – it’s now used to dismiss any man who opposes sexism on the grounds that the only reason you might have for doing so is to seduce any women in earshot: reader, how would you clue WHITE KNIGHT?

Cluing competition

Thanks for your clues for HUSSAR. The word lends itself to such apposite clues as Ousgg’s “One who shouts as sabre is selectively deployed?” and Schroduck’s “Horseman usually seen sallying against revolutionary vanguards”, though also such misdirection as Catarella’s resonant “One up against Gunners, with Spurs shouting ‘hooray’!”

The runners-up are Phitonelly’s topical “Once a defender of Europe, Theresa’s heart has us confused” and Steveran’s acrostic “He’s usually shown sabre-rattling and removing heads”; the winner is DameSweeneyEggblast’s “Has us corralled by King’s Lynn’s faithful horseman”.



Kludos to Sweeney; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the broadsheet cryptics below.

Clue of the Fortnight

When you see numerals below 30 in a clue, you check whether you’ve yet solved the clues elsewhere which are correspondingly numbered. In Paul’s recent Guardian puzzle, this was time enjoyably wasted ...

21/5d Serve alcohol in a quandary — might one be 16 or 18? (6-6)

[ anagram (“in a quandary”) of SERVEALCOHOL ]

... since these numerals were part of the definition of SCHOOL-LEAVER. As Nutmeg reminded us in last week’s engaging Meet The Setter, Paul is going to try to set a 26-clue cryptic while running the London Marathon on 23 April, and can be sponsored (for Sense) for this nonsense.

A 100th-anniversary puzzle whose subject is around to enjoy it, plus the best of the rest from the cryptic world

The news in clues

Not since 2011 has April Fools’ Day fallen on a Saturday. In the world of crosswords, this is a heady combination, since Saturday puzzles tend to be more elaborate and are more prone to themes and knavish tricks, leaving the solver of any Saturday 1 Aprils wondering whether something extra is going on in the perimeter of the grid or in the clues – or even, when the puzzle seems to have an April Fools’ theme, whether this is part of some meta-foolery. But, for all I know, I’ve already said too much.

Saturday puzzles also tend to have prizes or at least to keep their solutions back for a week or more. Given this column’s policy of not discussing “live” puzzles, all I can do now is gather links to Saturday’s puzzles that exist online – from the Guardian, the Telegraph, the Independent, the FT, the Listener and even perhaps the Times – as a reminder.

I haven’t yet solved them all myself, and any or all of them may be free of fooling. Given last year’s absence of trickery, though, I’m hoping for something silly somewhere. Further (spoiler-free) links welcome below.

Latter patter

Dylan Thomas missed his. So did Benjamin Britten and Roald Dahl. In fact, it is very rare that a) the 100th anniversary of someone’s birth is marked in crossword form and b) that he or she is around to see it.

Happily, both conditions apply in the case of Vera Lynn. Clued at 19 and 12 down as FORCES’ SWEETHEART, the centenarian was celebrated, like the other three above, by Gaff in the FT (there’s more on Gaff’s treatment of anniversaries in his Meet the Setter).

I especially enjoyed Gaff exploiting the potential offered by birds appearing in two of the Dame’s greatest hits. With “19, 12” referring those entries FORCES and SWEETHEART, we had ...

9ac/24ac One of a group from 19, 12 that’ll be beneath Sialia (5,5)

... for, via bluebirds, a WHITE CLIFF ...

... and ...

11ac Where 19, 12’s Luscinia made notes (8,6)



... this time, via a nightingale, BERKELEY SQUARE.

My favourite Lynn song did not make it in, but it was a chart hit in 1957 and leads us to our next challenge. The Hungarian cousin of the Italian CORSAIR, Lynn sang of a faithful one (in the original German, “Der treue Husar”, a pleasing echo of the meaning of “Vera”); reader, how would you clue HUSSAR?

Cluing competition

Thanks for your clues for SUPERCILIOUS. I enjoyed such miniature tales as Catarella’s “Arrogant policeman found with a hundred one pound notes promising to pay it back” and Robi23’s “Curious piles embarrassed cavalier”.

The runners-up are Steveran’s ominous “Overbearing power lies with curious rabble” and Wordfuzz’s (tweaked) “Curious spiel devised for the arrogant”. The winner is Chrisbeee’s instruction to a cinematic composer: “Perilous music plays when maiden departs on high horse.”

Kludos to Chrisbeee; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the broadsheet cryptics below.

Clue of the fortnight

The mind boggles at the sight of the first two words of Rosa Klebb’s FT clue ...

10d Trump sources regularly tell me husband wears trousers (9)

[ every other letter (‘regularly’ of TELLME, then abbrev. for husband inside (‘wears’) synonym for ‘trousers’ ]

[ ELE, then H inside PANTS ]

... before realising that the only political connection here is that the US president’s son enjoys firing bullets into ELEPHANTS.

Inspector Morse creator Colin Dexter, who died on Tuesday, was a prolific creator of crosswords both real and fictional. Here are five clues that sum up his life of witty wordplay

Take in bachelor? It could do (3)

No sooner has DI Morse met Sgt Lewis for the first time than Morse thrusts a copy of the Times at Lewis and tells him to, “Have a look at 14 down.” Lewis, an occasional solver of the Mirror’s quick crossword, is “much puzzled”.

Morse, played by John Thaw in the TV adaptation, explains that it is the curious mixture of highbrow (R from the abbreviation for recipe, the Latin for “take”, inside BA, a bachelor’s degree) and lowbrow (the answer, BRA) that appeals to his cryptic mind. He asks: “Do you think I’m wasting your time, Lewis?”

Colin Dexter: a mischievous, generous man every bit as clever as his creations Read more

But of course, there’s a connection to the murder they’re about to work on; more importantly, Lewis’s reply (“Yes, sir”) reveals him to be the perfect sidekick.

It also proved, nine pages into his first novel, that the writer, Colin Dexter, was as deft with the misdirection and playfulness of cryptic cluing as he was with the same elements of the whodunnit.

Item gran arranged family slides in? (5,7)

This is Dexter’s clue for MAGIC LANTERN, the predecessor of the slide projector. In the wordplay, you “arrange” the letters of ITEM GRAN, then “slide in” another word for “family”: CLAN. The clue works simultaneously as a fair definition of the answer, and as a recipe for the answer’s letters. Such all-in-one clues are the acme of cryptic setting, and Dexter rightly won a prize.

Colin Dexter with John Thaw in 1990. Photograph: ITV/REX/Shutterstock

The prize was for the monthly clue-writing competition for solvers of the Observer’s crossword, as much cerebral community as puzzle, which Dexter first entered 60 years ago. The winners are announced in a newsletter, which in 1976 noted “the disappearance from these lists for some time of NC (Colin) Dexter, for many years a redoubtable competitor”.

Dexter had taken time off crosswords to write the first two Morse novels, but had not forsaken them: in the first, Last Bus to Woodstock, every character except the murderer is named after a competition entrant, most notably Dexter’s arch-rivals: Lloyds chairman Sir Jeremy Morse and crossword setter Mrs B Lewis.

The real-life Morse, Dexter’s neighbour and “the cleverest man I ever met”, became a friend when Dexter was pruning a hedge in the 1960s. Morse introduced himself by saying: “I thought we’d better get acquainted.” And the fictional Morse took Dexter from famous-in-crosswords to famous full-stop.

Bradman’s famous duck (6)

Presently, Dexter began setting entire puzzles, as Codex for the Oxford Times, in a style that was tricky but playful and demanding of local knowledge. His wonderfully apt nom de guerre made him a full member of the club of Britain’s pseudonymous setters.

But he saved some of his best for Morse to solve. The clue above, which alludes to Don Bradman’s notorious dismissal at the Oval in 1948, is ingenious but very simple in its two definitions of DONALD: Bradman himself, and the celebrated cartoon waterfowl. In the novel, the clue is attributed to Quixote, a real-life setter known in this paper as Pasquale, who ruefully remarked: “Oh, that I had written it!”

In which are the Islets of Langerhans (8)

And Morse’s solving was no mere hobby. Our next clue, putatively from the Times, takes him two minutes to solve, making his time for the whole puzzle a frustrating 12 and a half minutes. But his pride’s loss is law and order’s gain.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Dexter on set, 1996. Photograph: Tim Ockenden/PA

Once Morse fathoms that the setter intends for him to waste time wondering whether those islets are in the Baltic or the South China Sea, when really they are in the PANCREAS, he grasps that the suspects in The Silent Death of Nicholas Quinn are likewise colluding to make him answer the wrong question: in this case, who was at the cinema for a blue movie, when in fact no one was.

The trouble with my method, Lewis, is it’s inspirational. And as a result, I sometimes – sometimes – get things arse-about-face.

The Morse novels are a celebration of thinking like a crossword solver: it’s a hobby that makes you more sceptical, more nimble, and – at least in the case of Morse – one that saves lives.



The hidden extra answer among the entries MOROCCO, LINEAGE, CEDED and EXTERIORS

Eagle-eyed Times solvers on 18 March 1993 might have noticed that as well as the answers JOHN and THAW, if you read from the end of one clue into the start of another, you could see the names of the composer and creator of the Morse TV series.

The steady-as-she-goes Times only really indulges in themes and hidden answers for events such as royal weddings, so this is was high praise indeed from the crosswording world.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Dexter in March 2017. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer

You can only hope that Dexter was kept in the dark and got to solve that one himself. He was a mean solver, too, and aimed to finish a puzzle in the time it took to eat his breakfast egg.

He gave up solving in 2009, when his eyesight was no longer up to it, but only this year called an end to 30 years of Hitchcock-like cameos in Morse, its sequel, Lewis, and its prequel, Endeavour.

He leaves us with those tales, the puzzles collected in book form as Chambers Morse Puzzles and the hundreds of commended clues in the archives of the Observer competition.

This replaces Monday’s post; the next post will appear on 3 April. Colin Dexter’s Desert Island Discs are available here.

I regularly get emails from people offering me a puzzle for publication or asking how one becomes a Guardian crossword setter. I wish my replies could be more positive, but the facts are these.

We have a team of about 25 cryptic setters and publish about 310 cryptic puzzles a year. This means that, on average, each setter appears about once a month. Some, notably Paul and Rufus, appear more often than that and, for all kinds of reasons, some less often. However, I think that, if they regularly appear less than once a month, setters do not have much chance of establishing their style and personality with solvers. From these figures it will be clear that the chances of becoming one of the setting team are discouragingly low. For the same reasons, we do not publish ‘one off’ puzzles, except in the most exceptional circumstances. The only recent example of a ‘one off’ was No 27,132 set by Sphinx on 28 February, where the puzzle featured centrally that evening in ‘The Riddle of the Sphinx’, an episode in this year’s series of the BBC2 programmes ‘Inside No 9’ (http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04tmfxs). The puzzle was set by Steve Pemberton, joint writer of the series, who in this episode played the devious Professor Squires with Alexandra Roach as one of his students, Nina.

Of course, every now and then, but very rarely, a new name joins the setting team. No formal process of selection is involved and no specific qualifications are needed. The only absolute requirement is evidence, from published or unpublished examples, of a capacity to produce on a regular basis puzzles of a standard suitable for the Guardian. Despite that fact that the money is poor (£167 per 15x15 cryptic puzzle actually published, to be precise – not exactly a good hourly rate for the labour involved), my file of ‘hopefuls’ who clearly meet that standard is substantial. And, other things being equal, I aim to choose a new name who both lowers the average age of and raises the proportion of female setters in the team. Over time setters come and go, but you can see how the odds are stacked against any particular person becoming one of our regulars.

Paul completed his London Marathon run on 23 April, raising money for Sense, the national charity for the deafblind. He confesses that it was not his personal best time for the run, as he had other things on his mind, namely thinking up a crossword clue per mile to complete the 26-clue grid that Imogen had set him for the occasion. Paul’s own account of how it all went was carried in the Guardian’s G2 on 25 April (https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/shortcuts/2017/apr/24/my-marathon-crossword-challenge-cryptic-setter-paul). The resulting puzzle was published as the Saturday prize No 27,184 on 29 April. If you would still like to donate money to his chosen charity, the slot is still open at https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/J-Halpern1 .

Crossword coincidences have been on my mind this last month. Most of you will know the story of how eight top secret code words appeared as solutions in the Daily Telegraph crossword in the weeks immediately before the Normandy D-Day landings on 6 June 1944. These were Juno, Gold and Sword (the three British and Canadian assault beaches) and Omaha and Utah (the two American targets). On 27 May, Overlord (code for the entire operation) appeared, followed on 30 May by Mulberry (the floating harbours) and on 1 June Neptune (code for the naval assault operation).

The puzzles had been set by Leonard Dawe, headmaster of a school evacuated to Effingham in Surrey. Less well known is the earlier story that, on the day before the disastrous Dieppe raid in August 1942, involving 5,000 Canadian, 1,000 British and 50 American troops, most of whom were immediately killed or captured, Dieppe appeared as a Telegraph solution. In both cases MI5 descended like a ton of bricks, but finally chose to conclude that these were just ‘coincidences’.

With Dawe, this was not exactly true. He was wont to encourage some of his brighter pupils to fill in his blank grids for him. These lads used to go into town and mix with American and Canadian soldiers, who talked pretty freely about the coming invasion, slipping code words into their conversation. One 14-year-old in particular, Ronald French, jotted some of these down in notebooks, whence in due course they made it into the Telegraph. When Dawe was told the full story, he immediately confiscated and burned the books and made Ronald swear on the Bible that he would never tell a soul about the incident. He kept his oath until the mid-1980s, Dawe having died in 1963, aged 73. A fuller account of all this may be read in Val Gilbert’s collection of 80 years of Telegraph cryptic crosswords (Macmillan, 2004).

Our ‘coincidence’ concerns the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and his remarks about the Scottish National Party to Scottish Labour’s spring conference at Perth on 25 February. He likened SNP policy to the behaviour of those who use race or religion for political ends, though ‘only in the sense that it pits one part of the country against another’.

Two days later the Guardian published an opinion piece by Claire Heuchan, a Scottish black radical feminist studying for a PhD at Stirling University. Her view was that Sadiq was right in speaking out. ‘Someone has to say it: the parallels are clear. There is an obvious overlap between nationalism and racism: both mentalities are defined by a politics of us and them’, she wrote.

And then, on 1 March, we published a cryptic puzzle by Picaroon, where the consecutive, but unconnected, solutions to 12 and 14 across were STURGEON RACIST. If you are still following the story, you will not be surprised to be told that this was, unlike with Dawe, completely coincidental. The facts are as follows.

Picaroon sent me his puzzle on 2 October last year and I filed it without looking with his other offerings. I process puzzles in weekly batches of six, so I took this particular one and five others out of the drawer in mid-February, edited them and then wired them in to the Guardian in final form at 8am on 21 February. After that I thought no more about them and moved on to dealing with the following week’s puzzles. Neither I nor Picaroon read the Khan speech at Perth, nor the Heuchan opinion piece until people started rather urgently asking questions about the puzzle. As it happens, both of us rather admire Nicola Sturgeon, as being a party leader who is a cut above the others presently on offer, but that is neither here nor there. And, if you are still reluctant to believe that ‘STURGEON RACIST’ could possibly have been just a coincidence, let me tell you that the notion of being able to commission a new crossword puzzle on a Monday morning and to get an edited version of it into the paper’s computer system by the next day is for the birds.

Our setter Paul, who in other ways strikes me as being a sensible fellow, has decided to run the London marathon again on 23 April. He is doing so to raise money for Sense, the national charity that supports the deafblind. And he is doing so in memory of his older brother, named Paul, who died in 1989 at the age of 27 as a result of an accident in Snowdonia, from whom he took his Guardian nom de plume. And not just run the 26 miles and 385 yards involved. He has asked a friend to fill a crossword grid with 26 solutions (one for each mile of the marathon). At each mile post someone will hold up a board with a solution on it. Over the next mile our hero intends to set (in his head while running) a clue for that solution and dictate it into a small cassette recorder, strapped to one wrist. By the finishing line he should, on this basis, have produced a complete cryptic crossword.

My only role in all of this, apart from trying to persuade him that the idea is crazy, is to find a way of publishing the result, provided (that is) that the recorded clues are not just dehydrated gibberish. But he would be happy beyond words, if Guardian crossword enthusiasts (or indeed anyone of a charitable disposition) were willing to join in sponsoring him by donating to his Sense link, which is: https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/J-Halpern1.

February’s Genius No 164 by Crucible had 21 correct entries on the first day and 248 by the deadline. Two of the first three correct entries received were from Australia. The first, in his now regular place, was ‘PSC’ at 01:54. In third place (a newcomer in this position) was ‘maaj’ from Brisbane at 07:10. Between them came another regular, ‘m1f’ from the UK at 02:36.

A real pleasure for a crossword editor is the way that one gets led down totally unexpected paths. I asked here recently how long we could go on using the crossword conventions that ‘ship’ = SS and that wording in a clue such as ‘on board’ indicates that one S should go at the front and the other S at the back of a solution. But I knew for a fact that SS stands for steamship. How wrong I was.

A steamship (or steamer) is (or was) an ocean-going vessel propelled by one or more steam engines, driving paddlewheels or propellers (screws). These ships were designated as either PS (paddle steamship) or SS (screw steamship). As PSs disappeared, it became popularly assumed that SS stood for steamship, an error that I have perpetrated, man and boy, ever since I started going down to the sea in ships. Now, of course, almost all shipping is driven by internal combustion engines of one sort of another and so they are MVs (motor vessels). I doubt whether there is a single ocean-going vessel still afloat in a seaworthy condition that is an SS.

You may remember the Saturday prize puzzle No 27,046 (19 November 2016), set by Arachne, Nutmeg and Puck under the joint nom de plume of Bogus. It marked World Toilet Day and invited donations to a charity bringing clean water and safe sanitation to people lacking them in the 12 poorest countries in Africa and Asia (www.toilettwinning.org). The charity has just told us that £3,432 of the donations made since that date specifically mentioned that they were being made because of that puzzle. As Sir John Major might say, that it ‘not an inconsiderable amount’, for it can provide a single toilet for £60, or a school toilet block for £240.

December’s Genius No 162 by Enigmatist produced 31 entries on the first day and 256 by the deadline. PSC from Australia was first in again at 03:46, followed by PC3542 at 04:18 and m1f at 04:52.

The January Genius No 163 by Qaos got off to a very slow start because of a system failure, for which I apologise and which must have been very frustrating for the waiting night owls. Eventually, the first in was a newcomer, DR in New Zealand at 09:43. SC@btinternet would have been second at 11:46, but for a slip in filling in the wrong solution for 26 across. So the second correct entry was from PSC in Australia at 11:55. There were 20 entries on the first day and 213 by the end. As some of you pointed out, there was an ambiguity in the word to enter for 9 across: ‘One suggesting expert puzzle?’ produced PROPOSER, but there were then alternative two-letter symbols for chemical elements that might be removed: Os for osmium or Po for polonium, leading respectively to PROPER or PROSER (to be found in both Chambers and Collins as a person who writes prose), either of which fitted into the grid. The great majority went for PROPER, but both solutions were accepted as correct.

While on the subject of the Genius puzzle, it is accepted that a less clunky way of entering each month than the existing online form is devoutly to be wished. However, in the present tough financial climate for newspapers, I have to be straight and say that there is no indication of this item on the crossword ‘wish list’ coming over the horizon any time soon. (The same, I fear, is the case with the wish to make it possible to enter online for the weekly Saturday prize Cryptic, as well as by post and fax.) So, as the ‘provisional’ is likely to endure for some time, may I make these points?

a) Solutions entered in the form should be the words as they are required to be entered in the grid, ie if the required solution reads backwards or is gobbledegook for some other reason, that is how it should be entered.

b) It matters not if spaces or hyphens are include or left out, nor whether Shakespeare, say, is written as Bard, bard or BARD.

c) The software for filling in the form is standard for most such online operations, ie hitting the ‘enter’ key tells the system that you are finished. In our case, pressing it will send your entry form off smartly to the Guardian. If you want just to move to the next box to be filled in, you should use the space alignment key (usually to be found on the left-hand side or your keyboard), or else move your cursor to the next box and click.

Happy Christmas to you all. Thank you for your patience in 2016 when things went awry, for which I apologise. And thanks to those who took time to send notes of appreciation for what has been on offer. I have taken some comfort from the fact that the number of those complaining that the puzzles have been getting too easy is almost exactly the same as the number complaining that they have been getting too hard, hoping that this is some evidence at least that we continue to face in roughly the right direction. I particularly liked a comment last month from ‘slezska’ – ‘The first rule of the Guardian crossword: Paul is usually easier than the average Paul and Rufus is usually harder than the average Rufus.’

As advance warning, you may like to know that Maskarade’s Christmas offering (a jumbo alphabetical with a theme) will be published on Christmas Eve. Deadline for entries is extended to 4 January and the solution and winners will be announced on 6 January.

A footnote to the discussion of cryptic clues: it concerns what constitutes a fair lead to an initial letter or letters being part of the required solution. Michael B, who lives in France, has raised the issue with me more than once. Take, for example, the letter B. For some time I have accepted that the word ‘British’ in a clue could indicate that there is a B in the solution (or in the required anagram). Obviously, B = British in contexts like the BBC but why, he argues, should British = B in a clue when no such specific context is indicated? On this principle, he questioned a clue in a recent Picaroon puzzle (No 27,016, 3 down), where ‘Fully exhaust and dismiss old fellow (3,3,2)’ was intended to produce the solution RUN OUT OF. ‘Run-out’ is obviously one way of getting dismissed at cricket, but how, he objected, are you expected to know that in this clue O = old and F = fellow. He clearly has a point.

My answer, however, is that crosswords, like most human activity, have conventions shared by those involved; and that clearly these conventions change over time. When I started editing the Guardian crosswords, national identity letters linked to car number plates were not generally accepted as crossword conventions. Today, I think, A = Austria, E = Spain, PL = Poland and the rest have become conventionally accepted, though I might still draw the line, for example, at BF = Burkina Faso, or SF = Finland, as being a bit recherché. And, back in those olden days, internet country top-level domain codes were not the stuff of daily intercourse. Today, though, most setters and solvers would accept that .de = Germany and .za = South Africa, though is not perhaps all of them, such as .tv (Tuvalu), .tj (Tajikistan) or .ba (Bosnia and Herzegovina).

In the other direction, even accepted crossword conventions eventually die a natural death. Early in my time as crossword editor (though I could see its great helpfulness to a setter in trouble over a difficult clue, I insisted on killing off the convention that ‘charge’ in a clue was a fair way to reach ION in a solution. (I did so on the grounds that the convention was simply too wrong to be acceptable, since an ion is an atom or molecule, not an electric charge.) West = MAE hangs on as a convention, mainly, I suspect, because it can be so useful to setters. But the popular memory of the great (in every sense) film star must be have faded amongst the under-50s and her association with RAF inflatable life jackets in WWII is decidedly dated. I worry, too, about the accepted convention that ‘ship’ = SS, as the last launch of one to be powered by steam must predate the birth of the majority of our solvers. ‘Army’ or ‘volunteers’ = TA is another anachronism, since the then Conservative defence secretary Liam Fox abolished the Territorial Army over five years ago.

So how should a crossword editor negotiate these shifting sands? The traditional shelter in a storm is one of the respectable 1-volume English dictionaries, where each alphabetical section starts with a list of words for which that letter is an accepted abbreviation. This, however, is of no comfort to Michael B in France, because Chambers, for example, sanctions B, O and F as legitimate abbreviations for ‘British’, ‘old’ and ‘fellow’. Looking for consistency in editing clues, I have come increasingly to depend on another Chambers publication, ‘Chambers XWD: a dictionary of crossword abbreviations’, produced in 2005 by Michael Kindred and Derrick Knight, both cryptic crossword setters of distinction and jointly also authors of ‘Cryptic Crosswords and How to Solve Them’ (Chambers, 1993). Their XWD book has become a great comfort to me and I comment it to Michael B and any others in doubt!

With the festive season again upon us, I am happy to help by suggesting a range of modestly priced Guardian and Guardian-related puzzle things for you to choose as gifts:

* Eric Westbrook’s 3-D crossword puzzle calendar. Each month has its own puzzle. As a bonus it is linked online to a monthly prize competition and a newsletter for the solutions. There is a program available for downloading that enables totally blind solvers to take part. Of the home team, Arachne, Enigmatist, Nutmeg, Pasquale, Picaroon, Puck and Rufus have each set one of the 12 puzzles. Of each purchase price of £12.99 £5 goes to the BBC Children in Need Appeal, with the remaining net profit shared between BBC CiNA and the RNIB Pears Centre for Specialist Learning. All is better explained at www.calendarpuzzles.co.uk where the 2017 calendar may be ordered.

* Boatman has been setting cryptic puzzles for the Guardian since 2008. Last month he published Boatman the First 50, which is what is says on the label – his first 50 Guardian puzzles, each with a story attached of how it came into being, of his thought processes in developing it and of the interaction involved between setter, solver and even, so help me, editor. It should be of particular interest to aspiring setters and may help to disabuse them of the idea that all there is to setting a puzzle for publication is to upload Crossword Compiler software, fill in a grid and think up some passable clues. The book is available from www.ypdbooks.com or from what are known as the better bookshops.

* In 2013 our very own crossword blogger Alan Connor wrote a book to mark the conventionally accepted 100th anniversary on 21 December 1913 of the publication of the first ‘modern’ crossword in the long defunct New York World. Its title was Two Girls, One on Each Knee, taken from a clue [PAT + ELLA] set by Rufus (though in his anonymous moonlighting capacity as a Daily Telegraph setter). This month Alan has produced another book, The Joy of Quiz, which with the same informative and jolly style covers the 80 years during which the quiz has become a British national institution to rival the crossword.

* Can You Solve My Problems? is a compilation by Alex Bellos, author of the wonderful Futebol: the Brazilian way of life, made up of 125 classic puzzles of the last 2,000 years from all over the world. They will keep everyone going for the full Twelve Days of Christmas and far beyond: available from https://bookshop.theguardian.com .

* I am getting a bit suspicious about the recent urge on the part of the UK security services (MI5, MI6 and GCHQ) to come out of the closet and tell, if not all, at least something. Within very living memory the Government Communications Headquarters (pre-1946 it hid itself in plain view as the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park) would never comment on what it was up to or even admit publicly that it existed. But last month Penguin published The GCHQ Puzzle Book, inviting you to test yourself against more than 140 pages of codes, puzzles and other challenges set by its code breakers. It even has a foreword by the Duchess of Cambridge, whose grandmother Valerie Middleton (née Glassborow) was one of the posh young women who worked as secretarial staff in ‘Hut 6’ at Bletchley. Proceeds from the sale of this puzzle book are to be donated to Heads Together, the mental health campaign with which she, Prince William and Prince Harry are connected.

Patrick Wildgust, the Curator of the Laurence Sterne Trust, recently asked if I could help him with an even more abstruse puzzle than any in the books listed above. He looks after Shandy Hall, the house in the village of Coxwold in North Yorkshire where the author of Tristram Shandy (published between 1759 and 1767) lived and wrote in the last half of his life (d. 1768).

Torquemada, the Observer crossword setter Powys Mathers, produced a Puzzle Book published by Victor Gollancz in 1934. Its final puzzle takes the apparent form of a 100-page murder-mystery novelette entitled ‘Cain’s Jawbone’. You are told that, by accident, the pages have been printed in an entirely haphazard order but that it is logically possible for a solver by intelligent reading to sort the pages into the only possible correct order. The re-ordered story then allows the solver, in some unspecified way, to list the six murderers involved, together with their victims. The then generous prize of £15 was offered for the first two correct entries but no record seems to exist anywhere of the solution to this puzzle.

Two more recent books have used the same device, known as ‘a book in a box’, ie one where the pages are loose and in no particular order. One is Composition No 1 (1962) by the French experimental novelist Marc Saporta, who died in 2009, aged 86; the other is The Unfortunates (1969) by the English polymath B.S. Johnson, who committed suicide in 1973, aged 40. Patrick is working on connections between the three novels and the Torquemada puzzle and would be greatly assisted by discovering the solution the ‘Cain’s Jawbone’ puzzle. Any ideas?

Work is under way to get the monthly Genius puzzle added to the system that handles the rest of the crossword puzzles. But it may take some time yet to get there and, meanwhile, the puzzle still has to be uploaded manually by the central production team. However, this uploading process seems to have been less accident-prone in the last couple of months and my fingers remain crossed.

September’s Genius No 159 by Jack attracted 25 entries on the first day and 224 by the deadline. PSC, a regular faithful from Australia, was first in at 05:28 on 1 September but the next four were, I think, newcomers at the top of the entry board: MLN @btinternet (07:17), OMP @O (09:24), wetmtz (10:39) and TGOxford (11:03). October’s puzzle, No 160 by Puck, had two old hands in first and second place (m1f at 03:59 and PSC from Australia at 04:16), followed by a considerable gap before the next entry, of which there were 24 by the end of the first day and 268 by the deadline. The current Genius No 161 is the second to be set by Soup. In his true colours as Hamish Symington, Soup has just taken over from Tom Johnson as editor of the monthly crossword subscription magazine 1 Across. This closes another Guardian crossword circle, for the magazine was founded by Araucaria in 1984 and edited by him until 1994. Tom Johnson, known to us as Maskarade, edited the magazine from 2000 until this year. And Hamish Symington designed and installed Araucaria’s personal crossword website, from which he took orders for bespoke cryptic puzzles. Not surprisingly, there was heavy demand for personalised Araucaria puzzles, the fees for which he donated to charity.

Our cryptic crossword solvers seem deeply divided as to whether they have become too difficult or not. Hugh Stephenson looks at some of the evidence.

Late August became open season in the Guardian letters page for shooting cryptic puzzles for not being what they were in the good old days. The onslaught was triggered by a letter published on 23 August. Next day there were a couple more in the same vein. But it was on 26 August that the massed guns were launched. A large section of the letters page that day was given over to the battle. In case you missed it, you can recapture the action by clicking on: https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2016/aug/26/cryptic-crosswords-im-sorry-i-havent-a-clue.

Aware that younger solvers and all of our growing number of overseas readers do the crosswords online and do not pay to buy the paper, I checked that admirable site Fifteen Squared, where the British ‘broadsheet’ cryptic puzzles are independently monitored each day, to see what comments were being registered there. I found that Sil van den Hoek had posted a comment on 28 August to the effect that he found the collection of letters published in the Guardian two days earlier to be odd. His comment has since attracted 93 further responses. Not surprisingly, perhaps, since the Fifteen Squared site is most used by regular online crossword enthusiasts, these 93 comments are almost as universally in favour of the Guardian Cryptic as the letters in the paper were critical. The van den Hoek collection can be seen at: http://www.fifteensquared.net/2016/08/28/the-guardian-letters-27-08-2106-i-havent-a-clue/.

I tend to be wary of those who look at the past and find it rose-tinted. Of course, like anything else if it is to survive and prosper, the cryptic puzzle has to evolve over time. Araucaria has deservedly joined the pantheon of all-time great setters, though many crossword luminaries like Colin Dexter and Jeremy Morse were pretty snooty about his cluing when he was still active. His bank holiday jumbo specials were of the highest quality but people seem to have forgotten that they were every bit as intricate as those that Maskarade is currently producing. When I became crossword editor in 1997 Paul, who is now an established Guardian favourite, had many vociferous critics. The much-lamented Bunthorne could never have been described as a setter of easier puzzles than, say, Puck or Picaroon today. As to the tricks of the trade, they too have developed and changed. But it is certainly much easier now than it was then for tyro solvers to learn about them. If you are stuck today on a particular clue, a note of explanation is provided by the excellent commentators at http://www.fifteensquared.net.

I inherited a policy that, in principle, each week of Guardian Cryptics should contain two average, two easier and two more difficult puzzles. In the first six months of this year we published 156 cryptic puzzles. It is subjective to classify a particular setter as difficult or easy and some, notably Paul like Araucaria before him, slips the odd easier puzzle in with his other deliveries. But, suppose you allow that Arachne, Brendan, Chifonie, Nutmeg, Orlando, Rufus and Shed are towards the more non-devious end of the spectrum, in these six months 49 of their puzzles were published, just three short of a third of the total. Of those, 19 were by Rufus, by far the most regularly published setter apart from Paul.

In short, although things have indeed changed over the past 20 years, it is perhaps surprising, given the changes in the demographic of our crossword solvers and the changes in language and technology, that they have not been greater.

Many of you will be familiar with Eric Westbrook’s extraordinary 3-D crossword puzzle calendars, produced in aid of BBC Children in Need and the Royal National Institute of Blind People. It is planned that there should again be a calendar for 2017, but this year the monthly puzzles are just available online. The puzzle for this September is promoted as being 3-D ‘but with an added 4-D element’. The Guardian’s Puck has been closely involved in producing this September puzzle. You can download it by going to http://www.calendarpuzzles.co.uk/puzzle_downloads.php and selecting the Puzzle and Answer Grid buttons for September. Downloading is free, though you are offered the option of making a contribution to charity. The deadline is the last day of September and, for every correct entry received, £1 will be donated to Air Ambulance and the John Radcliffe Hospital in memory of Ray Parry-Morris, one of the grid designers for the 3-D puzzles, who died last month after a short illness.

We have continued to have problems over the summer with uploading the Genius puzzle at the right time and with the correct format. It has not yet been possible to include it in the new system for handling the other puzzles. As a result it still has to be loaded ‘manually’ and it cannot be properly checked until it has gone live. However, the September Genius by Jack seems to have been without problem, so my fingers are crossed for the future.

June’s Genius No 156, Pasquale’s midsummer puzzle, attracted a large number of first-day entries (51) and 295 in total by the deadline. ‘jeremy@g’ was first in at 01:28, followed 50 minutes later by ‘psc’ from Australia and ‘m1f’.

No 157 by Picaroon for July got off to a bad start and so had only 14 entries on the first day. There were 230 in total by the deadline. ‘mark.n’ was first in at 10:03, followed by ‘hookt’ at 10:07 and ‘don@demon’ at 10:40.

You seem to have found No 158 for July by Paul the hardest of these three, with 10 in on the first day and only 181 in total. ‘m1f’ was first in at 04:36, followed by ‘fg@yahoo’ at 13:13.

In supporting Jean Jackson’s plea (Letters, 23 August), I think that too-clever-by-half crossword compilers invent new rules to preserve their self-awarded intellectual power. Too many see themselves as Araucaria or Ximenes, assuming every challenge to be for prizes for which there must be a limited list of winners. We cruciverbalists face barely conceived neologisms; foreign practice; topical proper and trade names; web-speak; and irrelevant whole words representing unrelated single-letter abbreviations not recognised in any glossary.

We are expected to discover hidden themes, without being told that a theme exists – such as, last week, the names of the 1966 England World Cup team. That was totally unfair, presenting 11 unsolvable clues. Compilers should copy the Observer’s Azed and publish the logic of the more knotty clues with the solution – as not all compilers share the same devious mindset.

Ralph Gee

• Thank goodness other readers are finding the current crop of cryptic crosswords impossible. I thought it was just me. Perhaps we should form a support group and call ourselves Araucaria’s Anonymous. It used to be fun and the clues had wit, but now it’s a chore with impenetrable clues that go on forever and often with a four-word solution. I offer a possible way of dealing with the problem to my fellow sufferers.

Many years ago I played Ariel in the Tempest at the Old Vic with John Gielgud playing Prospero. Every day in the rehearsal room during tea breaks and idle moments Sir John would sit quietly doing the Times crossword. Sometimes he would complete it and put it aside within 20 minutes or so. Everyone was terribly impressed. The Times crossword was, in those days, the toughest nut in the bowl.

One afternoon after this had been going on for some weeks, one of the cast idly picked up the great man’s paper – he had finished for the day and had gone off to the Garrick Club or somewhere to meet Sir Ralph or someone. Suddenly the actor who had been looking at the paper gasped and showed us the crossword. It was indeed all filled in, but apart from one or two correct answers the rest were just words that happened to fit the spaces and had no bearing on the clues. Needless to say none of us confronted Sir John with the discovery and he continued to complete the Time crossword every day with consummate ease.

I offer this not as a luvvie dropping names and theatrical anecdotes, but as a frustrated Guardian crossword-doer.

Michael Feast

London

• The cryptic crosswords are indeed becoming increasingly difficult and so solvers should not be 2 down on themselves.

Adrian Brodkin

London

• I’m so relieved I’m not the only one struggling with the crosswords. I had blamed the clogging up of the brain cells, because until recently I’ve enjoyed the Guardian’s puzzles for more than 30 years. However, like Margaret Hopkins (Letters, August 24), now I can be confident of completing only those by Rufus and Paul. The other compilers chuck far too much into their clues so that solving them prompts groans of misery not delight. Only Paul has a touch of the wit, elegance and economy of the blessed Araucaria.

Susan Seager

London

• I now start at the bottom right-hand corner, as the clues seem to be easier there. Perhaps the setter is running out of fiendish clues by then, or just wants to get it over and done with. Whatever, it seems to work.

Marjorie Clark

Perth

• I have to say I tend to finish them, albeit after a lot of research and Googling. However, the positioning of the crossword so close to the centrefold of the new puzzle page makes it very difficult to insert the answers in the top line. Very irritating.

Pauline Wilson

Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire

• It’s a relief to know that others are also having trouble finishing the cryptic crosswords. For some time I have been assuring myself that they are getting more difficult, because I didn’t want to face the alternative explanation.

David Fielker

London

• Jean Jackson, please take heart. I not only fail to complete it, I fail to start it.

Ellen Hawley

Crackington Haven, Cornwall

• Having puzzled unsuccessfully over Picaroon’s crossword (24 August), I’m still at a loss with the solution in front of me. Is it time to take up knitting instead?

Pat Moulds

Kiln Hill, Lincolnshire

• Disappointed to see three women (Letters, 23 and 24 August) letting the side down. I also found the newer setters difficult at first but got used to them. Try harder please – unless you want the men saying we don’t have the right brains for cryptic crosswords.

Those of you who have a subscription to The Guardian may have noticed that there were, on Saturday and before, quite a few letters from readers about the level of the newspaper’s cryptic crosswords.

As others may not and as I think this is something perhaps of interest to visitors of Fifteensquared, I thought you might want to have a look here: https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2016/aug/26/cryptic-crosswords-im-sorry-i-havent-a-clue .

Personally, I was really surprised by the mostly negative feelings about The Guardian’s crosswords.

As if it was always easier in the days of (the much missed) Araucaria.

I have uploaded three new sets of photos to Flickr:

The Cruciverbalists’ Convention at The Bridge House, Maida Vale, on 28 January:

Bridge House, 28 January 2012

Part 1 of our celebrations of Rufus’s 80th birthday party, in his local, The Golden Ball, Ironbridge, Saturday 18 February:

Ironbridge, 18 Febuary 2012

Part 2 of the celebrations — at the Guardian offices on Tuesday 21 February:

Rufus’s 80th brithday party, 21 Febuary 2012

At the Guardian party, Rufus was presented with four framed tributes during an address by John Henderson (Enigmatist):

• a copy of Araucaria’s wonderful poem, plus a tribute written by Alan Connor for the Guardian (presented by Don Manley)

• a typeset collection of messages from the Fifteensquared website (presented by me)

• the tribute puzzle from the Financial Times (presented by Colin Inman)

• the tribute Telegraph Toughie puzzle (set by Elkamere, presented by Tom Johnson)

• the tribute puzzle from the Guardian (presented by Arachne, Sarah Hayes)

At the end of last month we had another of those instances where an expert in their field complains that a word was being incorrectly used by a setter, who should have known better. In this case [Letters, Wednesday 1 June], Keith Kirby of Monmouthshire took exception to a Brendan clue (Cryptic No 26,898 for 31 May, 5 across). It was ‘Bottle, or something a Dutchman can get from one’, with the solution COURAGE. The objection was that in cockney rhyming slang ‘bottle’ does not mean ‘courage’. If you did not see the Kirby letter, his case is worth repeating. His assertion was that true cockneys, not wishing to be vulgar, call an ‘arse’ an ‘aris’. (Chambers and Collins give support for this view.) You then move by stages from ‘aris’ to ‘Aristotle’, which rhymes with ‘bottle’, which gives you ‘bottle and glass’, which rhymes with ‘arse’ or ‘ass’ (depending on how you pronounce ‘glass’). Thus, in this version, to ‘lose one’s bottle’ means something like to shit yourself, rather than to lose one’s courage.

Brendan did not need me to spring to his defence, because Mervin Chester from Northampton did so in his letter, published the following day. It pointed out that nowhere in the clue was cockney rhyming slang even hinted at and that the Oxford English Dictionary (no less) defines ‘bottle’ as ‘courage, spirit, guts’, especially in the phrase ‘to lose one’s bottle’, which dates back at least to 1958 and probable derived from the much older term ‘no bottle’, meaning ‘no good’ or ‘useless’, which was current from 1846 at least. So I hope that Mr Kirby will understand that I am not with him on this one, firmly taking the view that what’s good enough for the OED must surely also be good enough for the Guardian.

As those of you who do the crosswords online will already know, some of them have not been appearing on your screens on the due day, including the Quick, the Quiptic and the Observer’s Speedy. We think/hope that the problem has now been solved. To the limited extent that I understand these things, the puzzles were all present and correct on time in the paper’s database but the ‘tool’ that is designed to take stuff from there and use it to update the crossword home page [https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords] was for some reason prevented from doing so. My apologies for all this and my fingers remain firmly crossed. However, if for any reason it (or anything similar) should happen again, there is another route to the puzzles in the database. It is via the option offered at the top left-hand side of the home page to ‘Search archive’. You need to know (or to work out) the serial number of the puzzle you are after. Click there and you will be offered ‘Lookup’. Choose the type of puzzle you want and enter its serial number (without any comma) in the ID box and Bob should be your uncle.

Our ever-thoughtful crossword blogger Alan Connor has teamed up with Boatman and some of his mates to prepare a little extra offering for you for Thursday 23 June, in case you find time hanging heavy on your hands on Referendum Day. I have been shown something of what is scheduled to appear on the website that day and it should excellently serve to keep you safely occupied until after the polls have closed.

Despite severe problems in getting May’s Genius No 155 by Puck up and running properly, there were 28 entries on the first day and 274 by the deadline. Inevitably, the first correct entries were late in arriving but Hook T (a new name in the winners’ enclosure, I think) and Ian with Ocelot were involved in a dead heat at 10:41, with Nigel at goldhill and Geoff M both less than 50 minutes behind them. The first overseas entry was from PS in Australia at 12:00.

Congratulations to John Fowler in Japan, who won the May Genius prize.

Our straw email poll seems to show that solvers are happy with anagrams in the Quicks (in moderation, at least)

My apologies for the length of time since I last gave you an update. I hope that normal service is now restored.

Last time (in March) I asked whether the recent increased appearance of anagrams in the Quick puzzles was generally welcome or not. There were a few responses in the comments online, including an enthusiastic thumbs up on behalf of sardanista’s 8-year-old granddaughter. It seems she enjoys anagrams greatly and, indeed, does most of the other Quick clues as well, provided doing so does not require specialised adult experience.

However, I also received 44 emails in response. This was clearly not a ‘Marmite issue’ (you either love or hate the very British savoury spread made from yeast and vegetable extracts, which is too salty and makes the gums and roof of the mouth sting painfully).

There were 15 emails in the ‘Vote No’ camp, but of these only seven were actual card-carrying, diehard members of the Hate Party. The others said that they were OK, but only if they were much more strictly rationed. By contrast, of the 29 voters supporting the Love Party ticket, 18 could only be described as besotted anagram fans, unable to get enough of the stuff, while the others said that they liked them but perhaps there were too many bunched together.

I shall be sitting down with my advisers shortly to discuss how the data should be interpreted and what policy decisions conclusions should be drawn.

As some of you will already know, Gordon Holt (Otterden) died at the end of April. He started setting puzzles for us in 2013, when he was crossword editor of the New Statesman, to which he continued to contribute. He had a prolonged period of illness and recuperation in 2014 but was then back and in good form. He chose his nom de plume because a holt is the den of an otter. An obit by his friend and collaborator Maskarade was published online on 3 May [see www.theguardian.com/crosswords.2016/may/03/gordon-holt-obituary]. This obit was then also published in the paper itself on 16 May.

There seem to be new names appearing in first-past-the-post prizes in the Genius stakes. I know (though at the time in question I am normally asleep) that there have been continuing problems with the launch of the Genius puzzle in recent months. It is the last Guardian crossword puzzle that still has to be entered ‘manually’ in to the production computer system and, since the Guardian is not willing to pay for someone to sit up overnight just to check the uploading of one puzzle, it takes some time on the first Monday of each month to discover what, if anything, has gone wrong and for the morning shift to find out why it happened and to put it right.

As a result, the March offering by Vlad (No 153) attracted only six correct entries on the first day: M1F at 05:05 and ID@gmail leading the field at 05:05 and 08:44 respectively. There were 212 entries by the deadline and the prize winner was Alan Roberts in New Zealand.

Last month’s puzzle (No 154 by Monk) had 30 entries on the first day with ‘mic’ in Australia first in at 02:06 and the new bookies’ favourite M1F at 02:23. Peter Scrace, also in Australia, won the April prize, as well as being the third correct entry received at 04:2.

Advance notice! Maskarade’s jumbo Easter offering will be published on Saturday 26 March, with the deadline for entries of Friday 1 April and the solution appearing on Monday 4 April.

_____

The main argument last month was provoked by a batch of Quick crosswords where the setter put in clues that involved anagrams of other solutions. Sometimes these also had a second defintions, as in ‘Sign on – 13 (anag) (6)’ for ENLIST, where the solution to 13 across was TINSEL; sometimes they did not, as in ‘6 (anag) (9)’ for BACTERIAL, where the solution to 6 down was CALIBRATE. The reaction, though not as feral as the current exchanges between Conservative Members of Parliament over last week’s budget, pulled no punches. It ranged from saying that it was fun to work on anagrams to saying that anagrams were a cheap, petty, lazy and intensely annoying way of producing Quick puzzles. The problem for the editor is that the engaging exchanges in the comment columns are dominated by a very small proportion of our large solvership and, by definition, may not reflect the views of the silent majority of solvers. So it would be very helpful to have a wider range of views for or against (or expressing indifference either way to) clues based on anagrams, either as a comment under this blog or in an email to me at crossword.editor@theguardian.com.

_____

Speaking of anagrams, from time to time the Crytpic crossword clues used to contain extremely long ones. Some will remember Araucaria’s ‘surprisingly chaste Lord Archer’ for THE OLD VICARAGE, GRANCHESTER, or Paul’s even longer classic that produced four lines from a Spike Milligan poem: THERE ARE HOLES IN THE SKY/WHERE THE RAIN GETS IN,/BUT THEY’RE EVER SO SMALL,/THAT’S WHY RAIN IS THIN.

The downside of their brilliance is that, if you can crack the clue, at one stroke you have got a large part of the puzzle. However, here is a long anagram right up in that class, which has been passed to me and which I offer to you as an early Easter holiday activity.

‘In one of the Bard’s best-thought-of tragedies our insistent hero, Hamlet, queries on two fronts about how life turns rotten (anag) (2,2,2,3,2,2,4,2,3,8,7,3,6,2,3,4,2,6,3,5,3,6,2,10,6)’

The clue is not fully complete and I should be pleased if, having solved what is there, someone was able to take it further.

_____

And, speaking of the Quicks, the debate rumbles on inconclusively about whether they are dumbing down or getting harder. But, for those who find that any particular Quick is completed too quickly and need some way of filling a gap for family or other group, here is a suggestion that was sent to me by Felicity in the Isle of Man. You ask all those who want to play to write a story of 100 words or less, within whatever time limit you choose, that includes all the solution words of that day’s Quick puzzle. Felicity took Quick No 14,211 for 25 November last year and produced:

‘Electra, after one of the ambassador’s dances in Rotterdam, slumbered deeply. Her sycophant sister Tosca, always on the cadge, stole the signet ring, a shining exhibit on Electra’s finger, and, in a fit of peevishness , hid it in the urn of nutmeg … ’ (there was more, but you get the principle of this new game).

You seem to have found the February Genius (No 152 by Enigmatist) quite tough. First in, by a distance was M1F, but not until 04:13. The next pair were Price at 07:45 and PSC in Australia at 07:58. After that there was no entry until 10:30. There were 20 entries on the first day and 237 by the deadline. Congratulations to Tim Francis from Bathampton, who is the winner of the February competition.

Twelve solutions (not further defined) belong to one of two groups (six apples and six pears), which as ‘apples and pears’ are cockney rhyming slang for a flight of stairs ie a LONDON FLIGHT (23,25 across).

The definition part in each of the remaining 16 clues contains a single letter misprint. In clue order, these incorrect letters spell out two locations for another sort of 23,25 across: HEATHROW and STANSTED.

Comments

158 entries, no noticeable mistakes. A clearly welcome return of a firm favourite (for most), only a year since its last appearance, this one (equally clearly) tougher than average. It struck me for the first time that the better PD clues are, the more difficult to solve they become, the break being that much more tricky to spot. I do spend more time than I probably should tinkering with the wording in order to achieve surface reading that is as natural as possible, so completing a PD puzzle takes at least twice as long as a normal plain. And there are always (it seems) a few entries which pose extra problems. Chief among these this time were ATROPOS and SCARAMOUCH, until I was rescued by Suzi Quatro and Pescara (after ages wrestling in vain with Oscar and lascars!). SMEATHS and NACARAT were also tricky to clue, the latter producing rather strained wording. All these obstacles you surmounted eventually, and only one competitor complained of never having heard of ‘Telstar’, that very successful instrumental chart-topper of yesteryear (verifiable on line, I’m sure).

Of the 12 clues cited as favourites, two stood out well ahead of the rest, the winner being ‘What’s that, painted pink? It’s theft!’ (PERT) with four votes more than ‘It’s good to see my old college pesters tarts’ (ALASTRIM).

AZED Slip No. 2,343

Clues submitted fully exploited the many opportunities offered by RESTORE (chosen, of course, with this in mind), and this made my task of picking the best really tough. I don’t expect everyone to share my decision in favour of Mr Leyland’s slightly improper first prizewinner, but I did admire its naturalness in both devilled and undevilled readings, a prime consideration in the judging process and a factor uppermost in the minds, I’m sure, of all the competitors quoted. But I congratulate you all on an extremely high-quality entry.

Comments

218 entries, no mistakes. Favourite clue, of 18 receiving one or more mentions, was (perhaps unsurprisingly) ‘Mawkish bits of Trump speak?’ for TWEETS, a long way ahead of ‘Part of cabin aft is remaining when ——’ (AISLE). And yes, it was a bit mischievous giving you TRUMP to clue. Only after I’d chosen it did I see that Will Drever had chosen DONALD TRUMP for the cluing competition in a recent issue of the Crossword Club magazine, though that of course presented a different challenge, not least because of the many lexical meanings offered by the single word. Few if any of the clues submitted suggested that the Donald has any support among Azed competitors. I hope you all share my fervent hope that Mr Wardrop’s winner proves prophetic, and the sooner the better. Meanwhile we wait in nervous trepidation for the effect his style of presidency will have on global affairs. (There was of course no obligation to involve DT as the definition in your clue, though the great majority found this irresistible.)

Anyway, I had a lot of fun going through your submissions (one or two of them virtually unprintable!). The challenge was to produce a clue which wasn’t too obvious, and many of those not mentioned above fell into this category, though otherwise sound enough. The abbreviation POTUS, which I’d not previously come across, turned up several times.

A couple of regulars kindly responded to my recent appeal (in the MASON slip) for an explanation of the phrase ‘on the square’ in connection with membership of the Freemasons. It seems that the square referred to is an L-shaped instrument (a set-square?) used by stonemasons to assess the squareness of cut stones: ‘in order to support all the blocks around it, each stone block needs to be perfectly straight and all angles right angles’. So the phrase refers to the trust and support masons lend each other: a man who is ‘on the square’ is honest, reliable and firm. How the phrase differs in meaning from the similar ‘on the level’ is less clear, though doubtless masons know.

ALLELUIAH

1 D. F. Manley (26 Hayward Road, Oxford OX2 8LW): Response from us all in the aisles, reborn with wretched sins set aside? (anag. less anag. & lit.).

134 entries, a dozen or so with GNAR for SNAR and rather more whose clues were disqualified as they did not begin with an R. I thought the acrostic would be easy to spot, and certainly didn’t mean it to cause undue puzzlement. It was merely to give you a little extra challenge as a way of marking my ‘sapphire’ moment. (John Tozer tells me he’s estimated the total number of competition entries over the period to be 191,493, ‘which probably puts the total entries for all puzzles close to a million’.) Favourite clue, of 15 mentioned, was ‘On a slope in Scotland I set off to whizz downhill fast?’ for ASKLENT, with ‘One cheers to know Mafeking remained so’ (UNTAKEN) in second place. Thank you for all the generous comments appended to your entries. Many of you have been solving and competing since Azed No. 1 in 1972, and this in itself gives me great satisfaction and pleasure.

Some said they found the puzzle unusually difficult, doubtless the reason for the low entry. As often, I think it was the short words that caused the most difficulty. Topical variations on the ‘All hail, EU’ anagram were so common that only a few were distinctive enough to make it into the quoted lists. In general, though, you coped well with a fairly unfriendly word.

With the death of Colin Dexter we have lost another distinguished member of the Old Guard. Until poor health and failing eyesight forced him to give up entering, he had been one of the most successful competitors in Azed, and earlier Ximenes, competitions, especially as a master of the ‘& lit’ clue. Since his first appearance in the slips in February 1957, he won 71 prizes (40 of them firsts) and 237 VHCs. If I had to pick a favourite from among his clues it would probably be ‘Item gran arranged family slides in’ for MAGIC LANTERN, a model of concision and wit. Colin’s obituarists have understandably focussed mainly on his hugely successful crime fiction, set in and around Oxford where as a near neighbour I got to know him and Dorothy as good friends. But in the crossword world (as competitor, author, broadcaster and sometime setter (he was Codex in the Oxford Times) he fully earned his place as one of the all-time greats and will be sadly missed.

BRAZEN/MOPISH

170 entries, no mistakes. I’m really very sorry about the wrong numbering throughout the puzzle grid. Regulars clearly realized what had happened, and how. It was all OK on the proof I checked and passed, before some agency, human or (more likely) electronic, intervened to change it to something more ‘logically’ correct. Less experienced solvers must have been bemused until the correct grid was shown the following week, albeit far too small. All this was going on while I was abroad on holiday, gnashing my teeth in helpless frustration. I’m very grateful to those who did what they could to tidy up the mess in my absence (especially DFM). I should add that most of you did not mention the fiasco at all, and those that did did so with great forbearance and good humour.

Favourite clue by far, of 12 nominated at least once, was ‘I’ll have a large one, with a dash of Dubonnet, like the rest here’ for DOUBLE-FORMED; of the double clues, joint favourites were ‘Ivy delivering song that includes a line writer set in cunning bit of old France’ (ARALIA/ARPENT) and ‘Strong gents maybe with a special style play ace after a tipple’ (FLAVA/DRAMA).

Most of you coped well with the special problems double clues present, but it’s worth mentioning again the main things to bear in mind when constructing one (in no special order): (i) the whole clue should make some sort of coherent sense; (ii) the join between the two separate component clues should be well disguised, ideally without intervening punctuation; (iii) there should be no superfluous words between the two parts added solely to improve the verbal flow; (iv) each clue of the pair should be complete in itself (even if it may not make complete syntactical sense individually) without any reference from one to the other which would be meaningless when each is viewed in isolation; (v) the division between component clues should not occur in the middle of a word in the clue as a whole; (vi) double clues should be as short as possible within these general guidelines. (Spare a thought for the judge!)

A final word of caution and one I’ve mentioned before, though the message has still not got home completely. I don’t accept that ‘extremely’ can be used in a clue to indicate the first and last letters of the relevant word or phrase. This does not seem to me to come within any of the normal senses of the word.

Comments

201 entries, a small handful with TAGINE for TAJINE, another of those alternative spellings that Chambers annoyingly fails to give a dummy entry of its own with an appropriate cross-reference. There are far too many of these in C. for my liking. Favourite clue, of 14 mentioned, was ‘Err with maid getting knocked up? Did the honest thing maybe’ (MARRIED), which just pipped ‘Teacher flipped about producer of bad spelling, bursting blood vessel?’ (RHEXIS), in what was very much a two-horse contest. My MARRIED clue was variously described as ‘one of Azed’s naughties’ and ‘more Private Eye than Observer’. I hope no one was too shocked by it.

No doubt MASON has been clued many times, by others as well as by me, but I can’t recall seeing any of the clues quoted above before. I expected, and got, quite a few variations on the ‘mother and child’ approach, some referring to the Simon & Garfunkel song ‘Mother and child reunion’ though the idea of their being reunited seemed inappropriate and irrelevant here. I know little about the bizarre rituals observed by Freemasons beyond the oft-told tales of trouser-legs and funny handshakes, but although they belong to lodges I don’t think they are ever referred to as ‘lodgers’, are they? And can anyone explain to me why being ‘on the square’ (new to me before this competition) refers to membership of Freemasonry? Some floor design perhaps.

I’m grateful to the two regulars who tracked down the Ximenes puzzle I referred to in the last slip but one, in which alcoholic drinks had to be replaced by non-alcoholic ones. X entitled it ‘On the Wagon’ and it was reproduced in The Penguin Book of Ximenes Crossword Puzzles (1972) though when it first appeared in The Observer (during Lent, one surmises) is unclear. X died in 1971.

Comments

234 entries, virtually no mistakes (one regular unable to find the unlikely-looking B(R)ANSLES). Favourite clue (of 20 nominees): ‘Regular feature of R. Stein restaurant in sink he redesigned’ for FISH KNIFE (still a non-U term?).

As a Christmas diversion this was clearly much enjoyed, to judge from the many appreciative comments. As many of you also surmised it was a tough grid to construct, and I was forced to restart my first attempt from scratch when I found I couldn’t complete it. I have actually used this idea three times before (always at Christmas). Previous code phrases have been XWORD YULE GIFT, A TRICKY BOXFUL and XMAS QUIZ BLOCK; it may be difficult to think of any more that are appropriate and don’t repeat words already used. This time I made it extra-tough for myself by having all the vowels in the code phrase, i.e. with all the ‘difficult’ letters in the down words. As most of you realized, I had to omit Q from the Playfair square because the code phrase included both I and J, It certainly wasn’t the first time this has happened, in both Azed and Ximenes series. As for AH JOYFUL TIMES (which one competitor suggested might have been chosen with a touch of irony – what, moi?), I was interested to be told that the phrase occurs in Handley Cross, or The Spa Hunt by R. S. Surtees: ‘Ah, joyful times that the recollection of that ceremony must awaken! It will rewive the wision of our buoyish [sic] days, and make us fancy ourselves young again!’, referring not to Christmas but to the blooding of a youngster at a fox hunt.

CELEBRATIONS proved a highly productive word to clue, offering for one thing, an almost limitless number of possible anagrams, many of them naturally suitable at Christmas-time, and I was truly delighted by the range of your ingenuity. If there was one (quite popular) idea I was less than enthusiastic about it was including wordplay leading to CELEB(S), too close etymologically, I thought, to the target word and therefore a little weak in cluing terms.

To end on a sad note, I have just heard of the death of Mrs D. B. (Dot) Jenkinson, after quite a long illness. She had been a keen solver and competitor for many years, a regular at Azed gatherings, and latterly a good friend of me and my family. The comments she included with her entries were always witty and not a little quirky. She had an encyclopedic knowledge of films, especially those pre-dating the computer-assisted era, and was something of an authority on the life and works of R. L. Stevenson. A delightful person, whom I shall miss greatly.

Comments

143 entries, no mistakes. The low entry must have been due to the fact that the wrong rubric was printed with the puzzle, for which I apologize. Regulars realized what had happened and sent their entries to the PO box as usual. There was a fair number of ‘clueless’ entries submitted to The Observer, and non-competition prizes went to the three lucky winners from this group. It seemed the fairest way of dealing with this regrettable lapse, which I hope won’t happen again. Thank you for your forbearance. Favourite clue, of 18 receiving one or more votes, was ‘Like a damp squib? Hate it going off cold after 6th of November’ (BATHETIC), just ahead of ‘Bother includes this for new parent – it’s bottomless’ for ABYSM, a sort of extended Printer’s Devilry clue.

VENTRICOSE offered a wealth of possibilities, including a friendly set of letters and a definition which could be played around with in all manner of ways. Corsets and corporations were understandably much in evidence. Several competitors spoiled their chances by defining it as a noun. I’ve mentioned this often before, but is essential that the wording of your clue should clearly and unequivocally indicate the part of speech of the target word. Solvers have a right to expect no less. One perfectly sound clue which won no prizes but made me laugh, with its echoes of the boyfriend of Samantha, the score-keeper on I’m Sorry I Haven’t a Clue who is never heard from but always the butt of smutty double entendres, was ‘Sven, erotic, overwrought, overweight’.

With the Christmas competition still to judge, I will close my comments by thanking all who sent seasonal greetings and/or cards to me and my family. It is so good to hear that my puzzles continue to provide a pleasurable challenge. Best wishes for the new year to you all, and happy solving in 2017.

Comments

122 entries, and several mistakes. It’s clear that I badly misjudged the puzzle’s level of difficulty; many of you commented on how tough they found it, though plenty said how much they’d enjoyed the challenge. To my surprise, spotting the theme proved elusive for many (despite the title, which I’d assumed would be a dead give-away) and for some the penny never dropped at all: some entries had TIMENOJENNY and there was even one TIMENOKENNY. I was quite pleased at having managed to work so many thematic entries into the 13 x 13 grid, though I can see that identifying some of the boys’ names whose omission left only one or two of the letters of the original defined answers must have been tricky. EHEBEE for EPAULE, with two rather crucial unchecked letters, defeated quite a few. I know Hebe isn’t in the Names appendix in Chambers, but she does have her own entry in the body of the dictionary. Both OLEO/OMARIE and VIANDS/VBESSDS also claimed a few scalps. NICKEL, with its normal clue, was an unintentional red herring. And though no one actually mentioned (or noticed?) it, it gave me special pleasure to include the names of both my sons, TOM and NED. Favourite clue was ‘Swans turning muter beside one on board ship’ for TRUMPETERS/TRUMESMES.

Have I used this idea before? I honestly can’t remember, though I do seem to recall a Ximenes competition puzzle from long ago in which alcoholic drinks were to be replaced by non-alcoholic ones (or possibly vice versa). Can anyone give chapter and verse? I still think it’s quite a nice idea, exploitable in different ways, but perhaps the solver needs more help than I gave this time. I could for instance have given the lengths of thematic answers before treatment, but this of course would in many cases have revealed which clues were thematic, which I didn’t really want to do. The very low entry seems to indicate that I was wrong.

All that having been said, you still came up with some excellent clues. I hope the three prizewinners don’t offend any of you or lead you to suppose that the judge has a one-track mind, but few others went for this approach and it did tickle my sense of humour.

Advance warning that the Christmas competition puzzle will appear on 18 December, closing date 31 December. There will be no issue of The Observer on Christmas Day.

Comments

183 entries, some mistakes. The first of these was caused by not spotting that ‘Man!’ can mean ‘How surprising!’ in the clue to ZAMAN, with ZAMIA also being a tree. (But I would never use ‘surprising’ to indicate an anagram, surely stretching its meaning too far.) The other error was CIDER for CYDER, despite my hint in the clue as the spelling required: ‘One heading left or right, we hear, for strong drink (beware second!)’. Failure to see how the clue to GOOLY worked (go (to p)oly) added to the confusion, no doubt. Favourite clue, of 21 nominated at least once, was ‘Take ill? Doctor enters’ (RESENT), with ‘Spring, time to follow love in frivolity’ (FOUNT) one vote behind.

Perhaps surprisingly, GLOBETROTTER proved tricky to clue well, though I guess it was the first word to occur from the asterisked definition. This can of course happen from to time, but I’m not averse to giving you an easy start, even when, as many of you commented, the puzzle as a whole is seen as easier than average (though there are always some taking the opposite view!). It was perhaps inevitable that David Jason and Only Fools and Horses should prove popular. His catchphrase as used in Mr Smailes’s VHC is on the borderline of acceptability as a definition, but I found it too funny to resist. A few of you resorted to ‘Lemon’ as a definition, with reference to the enticingly named Meadowlark Lemon, a star player, I learn, in the Harlem Globetrotters. I judged this as on the wrong side of familiarity to earn high marks, my guess being that it would fail to pass as acceptable by crossword editors in other papers. I have to make such judgements unaided, being subjected to no such scrutiny by the Observer, so it interests me to read recent correspondence in the Guardian about the perceived increase in difficulty of its crosswords of late. I suspect this results from the desire among regular setters to push back the boundaries of ‘crypticity’ rather than from any deliberate intention to make life more difficult for solvers. My own aim is always to maintain a consistent standard of difficulty, but innovative approaches will inevitably occur from time to time. Your reactions usually tell me when I’ve gone too far!

Comments

143 entries, a few with KANTAR for CANTAR. Favourite clue, of 18 mentioned , was ‘Hill fort, not badly fortified initially, sacked from end to end’ for THRO (RATH), with those for NAYWARD (PSALTER) and ONE-TIME (TOTTIES) coming joint second. Two competitors queried my use of the (sexist) singular ‘skirt’ as the definition for TOTTIES, though Chambers supports this collective usage (cf. ‘crumpet’).

WN puzzles are tricky to handle, certainly for the setter, but also no doubt for the solver, which I guess accounts for the low entry. The complicated preamble probably deters the casual solver from competing, and there were more than a few who picked the wrong word(s) to clue. That said, it presents an interestingly different challenge, which several of you said they greatly enjoyed. Over the years I’ve set 12 WNs as competitions and plenty more as non-competition puzzles. Ximines (whose idea I think it was originally) set five as competitions, the first being his No. 209. According to JRT, ‘It was a great hit with solvers, and the main fault in clue-writing was not, as expected, cluing the wrong word, but failing to make the locating definition integral to the clue.’ The same fault (which indicates failure to appreciate the main challenge WN poses) still occurs.

My method when cluing a WN puzzle is to group words by length (ideally six groups of six) and to jot down as many one-word definitions for each entry as possible. (Indications of currency, register, etc are naturally not possible unless an exact equivalent can be found.) Clues and ‘imported’ definitions are then paired off one by one. It is of course helpful to fill the grid in the first place with words that have several senses, and I gave you AGREE (PATCH) with this in mind. Possibly the range of choice was too wide, but I felt this was a fault on the right side.

Many congratulations to Messrs Barley and Heald for sharing the top spot in the annual honours list, and to everyone on the list for consistency over the course of the year. Competition at the highest level, as I’ve said before, is still as keen as ever.

And here’s an interesting footnote, from a comment by a competitor. Some Shakespeare scholars have suggested that in the familiar line from Hamlet, ‘I know a hawk from a handsaw’, the bard really meant ‘heronshaw’, which would certainly make more sense, even though Hamlet is feigning madness at the time.

Labour’s female MPs are planning to operate as a parliamentary bloc to force Theresa May’s minority government to pass policies beneficial to women across Britain.



The 119-strong group has been emboldened by the success of Stella Creasy’s Queen’s speech amendment, which paved the way for women in Northern Ireland to be given free access to NHS abortions.

All the female MPs in Jeremy Corbyn’s party now plan to use the strength of their bloc in a variety of policy areas. These include:

Heavy scrutiny of the domestic violence bill that the government promised to bring forward in the Queen’s speech.

Pressing for social security reform to support female recipients.

Ensuring that women are central to the government’s industrial strategy.

Focusing on the experience of carers, older women needing care, and those working in the industry.

Pushing for increased representation, particularly in local government.

Jess Phillips, chair of the women’s parliamentary Labour party (PLP), said the bloc was bigger than most others in Westminster and would have particular power in a hung parliament.



“The women’s PLP is 119 strong; as a group we dwarf the 10 DUP [Democratic Unionist] MPs,” she said. “We will be using our collective voices to push for the things that we know matter to women in the UK.”

Phillips said Creasy’s amendment showed how opposition MPs could effect change in a finely balanced parliament. Creasy, the Walthamstow MP, argued that it was wrong that Northern Irish women could receive medical care, such as an appendectomy, for free on the NHS on the mainland, but not an abortion. Raising the issue as the Tories secured a confidence and supply deal with the DUP, Creasy was able to secure the support of Conservative backbenchers, forcing the prime minister to act.

Phillips said: “We will be using our power to make sure that the voices and concerns of women in the UK are never forgotten. We have seen the Tories co-opt policies such as a domestic violence bill and a separate commissioner, which have been Labour policies for many years thanks to the efforts of Labour women in changing the agenda.

“In the hung parliament we intend to use our voices to keep pushing for change.”

Foreign secretary suggests he might like to follow US president’s approach to Twitter, saying it has gripped imaginations

Boris Johnson has suggested he wishes he could tweet like Donald Trump, and praised the way the US president has drawn people into politics.

In an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the foreign secretary intimated he was envious of the freedom with which Trump expressed his views on Twitter, despite the intense criticism the president has faced on his use of the network.

Boris Johnson backs away from call for public sector pay cap to be lifted - Politics live Read more

He said: “Donald Trump’s approach to politics has been something that has gripped the imagination of people around the world. He has engaged people in politics in a way that we haven’t seen for a long time, with his tweets and all the rest of it.

“I certainly wouldn’t be allowed to tweet in the way that he does, much as I might like to. I’m seeing my Foreign Office minders looking extremely apprehensive here.”



The timing of Johnson’s remarks might explain why his aides were looking so anxious. Criticism of Trump’s use of Twitter reached new intensity in the last week after he launched a crude attack on TV host Mika Brzezinski, whom he described as “bleeding badly” from a facelift.

Johnson claimed the UK had been a restraining influence on Trump. He said: “We in the UK do not agree, by any means, with everything that Washington currently says.

“It is very important to understand that when Theresa May goes to meet the president today, as she will in Hamburg … our role is to represent our own point of view.

“Whether it’s on Nato, climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, it is the UK that is actually helping, we think, to mitigate, to get some of those American attitudes and policies that are currently coming out of the White House into a better place. If you look at the last 12 months or so there has been a great deal of progress.”

Johnson’s apparent envy of Trump’s candour overshadowed his loyal remarks about the prime minister later in the interview and his attempts to row back on his call for the public sector pay cap to be lifted.

This week a senior government source told the Guardian Johnson was adding to cabinet appeals for the 1% ceiling on wage rises to be lifted. But in his BBC interview Johnson evaded the question of whether the cap should be lifted.

Chilcot: Tony Blair was not 'straight with the nation' over Iraq war Read more

He said: “What I think, and I know my friend the chancellor thinks, is there has got to be a balance in all this. You can’t endlessly borrow, you can’t endlessly spend.

“The country has done well to cut the deficit by three-quarters in the way that we have and that leads to huge economic benefits … It is very very important that you manage your economy sensibly and don’t just go for a crazy Corbynite splurge.”

Pressed on the issue, he added: “As Philip Hammond has also said … we recognise that people are weary of restraint. We recognise that when the public sector pay review bodies report we will obviously be wanting to look at their thinking very carefully.

“Every sensible government wants to make sure that people have a well-paid secure job, that is what we want to achieve, but we have got to achieve that in a way that is fiscally sensible and responsible.”

Asked about his leadership ambitions, Johnson said there was “no vacancy” and he complemented May on the way she had recovered since the election.

He said: “There was a Conservative party event last night. Theresa May gave a fantastic speech. I was watching her and thinking what unbelievable grace and steel she has shown over the last few weeks.

“The thing did not frankly look too brilliant on the morning of June 9th. It looked very difficult. She has put things back together, she has got the show on road, she is delivering a stable government as she said she would ,and we are getting on with it.”



Johnson said a Tory leadership race was “the last thing people want”. He added: “What they want to see is a long period of stability and calm and progress for the British people that will enable us to start to deliver.”

On North Korea, Johnson urged China to do more to intervene after Pyongyang’s successful intercontinental ballistic missile test. He said: “What the North Koreans are doing is reckless, it’s indefensible, it’s in defiance of repeated UN resolutions, it is illegal and it’s very important that the world stands together against what they are doing.

“The country with the most direct economic relationship with North Korea, that is China, has got to continue to put on the pressure. We are seeing some real changes in Beijing’s attitude to North Korea and that has got to go further.”

The foreign secretary also said the UK was trying to “dial things down” in the feud between Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

Russia’s president may use Friday’s meeting in Hamburg to get the measure of his US counterpart – and consider possibilities for finding common ground

When George W Bush first met Vladimir Putin in 2001, the frosty encounter unexpectedly warmed up after the two bonded over the story of a silver cross that Putin’s mother had given him. Bush declared that he had “looked the man in the eye” and got a “sense of his soul”.

Russia is hoping for a similar personal breakthrough when Donald Trump meets Putin for the first time as world leaders at the G20 summit in Hamburg on Friday. Relations between the US and Russia are now riven by even more political differences than in 2001, but the two leaders’ kind words for each other in the past suggest the possibility of developing a rapport.

“This is the first meeting, the first acquaintance of the two presidents. This is the main thing for this meeting,” Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists on Wednesday.

In a similar vein, the state television spin doctor Dmitry Kiselyov – whose criticisms of the US are matched only by his appreciation of Trump – declared on his Sunday night show that the most Russia can hope for from the meeting is that “they get to know each other and agree to meet again”.

According to the analyst Fyodor Lukyanov, political battles over Russia-related issues in Washington are likely to make significant agreements impossible, but the meeting will give Putin a chance to take the measure of his US counterpart.

“He can get a personal impression and try to understand whether something will change in the future,” he said. According to Lukyanov, the Kremlin is “perplexed” by Trump because it’s not clear what his priorities are nor whether he can work with Congress to achieve them.

For Moscow, the biggest stumbling blocks in the relationship with Washington are the sanctions first imposed over Russia’s intervention in Ukraine, and expanded last month as punishment for its meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

But the Kremlin has said in the past it would wait for Washington to cancel them of its own accord rather than lobby for their removal – and with the US Congress determined to keep up pressure on Russia as long as the conflict in Ukraine drags on, little progress is likely to be made on this issue in Hamburg.

According to the Russian foreign ministry, the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria will be on the agenda for Putin and Trump’s sit-down, but any attempts at cooperation in these countries will surely be fraught.

The US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, lobbied against extending sanctions, telling Congress that the United States shouldn’t be “handcuffed” to the Minsk agreements Russia is accused of failing to meet.

But the Senate’s 97-2 vote last month to approve new sanctions torpedoed Moscow’s hopes of a softer stance on Ukraine, where it has backed pro-Russian separatists.

Possibilities for US-Russian cooperation in Syria have also dimmed after the Khan Sheikhun chemical weapons attack and Trump’s ensuing cruise missile strikes on Russia’s ally Bashar al-Assad.

Instead of focusing on such hot-button issues, Putin could try to work toward a few concrete, smaller objectives that would nonetheless be seen as a huge victory domestically were he to achieve them.

First among these is the return of Russian diplomatic compounds in New York and Maryland that Barack Obama said were used in intelligence gathering and closed down in response to the 2016 election interference.

The Russian foreign ministry pushed these facilities back into the spotlight by suddenly declaring last week that it was preparing “retaliatory measures” over their closure. In addition, a Russian embassy Twitter account said US facilities in Russia would be closed if Washington failed to restore them.

White House could offer to roll back sanctions in first Trump-Putin meeting Read more

The return of the two compounds was reportedly among the “deliverables” Trump ordered aides to prepare ahead of his meeting with Putin, although the idea of offering such concessions has met fierce resistance in the state department and Congress.

“It’s seemingly a minor issue, but for Russia it’s very important as an indicator,” the analyst Alexei Makarkin said. “If [Trump] is unable to reach an agreement with Russia about these buildings, then Russia will be disappointed and skeptical of what other agreements it can reach with him.”

Another item Moscow has attempted to put back on the agenda before the meeting is the case of Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot who was arrested in a US-led drug bust in Liberia and sentenced to 20 years in prison for conspiring to smuggle $100m of cocaine into the United States. The deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov told Izvestia newspaper on Monday that the United States had again denied Russia’s request to transfer Yaroshenko to his homeland.

“This is among the key topics in our list of unsolved problems in relations, as is a whole set of questions about illegal actions by American law enforcement organs,” Ryabkov said.

If the two leaders do delve into more geopolitical questions, Putin will probably try to focus on issues on which Washington lawmakers could more conceivably cooperate. A Putin aide said this week that terrorism and nuclear weapons could be discussed.

The issue of strategic parity has long been gnawing at the Kremlin, especially after the United States activated a missile defense shield in Romania last year and began installing another one in Poland. Putin has argued the defense shield could be quickly modified into an offensive weapons system, calling it a “threat” to which Russia was “obliged to take action in response to guarantee our security”.

For its part, Moscow has deployed a nuclear-tipped cruise missile banned by the seminal 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, US administration officials said in February. The reported violation has led to growing pressure on Trump to walk away from the accord, a move that many experts say could spark an arms race. Trump said in February he would bring up the issue with Putin when the two met.

Moscow has stood behind the treaty. A US exit from the deal could trigger an “arms race and precisely nobody stands to win from that”, Viktor Shamanov, head of the defense committee in parliament, warned last month. Vladimir Leontyev, deputy arms control head at the foreign ministry, said the United States leaving the deal would be a “big mistake” that would greatly raise military tensions in Europe.

A thinktank led by the former finance minister Alexei Kudrin, on whom Putin still occasionally relies for advice, said in a report last month that Russia not only should try to preserve the INF accord, but also work out a new nuclear arms reduction treaty with Washington.

In a symbolic message to Putin and Trump, the sculptor Alexander Burganov unveiled a statue of Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in Moscow on Monday to commemorate their work to cut nuclear arsenals under the INF treaty.

An official from the Russian foreign ministry attended the ceremony, which featured Russian singers struggling with English-language songs such as My Country, ’Tis of Thee and a musical ode to Gorbachev. The US embassy in Moscow was not represented.

The organiser Edward Lozansky, a lobbyist who has promoted ties between Russia and the American right, said the ceremony was meant as a warning about the “dangerous state in relations” that could allow any run-in between ships or aircraft to quickly escalate.

“We want to send a message to Trump and Putin to go back and see how Reagan and Gorbachev were able to go from escalation, from the threat of nuclear war, to finding some common language,” he said.

The world’s 20 biggest economic powers are about to gather in Hamburg for a two-day summit pondering whether they should still look to the US for global leadership.

The summit, ostensibly about financial stability, could mark the moment of the US’s formal abdication as the world’s pre-eminent power. The task of leadership will be seen to be passed not to a single successor – a reluctant China is not ready – but to a new unstable quartet of Donald Trump, Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, and Angela Merkel.



This contest for world leadership could not come at a worse time. Too many lights are flashing red on the global dashboard: climate change, North Korea, world trade, Ukraine, mass migration and discord in the Gulf. Yet the quartet comes to the summit, starting on Thursday night, with very different aims.



Merkel, the serene host, had planned to use it to lift the world’s gaze to the long-term challenge posed by migration from an increasingly populated and youthful Africa but instead finds herself firefighting.

She will meet Trump on Thursday night in an effort to reacquaint him with her plan for Africa and to test how far he is willing to be more malleable than he was at the G7, notably on climate change. Merkel is not keen on being leader of the liberal west, describing such labels as “grotesque” and choosing to be seen in the constant company of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to dilute the impression of German dominance of Europe.

But she also knows she can play considerate host only so far when she meets Trump. Martin Schulz, her social Democratic rival for chancellor in September’s election is looking for a chink in her electoral armour, and believes he has found one by being more strident in his criticisms of Trump. Polls show there is no downside to being rude about Trump: some 80% of Germans have no or little confidence in his ability to be a force for good in the world, according to a recent Pew Research poll.

Trump in turn continues to attack the German trade surplus, ridicule climate change, mull curbs on German steel imports and insist global politics is a Darwinian battle in which each leader must think first and only of their national interest.

The US president even appeared to be spoiling for a row with his hosts. “The US made some of the worst trade deals in world history. Why should we continue these deals with countries that do not help us”, he wrote on Twitter on Wednesday morning.

Merkel has been equally firm in her reply, saying that “anyone who believes that the problems of this world can be solved with isolationism and protectionism is making a terrible error”. She will be able to back those words up by pointing to the signing of a free trade deal between Japan and the EU, a signal that the free trading world will hold to its beliefs and, if necessary, work around the US.

She also intends to emphasise her claim that the rest of the world is more determined than ever to make the Paris climate change treaty a success despite Trump’s announcement of US withdrawal.

Trump will be unconcerned if he is outnumbered since it will only deepen his narrative of America as a victim, a story that works with his political base. His focus will be on his meeting with Vladimir Putin on Friday.

Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the former British foreign secretary, likened the event to “two alpha males prowling around one another”, admitting the potential outcome kept him awake at night. “It is a huge problem that Putin cannot predict how Trump is going to behave,” he said, adding: “That is because Trump does not know how he is going to behave.”

No agreement is expected on Ukraine, but on Syria Trump is likely to signal that the fate of Assad is of little concern after the defeat of Isis.

But any kind of concessions to Moscow will be seen in the context of Trump’s strange inability to call out Russian interference in the US presidential elections. To dwell on Russian meddling risks delegitimising his victory, yet the controversy has left him powerless to pursue the policy with Moscow he once intended.

Putin will want a signal that he is seen as a legitimate player in world politics by Trump. He will also want Trump to show he disapproves of the US Senate voting to extend sanctions against Russia.

Trump’s meeting with Putin may not end up being the most-watched event in Hamburg, however. After North Korea’s announcement on Tuesday that it had successfully tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile, Trump’s planned huddle with Xi is likely to be a lot frostier than their first encounter in April.

His faith in China to act tough with North Korea appears to have evaporated and before the summit’s opening, he will meet with Shinzo Abe, of Japan, and Moon Jae-in, of South Korea. Trump is sure to vent his frustration at China’s refusal to cut off energy supplies to North Korea, a move China fears would prompt a mass exodus. If there was a simple solution, it would have been tried by now.

Yet Xi is not at this summit to act as a bystander. He has marked himself out as an ally to Merkel, stressing how much he agrees with her on free trade and climate change. He will urge the US to show restraint on North Korea, and even if he has lost the ear of Washington, he does not believe the US will act without his agreement.

This may not be the summit for him to try to fill the US’s shoes, but the moment is coming.

Experts fear that Monday’s launch demonstrates Alaska is within the regime’s firing range, but many locals say their concerns are closer to home

Alaska’s leaders say North Korea’s test of intercontinental missiles proves the need for beefed-up missile defense in this frontier state. That’s the politicians, anyway. Many Alaskans say they’re more worried about bears than bombs.

“I was surprised they were able to get a missile to actually launch,” physician Robert Church said Thursday as he parked his mountain bike at a popular Anchorage park. Cottonwood seeds drifted to the grass all around him. “I’m concerned about the threat, but I don’t have a lot of confidence in the North Korea scientists making a functional rocket that could reach Alaska.”

Experts say the Tuesday launch demonstrated the ability of North Korea to put Alaska within firing range. Alaskans like 45-year-old Church, who grew up during the cold war, living closer to Russia than to the continental United States, have heard it all before.

“The Russians would come and we’d chase them off and shit. We’d scramble some planes,” said 40-year-old delivery driver David Brandt. He sat behind the wheel of a Ford F150 across town from the park, knocking ashes from his cigarette.

Certainly other Alaska problems feel more immediate. Governor Bill Walker spent the morning surveying flood damage to homes and properties in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley. Amid a pair of fatal black bear maulings, an opioid epidemic and a cratering state economy, the North Korea threat is just one of many worries making headlines in the state.

Walker said North Korea’s efforts highlight the need to “expand armed forces” here, including a strategic Arctic port.



“Given our proximity to growing foreign powers, and this week’s test, that need is now more urgent than ever,” he said on Thursday through a spokeswoman.

Meanwhile, Alaska’s only congressman, Don Young, is pushing legislation that would authorize an additional 28 ground-based interceptors southeast of Fairbanks.

“The recent actions by North Korea, a rogue and irrational regime, underscores the importance of the Alaska’s missile defense systems, including interceptors at Fort Greely, Alaska, and the future long range discrimination radar at Clear Air Force Station,” a Young spokesman said.

And Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, called the missile test a “matter of grave concern” and warned against complacency.



The test came as many Alaskans were distracted by hunting, fishing and fireworks over the holiday weekend. Mike McIntyre, a Yup’ik musician, took his kids to a parade in the rural hub city of Bethel, about 40 miles from the Bering Sea.

“Scary,” McIntyre said of the North Korea threat. Those living in remote communities like Bethel feel as if they there are on the frontlines of any conflicts with foreign powers, he said. Particularly as sea ice disappears, increasing accessibility to northern areas.

“The Arctic Ocean ice has kind of opened up there and they could sail right to us,” McIntyre said.

In another riverside town, Paul Apfelbeck of Galena said random thoughts crossed his mind when he heard of the missile tests. Doesn’t he live next to a former second world war-era military airfield? he mused.

“I was wondering about being on some old map and having the North Koreans use it as a demonstration shot,” he said.



In a sprawling state where life is on pause during the sun-drenched summer days, news of the missile test has been slow to reach some village and community leaders.

“I never heard anything about [the missile test],” said Cassandra Ahkvaluk, a teacher’s aide in the tiny Bering Strait village of Little Diomede. The hillside town is on an island just two miles across the international boundary line from Russia.

Ahkvaluk, a former city mayor in the community of 118 people, says she’s too young to remember the cold war. As for North Korea, their missiles didn’t even rate water-cooler gossip this week. Her neighbors are busy gathering murre eggs and greens, hunting seal and walrus, she said.



Everything else seems so far away. “I don’t know what to think,” Ahkvaluk said.

Back at the busy public park in Anchorage, 30-year-old Alyssa Wehrli thumbed her phone as kids crawled inside a rocket-shaped playground slide.

“It’s always been concerning that Alaska is an easy target for our enemies,” Wehrlie said. “If it’s going to happen, it’s going to happen.”

She avoided news of North Korea, she said, but did hear about the unusual bear attack that killed a runner on a trail just down the highway. Everybody worried and talked about that.

“They just pose a more immediate threat,” she said.

Footage of Marian Lukasik’s comments at far-right group’s rally in Birmingham has been viewed thousands of times

A prominent Britain First supporter has advocated gunning down Angela Merkel because of Germany’s policy of allowing Muslim refugees to settle in Europe.

Marian Lukasik, a far-right activist, said the German chancellor should be shot “to pieces” after allowing Syrian and Iraqi people to enter Germany.

Footage of his comments has been uploaded to YouTube as part of an interview which has been viewed thousands of times.

It comes days after a man, reportedly with rightwing views, was charged with planning to assassinate the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and one year on from the murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox, who was killed by a far-right activist who shouted “Britain First” before shooting and stabbing her.

Lukasik, 61, a Polish national who lives in Enfield, north London, made his comments while attending a Britain First rally in Birmingham last month. He was interviewed for more than 20 minutes by a Polish blogger, Weronika Kania, and asked for his opinion on Merkel’s immigration policy.

Lukasik replied in Polish: “Let comrade Mauser speak” – an apparent reference to a Russian semi-automatic pistol – before imitating the sound and miming the action of a firing gun for several seconds. He then said: “Shoot her into pieces. This is the only solution. If this whore remains in charge it will just get worse. There will be terrorist attacks and so on.”

According to the Criminal Law Act 1977, a person who makes a threat to kill, intending that others would fear it would be carried out, can face a sentence of up to 10 years.

After being urged to calm down by another man at the rally, Lukasik said: “I will go to prison for what I have said. I will not be the first or the last. If I go to prison for telling the truth, it’s fine by me.”

Lukasik, a former champion wrestler, stood as an independent councillor in Enfield in 2014. During the campaign Lukasik told the Barnet and Whetstone Press that he wanted to help foreigners: “We, foreigners, English people, must find some solution to live together peacefully.”

This benevolent sentiment is absent from Lukasic’s current presence on social media where he has posted slogans warning about the number of Muslims in Europe, and called for trade unions to be banned.

Lukasik’s views on Islam have been uploaded to YouTube by Britain First’s deputy leader Jayda Fransen, and he has been photographed alongside her on several occasions.

In one piece of footage, he says: “I am here to warn you about Islamisation,” before claiming that Muslim gangs have been involved in the “ritual rape” of young white girls.

Contacted on Wednesday night, Lukasik said he stood by the sentiment of what he said in the footage but would not murder Merkel or anyone else. He said he had lived in Germany and became emotional when asked about Merkel but would not actually shoot her.

“I do not like what she has done because of the many Muslims who have come to Germany and the terrorist attacks in Europe. I would not shoot her or anyone,” he said.

He said he had helped Britain First to recruit supporters among the Polish community and took 40 supporters to recent rallies by the group.

“I worry about the Muslims coming to Europe. We have seen too many deaths from terrorism in Germany, in London, in Manchester,” he said.

Three far-right activists from Poland were recently stopped from attending the Britain First rally in Birmingham after being detained by the UK authorities at airports.

They included Jacek Międlar, 28, an antisemitic priest, and his fellow activist Piotr Rybak, who was indicted for inciting hatred last year after burning an effigy of an orthodox Jew during a protest against Muslim immigration.

Rafał Pankowski from the Never Again Association, which monitors far-right activity in Europe, said Lukasik was “the tip of the iceberg”, because of growing radicalisation in the UK Polish community by far-right groups. “It is time for British authorities and organisations to wake up to this issue,” he said.

To watch the full experience click here.

What is it like to flee your home and start again in a new country? Between April 2016 and March 2017, 36,846 people applied for asylum in the UK. As of March, a backlog in cases meant the total number of people still waiting for a decision stood at nearly 31,500.



While asylum seekers wait for their Home Office interview and the subsequent decision, they live on £5 a day and are unable to work or choose where they live. In Limbo you step into their shoes and experience their state of mind while you wait for the decision that will determine the rest of your life.



The piece was made after conducting interviews with asylum seekers from 12 countries as well as immigration lawyers and barristers. The voices in the soundtrack are those of real refugees who guide the viewer through the experience – from arriving in an unfamiliar city to acute worry for loved ones left behind, concern about not being allowed to work, and the Home Office interview on which so much rides . They spoke about the often slow and painful process of the application and the subsequent wait to be reunited with their families. The Home Office aims to make an initial decision within six months, but many wait longer than this. Despite access to services from refugee charities, for the most part they are unable to travel, work or learn English.

Guardian VR wanted to capture the sense of isolation that many interviewees spoke about, caught between two lives, that of the place they left and the new one they hope to build . The piece was made in collaboration with the creative practice ScanLAB Projects, which specialises in creating digital replicas of environments using innovative 3D scanning technology. The resulting monochrome sketch-like aesthetic has the quality of a dream or nightmare where worlds are transparent and fragmented.

If you want to watch the film as a VR experience you can put your phone into Google cardboard and watch it on YouTube in cardboard mode. It’s also available on the Guardian VR app from the Google Play Store. It will be also be available soon on Gear VR.

If you lose your "keys" or forget your password, you won’t be able to read your own communication.

Encrypted emails and documents are protected by both encryption "keys" and passwords. The bad guys would need to know both to read your stuff.

If you plan to write an email to a Guardian journalist about a sensitive matter, look into PGP encryption. Used properly, PGP should make a message or document unreadable to anyone except the person who sent it and the person for whom it was encrypted. You will use a "public key" that belongs to the person you are writing to, but is freely available on the internet. This key turns your message into an unreadable jumble. Your recipient – and no one else – has a corresponding "private key" which can unlock messages that were encrypted by their public key.

Get started

Don't use your regular email address. Create a new email account solely for corresponding with the Guardian. Do it on a computer that isn't being monitored, and make sure the signup information you provide doesn't tie the account back to you.

If you're using a browser-based service such as Gmail, Yahoo! Mail or GMX webmail, look into Mailvelope for encrypting messages in your browser. Two popular applications for encrypting text and documents, which you can then paste or attach to emails, are Gpg4win for Windows and GPGSuite for Mac.

Once you have installed one of these tools you can use it to create your own PGP keys. Keep your private key and password safe and don't store the two together.

After that

You should encrypt your messages and attachments using both your public key and that of the person you are writing to. All being well this means that only you and the journalist will be able to decrypt them. You can find Guardian journalists' keys at pgp.theguardian.com.

Information carried with an email message can reveal your IP address. If you don't want the location you'll send from to be traceable, connect to your email service over the Tor network.

Email your encrypted material to us, along with a copy of your public key so we can reply to you also under encryption. Don't encrypt the public key itself.

Remember to log out after sending the message. You may also wish to delete the history of the correspondence from your browser or email software. Keep your computer secure.

Independent investigator will look into why murdered Iranian refugee had been accused of anti-social behaviour

Concerns over Bristol city council’s handling of the case of a disabled refugee murdered after a seven-year hate campaign by neighbours are being examined by an independent investigator.

Avon and Somerset police have been severely criticised by a watchdog over failings in the case of Bijan Ebrahimi, who was beaten to death and his body set alight after neighbours wrongly believed he was a paedophile.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) concluded that the force may have been biased against Iranian-born Ebrahimi because of his race and missed a string of chances to step in to protect him from his persecutors.

But the report also highlights concerns with the way Ebrahimi was treated by other agencies, including Bristol city council.

Three years before his murder, the council took out an injunction against Ebrahimi, a council flat tenant, accusing him of antisocial behaviour. One of the key witnesses cited during the proceedings was PC Kevin Duffy, the local beat officer jailed over his failings in the case.

The council’s role in the case will be set out in a multi-agency learning review, which was commissioned by the Safer Bristol Partnership and is due to be published later this summer or in the autumn.

Bristol’s mayor, Marvin Rees, said on Wednesday that he had met the family and apologised on behalf of the council for any shortcomings on its part.

He said: “This was a horrific case which highlighted the need for many things to change. I would like to extend my deepest sympathies to Bijan Ebrahimi’s family. I know this has been a long-running case and I’m aware that they have been suffering since 2013. I have met them and feel their pain acutely.”

Separately, Duffy issued a statement in which he insisted that his conviction for misconduct in a public office was unfair and said the blame for Ebrahimi’s death lay solely with the man who murdered him, Lee James.

He said he was a scapegoat and let down by “organisational failings” and a lack of resources in Avon and Somerset police.

Duffy asked: “Why was it that only the lowest-ranking officers, three police constables and a community support officer, were singled out for prosecution in relation to police contact prior to Mr Ebrahimi’s murder?

“Why was it that the people on the front line, who have to make decisions in real time, under pressure and with competing demands on their time were prosecuted rather than their senior officers who should have been supervising and supporting them?”

In the days before his death, Ebrahimi called the police to say his neighbour, James, had barged into his home and attacked him. Police did attend but arrested Ebrahimi, 44, rather than James. Neighbours, who wrongly believed he was a paedophile, cheered as he was led away.

Ebrahimi was allowed home and later called police to say a mob had gathered outside, pleading with them for help. Hours later James murdered him.

The IPCC pinpointed failings in scores of contacts between Ebrahimi and the police, going back seven years.

It emerged that the city council was aware six years before his murder of the false accusations that Ebrahimi was subject to. In August 2007 the word “pervert” was daubed on the front door of his council home. The city council removed the graffiti.

But it also highlighted how in June 2010 the city council successfully applied for a housing act injunction against Ebrahimi following claims that he, rather than his neighbours, was being disorderly. The council had gathered witness statements including one from Duffy. Ebrahimi challenged the injunction and it was overturned in November 2010.

Join us in urging the world’s two biggest charitable funds to move their money out of fossil fuels

To Bill and Melinda Gates, founders of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Jeremy Farrar and Sir William Castell, director and chair of the Wellcome Trust:

Your organisations have made a huge contribution to human progress and equality by supporting scientific research and development projects. Yet your investments in fossil fuels are putting this progress at great risk, by undermining your long term ambitions.

Climate change poses a real threat to all of us, and it is morally and financially misguided to invest in companies dedicated to finding and burning more oil, gas and coal. Many philanthropic organisations are divesting their endowments from fossil fuels. We ask you to do the same: to commit now to divesting from the top 200 fossil fuel companies within five years and to immediately freeze any new investments in those companies.

The argument for a campaign to divest from the world’s most polluting companies is becoming an overwhelming one, on both moral and financial grounds. As Archbishop Desmond Tutu puts it: “People of conscience need to break their ties with corporations financing the injustice of climate change”.

Note from Alan Rusbridger, editor-in-chief

Divestment serves to delegitimise the business models of companies that are using investors’ money to search for yet more coal, oil and gas that can’t safely be burned. It is a small but crucial step in the economic transition away from a global economy run on fossil fuels.

The usual rule of newspaper campaigns is that you don’t start one unless you know you’re going to win it. This one will almost certainly be won in time: the physics is unarguable. But we are launching our campaign today in the firm belief that it will force the issue now into the boardrooms and inboxes of people who have billions of dollars at their disposal.

What they say

We’re not going to be able to burn it all”

Barack Obama

Frequently asked questions

What is fossil fuel divestment?

Divestment is the opposite of investment – it is the removal of your investment capital from stocks, bonds or funds. The global movement for fossil fuel divestment (sometimes also called disinvestment) is asking institutions to move their money out of oil, coal and gas companies for both moral and financial reasons. These institutions include universities, religious institutions, pension funds, local authorities and charitable foundations.

Evidence shows that proven fossil fuel reserves are more than three times higher than we can afford to burn in order to stay below the generally agreed threshold for dangerous climate change. Fossil fuel companies are currently banking on extracting these reserves and selling them – and are actively prospecting for more. By supporting these companies, investors not only continue to fund unsustainable business models that are bound to make climate change worse, but they also risk their financial assets becoming worthless if international agreements on climate change are met.

When Edward Snowden met journalists in his cramped room in Hong Kong's Mira hotel in June, his mission was ambitious. Amid the clutter of laundry, meal trays and his four laptops, he wanted to start a debate about mass surveillance. He succeeded beyond anything the journalists or Snowden himself ever imagined. His disclosures about the NSA resonated with Americans from day one. But they also exploded round the world. For some, like Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, it is a vitally important issue, one of the biggest of our time: nothing less than the defence of democracy in the digital age.

stop auto-play Zoe Lofgren US congresswoman

But the intelligence agencies dismiss such claims, arguing that their programs are constitutional, and subject to rigorous congressional and judicial oversight. Secrecy, they say, is essential to meet their overriding aim of protecting the public from terrorist attacks.

stop auto-play Stewart Baker Former NSA general counsel

The debate has raged across time zones: from the US and Latin America to Europe and to Asia. Barack Obama cancelled a trip to Moscow in protest at Russian president Vladimir Putin's protection of Snowden. Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff cancelled a state visit to Washington in protest at the US spying on her. Bolivian president Evo Morales's plane was forced down in Vienna amid suspicion that Snowden was being smuggled out of Russia. In Germany, a "livid" Angela Merkel accused the US of spying on her, igniting a furore that has seen the White House concede that new constraints on the NSA's activities may be necessary. Meanwhile, in Britain, prime minister David Cameron accused the Guardian of damaging national security by publishing the revelations, warning that if it did not "demonstrate some social responsibility it would be very difficult for government to stand back and not to act".

Caught in a net US internet companies, their co-operation with the NSA exposed by Snowden's documents, fear a worldwide consumer backlash, and claim they were forced into co-operation by the law.

Much of the NSA’s defence is that the public should be unconcerned, summed up by the dictum: “If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.” But civil liberties groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union warn that surveillance goes well beyond what Congress intended and what the US constitution allows.

stop auto-play Chris Soghoian Principal technologist, ACLU

Cell phones, laptops, Facebook, Skype, chat-rooms: all allow the NSA to build what it calls ‘a pattern of life’, a detailed profile of a target and anyone associated with them. And the number of people caught up in this dragnet can be huge.

Three degrees of separation You don't need to be talking to a terror suspect to have your communications data analysed by the NSA. The agency is allowed to travel "three hops" from its targets — who could be people who talk to people who talk to people who talk to you. Facebook, where the typical user has 190 friends, shows how three degrees of separation gets you to a network bigger than the population of Colorado. How many people are three "hops" from you?

Number of friends: Login to Facebook ? Connect to Facebook to get your friend count. Your information will not be saved. LOGOUT 1ST DEGREE: FRIENDS FRIENDS 2ND DEGREE: FRIENDS OF FRIENDS FRIENDS OF FRIENDS 3RD DEGREE: FRIENDS OF FRIENDS OF FRIENDS FRIENDS OF FRIENDS OF FRIENDS Calculations are based on an analysis of Facebook that reports a typical user has an average of 190 friends and 14% of those friends are friends with each other.

Faced with growing public and political concern over the quantities of data it is collecting, the NSA has sought to reassure people, arguing that it collected only a tiny proportion of the world’s internet traffic, roughly equivalent to a “dime on a basketball court”. But in reality, that is still a huge amount of data. The Library of Congress, one of the biggest libraries in the world, gathers 5 terabytes a month. The NSA sucks up much, much more.

Since you began reading this, the NSA has selected terabytes terabytes of data for review. That's about

two-hour HD movies.

The NSA say it needs all this data to help prevent another terrorist attack like 9/11. In order to find the needle in the haystack, they argue, they need access to the whole haystack.

stop auto-play Stewart Baker Former NSA general counsel

Snowden recognises the value of the NSA in counter-terrorism, but thinks the spy agency has dangerously over-reached itself. He is a fugitive from US law, in exile in Russia. But the debate he wanted to start when he decided to become a whistleblower is now happening.

We wanted to find out how people get to grips with the basics of online dating. Here’s what we found out.

The Soulmates TeamTuesday 18 Aug 2015

~_~

For many of us, online dating is still a new take on dating. Yes, it’s been around for over a decade, but for various reasons, thousands of us are joining sites for the very first time every month.

So what lessons are there to be learned from a dating world which has moved online?

1. The numbers game

These days, at least in the early stages, dating is a numbers game. You can’t just rely on one potential match. The very nature of dating websites means you can interact with several people at one time, so you should never assume someone is only talking to you. Exclusivity still exists, but you should never assume it. When you think it’s time to be exclusive, make sure to have a proper conversation about it.

2. The art of self-marketing

Online dating involves an element of self-branding. You need to understand who you are, and what you really look like. Your profile should describe you – not the person you want to be, but the person your date will meet in real life. Your photos should show what you really look like. Yes, they should be flattering and well chosen, but you need to understand the difference between a good photo of yourself, and one which doesn’t actually look like you. When in doubt, always use recent photos, and ask the opinion of a friend.

3. Everyone gets nervous

The more singletons I meet, the more obvious this truth really is. No matter their background, no matter how attractive or rich they are, no matter whether they are male or female, everyone gets nervous when it comes to dating, so bear that in mind. Be nice to fellow daters. Don’t criticise people’s profiles or belittle anyone. If you don’t agree with something someone says on their profile, don’t call them out on it – either accept and overlook it, or move on to someone else. I once had someone critique my profile, and I found it really hurtful. It takes a lot to put yourself online, so respect that in other daters too.

With that in mind, try to be mindful of other people’s feelings. Don’t lead people on just for the attention, and be honest about your intentions.

4. A lesson in self-awareness

The more dates I go on, the more I find I learn about myself.

I used to be a girl with a lengthy tick-list of criteria for my ideal man, but nowadays I’ve learned which attributes really matter. The thing I found, though, was that these characteristics only became clear once I experienced them, or found them lacking, in real life. Yes, we can all describe what height of partner we prefer, or a preference of hair colour … but are those the things that really count?

The other lesson I learned about myself was through dating men who did things which I realised I also did. By dating men similar to me in certain respects, I began to better understand the way other people might respond to some of my nuances. Most of my lessons about dating have been learned from the people I’ve met along the way – which is one of the reasons why I always advise daters to get out there and play the field.

5. You need time to date

While online dating may seem like a “quick win”, any type of dating is time-consuming, and rightly so. You’re hoping to find a future partner, someone to share your entire life with, and that’s an important decision to make, so you need to invest time in making that decision and finding the right person. I always advise against becoming too serious and treating dating as a second job, but you do still need to devote time to the process.

Find a way of incorporating online dating into your spare time – search the web with your favourite TV show on, or with the radio playing and a glass of wine in hand. Ask a friend to help you – I’ve spent many an evening searching dating sites with one of my best friends, and even letting her pick my dates for me.

Try to check your account every couple of days, because if you lose contact with someone for too long, they may well move on. Meet up as quickly as possible, so that you can work out if you have a connection in real life.

~_~

Anyone who’s spent any time in the online dating world has no doubt seen a stream of dodgy dating profile photos – you know, the ones that make you crack up, cringe and/or send to your friend before instantly deciding this person isn’t for you. So how do you avoid these pitfalls in your own photos? Here are some of the absolute photo no-nos.

Disco inferno

Seems obvious, but you’d be surprised how many people think it’s a good idea to use a photo of themselves half way through a night on the Jagerbombs. But let’s face it, you rarely look your best when your eyes are barely pointing the same way. You might think a photo of you robot dancing makes you look good fun but trust us, drunken pics are a big dating turn off.

The morning after

Equally, avoid pics taken the next day after a big night. You in a kitchen laden with empty bottles, dressed in a onesie, still wearing last night’s make up and clutching an empty tub of Haagen-Dazs might not send the right message to potential dates. Ok, we admit we’re exaggerating a bit on this one but you get the idea.

1990s nostalgia

If your appearance hasn’t changed much, then it’s likely you can get away with a shot taken a few years ago. But if you’re delving into the past by more than that, make sure there aren’t any clues in the shot that give away just how old it is. So perhaps avoid the pic of you with the ‘Rachel’ haircut and an All Saints CD on the table next to you. We think you’ll be rumbled in no time.

Striking a pose

Don’t get us wrong – there’s a place for studio photography. But for dating photos, these type of shots run the risk of making you look like David Brent. We’ve all seen those sultry glances and cheesy poses which look staged, a bit desperate and even a tad creepy, when you want your dating pics to look natural, carefree and spontaneous.

A bit of a mouthful

You might want to show off how cultured you are with a pic of you eating in a Michelin star restaurant. Especially if you’re a foodie looking for someone to share your love of experimental cuisine with. But we all remember that shot of Ed Miliband eating a bacon sarnie and shudder. Unless you’re Nigella Lawson, it’s impossible to look sexy whilst shoving any sort of food item into your mouth. So save your gastronomic expertise for that third date instead.

The gym bod

Guys – we know you might have spent six months in the gym perfecting those pectorals, or toning those abs, and you want your date to know you’re in great shape, right? Wrong. Shots of you topless in front of the mirror send all the wrong messages and are a surefire way to make people swipe left. So stay away from mirror selfies.

The globetrotter

Unless they were taken by a pro, travel photos can have more than a whiff of cheese about them. So that pic of you pretending to hold up the Leaning Tower of Pisa, or the one of you with a giant snake around your neck? These are best left for amusing your friends on Facebook, not for trying to attract the love of your life.

The try hard

It’s important to show your potential dates something about you. But be authentic. A photo of you clutching a book of Shakespeare’s Sonnets could look just a teeny bit pretentious or like you’re trying too hard. Make sure any props in your pics, like cameras, books or headphones really show what makes you tick, not just what you think makes you look appealing.

The celebrity stalker

The time you posed for a selfie with One Direction might be one of the best moments of your life, but a dating photo like this will distract attention away from you. Plus you don’t want your date struggling to work out which one you are and then feeling disappointed you’re not Niall. After all, this isn’t a game of Where’s Wally, so make sure you are the sole focus of your dating pics.

It’s behind you

It sounds obvious but you’d be surprised how easy it is to forget this one – always think about what’s behind you in the frame. So maybe avoid shots outside the dodgy takeaway, betting shop or massage parlour. And be extra aware of slogans which amuse for the wrong reasons, so while The Codfather might be a great name for a chippy, it’s not so cool in the background of your dating pics.

The ex files

Just in case there’s anyone out there who still thinks it’s ok to use a photo with your ex cropped out; oh heck no! Half an arm visible around your shoulder is always a dead giveaway, but there really is no way you can successfully pull this off, no matter how good your Photoshop skills. And you don’t want potential dates to be thinking about your ex, ever.

You know you might have the best dating profile out there, one that maybe your friends helped you write. It reads well and even sounds like you.

You’re really, really keen to meet someone, you know you are, your friends and family keep telling you that you are – yet something is lurking in the back of your mind…

It’s been a long time since you were out there on the dating scene. Or perhaps your last foray into the world of online dating didn’t go so well and you’re scared, doubtful and anxious as hell.

Do I? Don’t I? Sounds familiar? You’re struggling to press the ‘live’ button on your profile. You kind of want to be seen and yet you don’t.

I remember how it felt like. One minute I had all this stuff going on in my head about why it wouldn’t work and the next I’d imagine meeting the love of my life. I had preconceived ideas of the types of women pursued by men of my generation. I was believing all the stories I was reading and hearing from others and allowing them to cloud my judgment about whether it was really possible to meet someone online.

Being in the right headspace is now my number one tip for enjoying and being successful in online dating.

I came to realise that I had to have a clean mental slate going into it – I needed to deal with the ending of past relationships, grieve or wallow if necessary, and then pick myself up and move on.

I also needed to stop having those long mindless conversations with friends about the pitfalls and just try it and see for myself. I realised people love hearing and sharing horror stories!

I decided to have my own positive thoughts about online dating and that it was the perfect way for a woman in midlife to meet a guy and have some fun and who knows where it all might lead.

Keeping an open mind was vital because you know, if you think it’s going to be a disaster then you’re probably right! And yes, I was both excited and feeling out of my comfort zone but that’s ok!

So, what did I do to make sure I was in the right frame of mind for dating?

Surrounded myself with positive people

Got myself in shape physically so I felt good about myself

Dealt with issues from past relationships

Checked my attitude

Improved my self belief, confidence and self esteem

Decided to keep an open mind and heart

Once I’d got my head in the right space it didn’t really matter whether a date was a success or not, or the guy I liked the look of didn’t reply, because I was ok whatever happened. I knew I didn’t need a relationship to make me feel good about myself because I was already doing that on my own! And you know what? It’s a very attractive trait!

Our optional guided city tour will bring to life the giant domed Capitol building on 'the Hill' - home to the Senate and the House of Representatives - the vast Library of Congress and the Supreme Court. Stretching two miles from the Capitol to the Potomac River, the vast, manicured acres of the Mall boast the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, Vietnam Veterans' Memorial, the Smithsonian museums and - across the green swathe of the Ellipse, at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue - the White House itself.

~_~

Day

5

This is a day at leisure for anyone who just wants to take it easy by the one of the pools at the hotel or do some hippo-spotting from the lovely lawn overlooking the river. Alternatively, you could try elephant-back safaris, exciting helicopter flights or even river rafting (all subject to weather conditions), as well as sunset safaris or night safaris where you can experience the unique thrill of an open 4x4 vehicle game drive by spotlight. Exclusively for Riviera guests, there are also a limited number of places available to stay the night at a tented camp and go on a bushwalk. Our camp is a real ‘back to nature’ experience, with no electricity or en-suite facilities – we use portable ‘bush’ showers and toilets. Our chef will create excellent wholesome cuisine and you can listen out for any nocturnal visitors whilst sitting around the campfire! You rejoin the main tour on the morning of day 6.

Day

3

This morning we approach Victoria Falls for an outstanding guided walking tour. The area around the falls is surrounded by a unique, lush rainforest eco-system, watered by the fine spray rising from the falls. As we pass through several rainbows arching through the mist, the roar of the falls intensifies and conversation becomes virtually impossible. The anticipation mounts and on your first view, you will fully appreciate why this is truly one of the wonders of the natural world! During low water flow, an optional boat trip is available to Livingstone Island from where the famous explorer himself first saw the falls. For the ultimate view you can take a helicopter or even a ‘micro-light’ aircraft flight (essentially a powered hang-glider) on an optional ‘Flight of Angels’ tour. During the afternoon we drive west parallel to the Zambezi until it joins the Chobe River, actually forming the Botswana border, which we cross on small open speedboats. We stay three nights half board at the four-star Chobe Safari Lodge (some groups may stay at the four-star Mowana Lodge), beautifully located overlooking the river itself. All the air-conditioned rooms are well furnished in an African theme and river-facing. The lodge, with its high-ceilinged thatch-roofed public areas blends superbly with the natural surroundings. It also has a lovely swimming pool overlooking the river and an open-air bar and restaurant.

Day

After breakfast we drive through gentle rolling woodland and fields into Saxony, crossing the mighty River Elbe en route to somewhere that is synonymous with the heroic art of escape – Colditz, towering above the town atop a river cliff and seemingly impregnable! For a thousand years a series of fortifications crowned this ideal defensive position, but it is best known for its role as a prisoner of war camp during the Second World War. The massively walled castle was so secure it was selected to confine serial escapees, but Colditz “boasted” one of the war’s highest rates of successful ‘home runs’ as they were called, probably due to having so many ardent escapers who could pool their expertise to great effect. Our guided tour and the related exhibition offer a truly fascinating insight into the lives of both inmates and guards, and we see escape tunnels and a home-made radio, false uniforms, diaries, papers, fake documents and other escape equipment ingeniously created from whatever materials were to hand. Much was secreted about the buildings and, like the ‘radio room’, were discovered by maintenance workers after the war. Some of the most moving exhibits are postcards sent by prisoners to their children who they never saw for many years. For a complete contrast, next we visit nearby Meissen, famous of course for its exquisite porcelain, the first to be made outside China, in 1708. The rarity and cost of the factory’s products meant that it was the preserve of the rich and famous and Europe’s wealthy amassed vast collections – many of which grace the world’s great museums. We have a remarkable tour discovering how highly skilled artisans create these stunning works of art many of which take weeks, sometimes months to finish. Quite often referred to as Dresden porcelain, this is the only factory in Europe in which all the processes are completed by hand and we see the complete cycle from clay to finished article, after which there is a stunning museum displaying pieces from throughout the company’s existence. We soon arrive in Dresden for two nights, at the centrally located, four-star superior Hotel Steigenberger. Beautifully designed, this modern and very well managed property throughout makes extensive use of marble; the rooms are superbly decorated and have all the facilities you would expect of a hotel of this quality. Some dates will stay at the four-star superior Maritim Hotel, situated on the banks of the River Elbe and just a few minutes’ walk to the historic city centre. This modern conversion of a historic building offers fully air-conditioned spacious rooms. Both properties have a very good restaurant, a comfortable bar at both international standard hotels – your utmost comfort is assured.

Today we have a full day out visiting places for which Normandy is perhaps more famous. We first of all visit Bayeux, which as its name suggests is home to the world famous tapestry depicting the Norman invasion of Britain in 1066 which subsequently led to the Battle of Hastings and the firm establishment of William as, not only Duke of Normandy, but as King of England too. The embroidery is extremely delicate and indeed this is arguably the most perfect relic we have of the Middle Ages. After lunch we visit nearby Gold Beach, made so famous on 6th June 1944 – D-Day, the landing of the Allied Armies which led to the final liberation of Europe during the Second World War. We have the opportunity to visit perhaps the best museum in the area, at Arromanches, where the remnants of the Mulberry Harbour can be seen. We then return to our hotel. Whilst the excursions are included in your holiday, they are not compulsory so if you do not wish to take any of them, you can have more time to explore Rouen. Its attractions are numerous: it boasts the largest ceramic art museum in Europe, an excellent Fine Arts museum, including works by Monet, Renoir, Boudin and Delacroix, a superb shopping area, the fantastic cathedral, together with some of the most beautiful “olde worlde” streets you will find anywhere.

Seville is a city which defies words. It is simply one of the most beautiful cities in the world, with a history spanning the centuries and a wealth of monuments and buildings coupled with extensive peaceful parks, with the serene River Guadalquivir flowing through the centre. It has its origins in Roman times: the Emperor Hadrian, builder of the famous wall came from here. During the 8th Century that most fascinating of peoples, the Moors arrived, stayed for 500 years and left a unique legacy still in evidence today. However, if one event changed Seville, it was the discovery of the New World. Indeed Christopher Columbus is fittingly buried in the imposing cathedral. Immense wealth poured in from the Empire and catapulted Seville into one of the largest, and certainly richest cities in Europe. Much of Seville was built during this time and it seems to have changed little in the last five hundred years, with tiny winding streets, and cool hidden squares where the locals hide from the midday sun in high summer. Today though, it possesses a spirit which is very special. The city of Figaro, the setting for the classic opera Carmen, is here. It’s the home of Flamenco too, the origins of which are lost in the eons of time. In short this is real Spain at its unspoilt best. This morning, after breakfast we have a tour of this fascinating city, during which we will see the gothic cathedral, the world’s largest, the fantastic Alcazar – the fortified palace of the Moors with a richness of decoration which will astound you, the Tower of Gold, so named as it was used to store the plunder from the Americas, plus much more. During the afternoon you are free to explore Seville at your leisure, and if you wish, you could take a cruise on one of the many river boats.

Today we leave Tuscany after breakfast driving firstly to Assisi. This delightful medieval town, with its flower-hung streets, lovely views over the Umbrian countryside and fountain splashed piazzas is famous for a single event – the birth of Francis, the most revered saint in Italy. The man himself was one of the most extraordinary figures the Italian church has ever produced. He had a privileged upbringing, leading a very un-Christian lifestyle, but whilst imprisoned, God appeared to him. After release, he renounced his inheritance, living the life of a beggar, and mixed with lepers, but ultimately found his vocation founding the order of monks which bears his name, the Franciscans. Two years after his death, the basilica was built, financed by donations from all over Europe creating one of the most beautiful shrines in the Christian world adorned by arguably its greatest art collection outside an actual gallery. The building today is actually two churches, one on top of the other with St. Francis himself lying under the floor in the crypt. The mood inside is most respectful, being in tune with Franciscan principles - silence being the rule, quite plain around the tomb itself and accompanied by brown robed monks. We have ample time to visit the basilica together with the town, arriving in Rome early evening. Our hotel is the four-star Grand Hotel Beverly Hills which, located in the prestigious Parioli residential district, a short walk away from the Villa Borghese gardens and gallery. The hotel is around 15 minutes walk from the nearest metro stop, a direct tram is available just a few steps from the hotel to the Coliseum and there are various buses to connect with major attractions across the city. Bus stops are located a few steps from the hotel. The hotel has a spacious lobby with lots of space to relax on the comfortable leather sofas after a hard days sightseeing, American Bar with plenty of seating and large restaurant open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The hotel is decorated in a classic style and features extensive wood panelling in the public areas and is air conditioned throughout. All rooms are comfortably furnished with private facilities with bath or shower, mini bar, safe, hairdryer, air conditioning and flat screen satellite TV.

Today we visit Portugal’s second-largest city: Oporto is a colourful jumble of historic buildings, precipitously crowding the scenic riverfront. Spices, silks and other fine goods funded construction of this atmospheric city. This morning we enjoy a tour of the UNESCO-listed historic centre with a local expert, uncovering its major sights including the 13th-century cathedral and the stunning Baroque tower of the Clerigos Church. Experience the splendid Praça da Ribeira square with its distinctively tiled townhouses and unhindered views of the wine lodges across the river. Eating well is a long-standing tradition here, and there is time for an authentic lunch at one of the city’s many excellent restaurants. For atmosphere and fresh seafood, the eateries on the riverfront promenade are a reliable choice. One of the best ways to walk off a hearty meal is by browsing the many little shops dotted across the city, specialising in fine art, antiques, ceramics and all manner of goods. Try the local pastries – some of the most delicious you’ll ever taste. Oporto is synonymous with the port wine trade, so no visit here is complete without a visit to one of the city’s renowned wine lodges, so we now head to arguably the greatest one, first crossing the imposing Dom Luis Bridge which bears a startling resemblance to a famous French tower, having been completed by a disciple of Gustave Eiffel. At Taylor’s Port Lodge, we learn the fascinating history of port wine and its close British connections. Taking its name from the city through which it is shipped, this fortified wine is made with grapes from the vineyards of the Douro Valley and are still, staggeringly, trodden by foot. The wine is lovingly tended and matured, sometimes for decades, before you can enjoy its subtle flavours. Of course, you’ll get the chance at the end of the fascinating visit to sample this wonderful drink. Later we return to the hotel in time for a final dinner at the Douro Palace.

This morning you visit what for many will surely be the most memorable and fascinating monument in Sri Lanka: Sigiriya, or the Lion Rock, is a massive 183-metre granite tower with sheer cliffs on all sides, crowned by the remains of a 1,500-year-old royal palace. The entire site is encircled by a moat and ramparts enclosing a variety of water gardens, the remains of numerous buildings, and caves. As you approach Sigiriya rock, you see some of the finest ancient murals in the country – the ‘Cloud Maidens’ are found under a fold of rock, and show in exquisite detail a procession of jewelled, beautifully dressed women bearing offerings of lilies and lotus flowers. Facing us is the imposing final entrance to the palace above, the Lion Rock, a colossal head of a lion, built from brick and plaster in ancient times. Today, just the two front paws remain, their claws menacingly extended, still guarding the palace. It should be noted that there are numerous steps to the top of Sigiriya rock, but should pose no problem for those with normal mobility. Spend the rest of the afternoon at leisure to enjoy our hotel’s pool and facilities.

After breakfast, we bid goodbye to Jaipur and head north, deeper into the interior of rural Rajasthan. We pass numerous small villages and towns on our way to the Sekhawati region of the state and the village of Alsisar. This was once part of India’s Silk Road and over the years the merchants here grew very rich, building a large number of luxurious mansions known as ‘havelis’, to display their wealth through the magnificence of their frescoed walls. Although most of these have now been abandoned, the imposing and luxurious residence of the local kings has been lovingly restored into an amazing Heritage hotel, the Alsisar Mahal, where we stay for the night. A maze of winding corridors, cool courtyards and arched colonnades, all the charming rooms are different, but most are very spacious and some have four-poster double beds. Rooms are air-conditioned, with bath and shower, but no TV. In the afternoon we take a guided walk through the village to explore the best examples of the havelis that lie just outside the walls of the Alsisar.

During breakfast this morning we cruise into the cosmopolitan city of Frankfurt. Unlike any other German city, this metropolis located on the River Main is a high-powered finance and business hub, home to one of the world’s largest stock exchanges. The city also has an unexpectedly charming and traditional side with its half-timbered buildings huddled around the ancient medieval squares of the old town, its wealth of peaceful parks and scenic riverside paths. We enjoy a guided tour of this fascinating city with its contrast between old and new; the modern skyline and skyscrapers on one side, and the medieval old town featuring St Paul’s Church, Emperor’s Cathedral and the neo-Gothic Römer City Hall on the other. There has been a Christmas market in Frankfurt for over six hundred years making it one of the oldest and most popular in Europe. Clustered around the city’s historic market place and the ancient church of St Paul’s, you cannot fail to be enchanted by its traditional ambience. No visit would be complete without sampling a glass or two of the warming Glühwein. Usually prepared from red wine (though it is also made from white), it is heated with citrus fruit and a range of spices such as cloves and cinnamon sticks – and sometimes drunk “mit schuss” meaning a shot of rum or brandy has been added for extra punch! After lunch back on board, wrap up and stroll amongst the maze of alluring stalls selling handmade arts and crafts and tempting seasonal food and drink, whilst the aroma of freshly made gingerbread and baked apples fills the air, simply magical. There’s time to relax on board before the Captain’s Dinner, so why not unwind with an aperitif in the bar and chat about the day’s events with newly made friends.

At 46,000-tonnes and with a passenger complement of around 1100, spacious Magellan retains a sense of traditional cruising and small-ship intimacy, thanks to the beautiful layout and tasteful contemporary style of her public areas, and of course the presence of her friendly, welcoming crew and cruise staff. A major refit in 2010 has ensured her position as a thoroughly modern, bright and supremely comfortable floating home, and she is a hugely welcome addition to the fleet.
