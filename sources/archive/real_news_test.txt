Head of Iraq inquiry says he does not believe former PM was clear enough about his decisions in the run-up to war

Sir John Chilcot has said he does not believe Tony Blair was “straight with the nation” about his decisions in the run-up to the Iraq war.

The chairman of the public inquiry into the 2003 conflict said the former prime minister had however been “emotionally truthful” in his account of events leading up to the war, meaning he relied on both emotion and fact.

Breaking his long silence on the matter in an interview with the BBC’s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, Chilcot said: “Tony Blair is always and ever an advocate. He makes the most persuasive case he can. Not departing from the truth but persuasion is everything.”

Chilcot was later asked if Blair was as truthful with him and the public as he should have been during the seven-year inquiry.

He replied: “Can I slightly reword that to say I think any prime minister taking a country into war has got to be straight with the nation and carry it, so far as possible, with him or her. I don’t believe that was the case in the Iraq instance.”

A spokesman for Blair told the BBC that “all these issues” had been dealt with.

Chilcot’s report, published in July last year, found that the former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein posed “no imminent threat” at the time of the invasion of his country in 2003, and the war was fought on the basis of “flawed” intelligence. It found that the cabinet’s decision to invade was made in circumstances that were “far from satisfactory”.

While giving evidence to the inquiry, Blair denied he had taken the country to war on the basis of a lie over Hussein’s supposed weapons of mass destruction.

Asked in the BBC interview if he felt Blair had given the fullest version of events to the inquiry, Chilcot said: “I think he gave an – what was – I hesitate to say this, rather, but I think it was, from his perspective and standpoint, emotionally truthful and I think that came out also in his press conference after the launch statement.

“I think he was under – as you said just now – very great emotional pressure during those sessions … He was suffering. He was deeply engaged. Now in that state of mind and mood you fall back on your instinctive skills and reactions, I think.”

He agreed the questioning sessions with Blair had been “extraordinarily intense”.

Chilcot also revealed he was given just eight minutes to decide if he wanted to lead the Iraq inquiry. “I knew that I could do it in a way that would not be the same as other inquiries which had proved problematic, frankly, in their procedure,” he said.

Asked how his would be different, Chilcot replied: “I was really clear from the outset, even before the parliamentary statement by Gordon Brown on the Monday, that it shouldn’t be an accusatory inquiry, it should be an inquiry into the facts, the history, in effect.”

Chilcot defended the length of the inquiry, which took nine years to complete: “There was so much stuff. It was a history of, in effect, starting in 2001, of eight to nine years of diplomatic, military, political resource, every sort of aspect.”

David Cameron pressured him to speed up the inquiry, Chilcot said, “which I think would have been unforgivable, a terrible waste of a lot of time and effort and truth”.

Asked how Cameron communicated, he said: “Essentially messages via the cabinet secretary or senior Cabinet Office staff, and then eventually public correspondence. Which I had no difficulty in replying to politely. Firmness and politeness are different things.”

Maj Gen Tim Cross, who advised Blair on the invasion of Iraq, said it was significant that Chilcot suggested emotion swayed Blair’s decision to go to war.

Speaking to BBC Breakfast he said: “Sir John didn’t say that he [Blair] did not tell the truth, but obviously his emotions had a big impact on his decision-making process.”

Asked whether Blair’s emotions intervened with rational decision-making, he said: “I’m sure it did. When I met Tony Blair in Kosovo, when my brigade ran refugee camps, he literally wept in the tents with the refugees.”

He added: “Sir John reaffirmed in this interview that one of his criticisms was that this was not last resort, one of the just war criteria.



“When I briefed Tony Blair it was quite clear that he felt that this was a necessity, that there was a just cause, that we had to do something about this. My own sense is that he wasn’t that far short, if he was short.

“I have no problem with the fact that in the end we did away with Saddam Hussein. I watched the mass graves being dug up in Iraq, this was a nasty brutal dictator.”

Fentanyl and carfentanyl – which are many times stronger than morphine – found in bodies of 46 people who died this year

Dozens of drug deaths in the UK this year are being linked to the opiates fentanyl and carfentanyl, which are being added to heroin even though they are many times stronger.

The National Crime Agency says dealers are mixing the class A drugs with heroin, and the substances have been found in the bodies of 46 people who died this year, although the exact causes of their deaths remained uncertain.

Many toxicologists have only recently started looking for fentanyl and carfentanyl in postmortem examinations, and cases involving the substances have yet to reach coroners’ courts – meaning there has been little public discussion of the impact of the drugs.

Public Health England said heroin users should be “extra careful” when using the drug, urging them to test a small amount first and not to take it alone. In April, the body issued an alert to medical and emergency services to be vigilant following a spate of deaths in the north of England.

Fentanyl is a synthetic opiate, which can be prescribed as a painkiller in carefully measured doses. It is up to 100 times stronger than morphine. Its analogue carfentanyl is 10,000 times stronger and has been used as an elephant tranquilliser.

Fentanyl hit international headlines in June, when it was found that Prince died after overdosing on it. In the US, fentanyl is one of the drugs blamed for the rapid rise in overdose deaths and widespread opioid addiction.

Harry Sumnall, a professor of substance use at the Public Health Institute at Liverpool John Moores University, said it was unclear why fentanyl and carfentanyl were appearing on the black market in the UK. He suggested it could have been bought on the dark web, and that new suppliers may be trying to enter the market.

“Whether it’s so-called user dealers who are buying a local supply, or new actors trying to enter the market but at a much lower level than the established heroin gangs, we don’t really know,” said Sumnall.

Simon Hudson, a technical director at LGC, which tests biological samples from coroners for pathology labs, said carfentanyl or fentanyl had been found in 46 cases since March.



He said about three or four of the 15 cases he received every week were testing positive for the substances but that in most instances a coroner had not yet recorded an official cause of death.

Hudson said that 20 micrograms of carfentanyl could be enough to kill someone. “If you look at a grain of sugar, that is one or two milligrams, so 20 micrograms is a 50th of that. You wouldn’t even be able to see that if it was on the desk in front of you. It would be like a spec of dust.

Fentanyl: drug 50 times more potent than heroin ravages New Hampshire Read more

“So if somebody’s trying to cut heroin and make it uniform throughout the whole amount of heroin, that’s pretty much impossible,” he said. “Taking it is like playing Russian roulette. One portion of heroin won’t have anything in it, but another will have a couple of specs and it’ll be enough to kill you.”

The majority of drug overdoses thought to have involved fentanyl and carfentanyl are in the Yorkshire and the Humber region, but police forces across the north of England, Northern Ireland and Hampshire have issued warnings after finding evidence that heroin was being mixed with the drugs.



In April, Humberside police confirmed that two people in Hull had died after taking heroin mixed with fentanyl. DCI Paul Kirby said the force was also trying to establish how a number of other drug users had died in the city.



The same month, police said they were investigating whether two deaths in the Leeds area were connected to “unusually strong heroin or heroin derivates”. In May, police linked the death of a 43-year-old man in Wakefield to carfentanyl-laced heroin.

A few days later, South Yorkshire police said they were investigating seven deaths around Barnsley. They said they were looking into the possibility that the dead had taken heroin contaminated with carfentanyl and fentanyl.

Rosanna O’Connor, the director of drugs, alcohol and tobacco at Public Health England, said the organisation was working closely with coroners, the police, drug testing labs and local drug services to get more information on confirmed and suspected cases.

US president will say west must ‘defend our civilisation’ from terrorism, bureaucracy and erosion of traditions

Donald Trump will use a landmark speech in Warsaw on Thursday to warn that the future of the west is in doubt if nations do not show more resolve in facing challenges.

“The defence of the west ultimately rests not only on means but also on the will of its people to prevail,” Trump will say, according to excerpts released by the White House.

“The fundamental question of our time is whether the west has the will to survive.”

Trump will paint a picture of the west facing existential challenges to “defend our civilisation” from terrorism, bureaucracy and the erosion of traditions, according to the extracts.

He will point to Poland – which in the last century endured Nazi and Soviet occupation – as an example of resolve.

“The story of Poland is the story of a people who have never lost hope, who have never been broken, and who have never forgotten who they are,” he will say.

In a nod to the conservative values he shares with Poland’s controversial ruling Law and Justice party, Trump will also call on the west to defend its traditions.

“Americans, Poles, and the nations of Europe value individual freedom and sovereignty,” he will say.

“We must work together to counter forces, whether they come from inside or out, from the south or the east, that threaten over time to undermine these values and to erase the bonds of culture, faith and tradition that make us who we are.”

Trump will also issue a Reaganesque call to tackle bureaucracy, which he will frame as more than just an inconvenience or byproduct of a rules-based society.

“On both sides of the Atlantic, our citizens are confronted by yet another danger – one firmly within our control. This danger is invisible to some but familiar to the Poles. The steady creep of government bureaucracy that drains the vitality and wealth of the people.

“The west became great not because of paperwork and regulations but because people were allowed to chase their dreams and pursue their destinies,” he will say.

Before the speech, Trump and the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, held a press conference touching on a range of issues including Russia, Islamic State, North Korea and the US president’s recent spat with CNN over a tweet posted by Trump of a video of him wrestling a man with a CNN logo superimposed on his head.

Trump praised Poland as being one of the “few nations” that met its financial obligations to Nato. He said since he had pressured other member nations to meet their financial obligations the “money had been pouring in”.

Trump said the US was also working with Poland “in response to Russia’s actions and destabilising behaviour”.

And he said nations must unite to confront Isis and terror groups but also “the threat from North Korea”.

“We will confront it very strongly. President Duma and I call on our nations to publicly demonstrate to North Korea and demonstrate there are consequences to their very bad behaviour.”

On Syria, Trump said both nations recognised the war-torn country required “a political solution that does not advance Iran’s destructive agenda and does not allow terrorist organisations to return”.

Asked about North Korea’s recent missile tests and Trump’s planned response, the president replied: “I don’t know. We’ll see what happens. I don’t like to talk about what I have planned.

“I have some pretty severe things we’re thinking about. I don’t draw red lines. President Obama drew red lines. I’m the one who makes it look a little bit better than it was.

“I would have done a lot sooner and you wouldn’t have the same situation as you do in Syria. We’ll just take a look at what’s coming over the weeks and months. It’s a shame they’re behaving in this way. They’re behaving in a very dangerous manner.”

Asked to comment on the wrestling tweet, Trump said: “What CNN did was unfortunate for them. They have some pretty serious problems.

“They have been fake news for a long time. They’ve been covering me in a very dishonest way. NBC is equally as bad, despite the fact I made them a fortune with the Apprentice.

“CNN has really taken it too seriously and they have hurt themselves very badly. We want to see honest – beautiful, free – but honest press. We want to see fair press. We don’t want fake news. Not everybody is fake news. But we don’t want fake news.”

Trump closed the press conference with a rambling response to a call from a reporter to “finally answer yes or no” whether he thought Russia interfered in the 2016 US election.

He said: “I think it was Russia; I think it was other countries. I think it could well have been Russia and it could have been other countries. A lot of people interfere. It’s been happening a long time.”

Trump accused the former US president Barack Obama of ignoring warnings given before the election that Russia was interfering with it.

“He was told in early August, Russia was trying to get involved, meddling, pretty strongly. He did nothing about it. The reason is he thought Hillary was going to win,” Trump said. “I agree it was Russia but I think it was other people or other countries. No one really knows, no one really knows for sure.”

The press conference ended with the reporter being shouted over by the Polish mediator to end her questioning.

US president says he is determined to confront threat from Pyongyang, after his ambassador to UN raises prospect of military action if diplomacy fails

Donald Trump has said he is considering some “very severe things” in response to North Korea’s successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) this week, as he called on other nations to exert pressure on Pyongyang over its “very bad behaviour”.

The president’s comments, made in Poland, came after the US ambassador to the UN made a push for new sanctions at a security council meeting and said America’s “considerable military forces” could be used against North Korea.



Nikki Haley told the meeting the US would submit a draft resolution within days “that raises the international response in a way that is proportionate to North Korea’s escalation”, but warned Washington had options if diplomacy failed.

“The United States is prepared to use the full range of our capabilities to defend ourselves and our allies,” Haley said. “One of our capabilities lies with our considerable military forces. We will use them, if we must, but we prefer not to have to go in that direction.”

She said the US was eyeing penalties against “any country that does business with this outlaw regime”.



Trump said the US would confront the North Korean threat, but noted that he would not draw a red line. “I don’t like to talk about what I have planned, but I have some pretty severe things that we’re thinking about,” he said. “That doesn’t mean we’re going to do them.”

Some administration officials are still hoping to persuade China to increase economic pressure on Pyongyang.

Trump is scheduled to meet the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg, where he will travel from Poland later on Thursday.



Trump and Vladimir Putin are also expected to address growing North Korean provocations at their meeting on Friday.

Haley did not go into detail about the proposed resolution but said that if the council was united, the international community could cut off major sources of hard currency to North Korea, restrict oil to its military and weapons programs, increase air and maritime restrictions, and hold senior officials accountable.



China has already called for restraint from all sides, after joining diplomatic forces with Russia to suggest that North Korea suspend its missile programme in return for a moratorium on large-scale US and South Korean military exercises.

Donald Trump's romance with China's Xi has cooled, 'ass-kicking' could lie ahead Read more

China is pushing for talks between world powers and North Korea on dismantling its nuclear programme but the US maintains that Pyongyang must first halt its missile and nuclear tests.



China’s UN ambassador, Liu Jieyi, said North Korea’s missile test was a “flagrant violation” of UN resolutions, but aimed his missive at both sides of the conflict.



“We call on all the parties concerned to exercise restraint, avoid provocative actions, and belligerent rhetoric, demonstrate the will for unconditional dialogue and work actively together to defuse the tension,” Jieyi said.



That would cover deployments like the live-fire ballistic missile exercise early on Wednesday that officials in Seoul said was intended as a warning to Pyongyang.

The Pentagon said on Wednesday that the missile test-fired by North Korea was not one the US had previously seen, and was fired from a new launch point.



Jeff Davis, the Pentagon spokesman, told reporters that as no airspace had been cleared for the test, commercial planes and ships in the surrounding area had been exposed to risk. He said: “This act demonstrates that North Korea poses a threat to the United States and our allies and we remain prepared to defend ourselves and our allies and to use the full range of capabilities at our disposal.”



Kim delivered his own message on Wednesday, with the state Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) quoting him as saying: “American bastards would be not very happy with this gift sent on the July 4 anniversary.”



The news agency claimed the North Korean missile was capable of carrying a “large, heavy nuclear warhead” that could survive re-entry into the earth’s atmosphere.

Kim was quoted as saying the North’s long confrontation with Washington had entered the “final stage” and that Pyongyang would not put its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles up for negotiation “unless the US hostile policy and nuclear threats come to an end completely”.

A report in its state media said Kim urged his scientists to “frequently send big and small ‘gift packages’ to the Yankees”.

Questions remain about whether the North can miniaturize a nuclear weapon to fit a missile nosecone, or if it has mastered the technology needed for it to survive re-entry into the earth’s atmosphere.



Some experts believe the North already has the ability to mount warheads on shorter-range missiles that can strike South Korea and Japan, home to dozens of US military bases and about 80,000 US troops.

Investigators seeking to speak to attacker’s brother Hashem in Libya but do not believe large network was behind bombing

Police investigating the bombing of Manchester Arena do not believe that attacker Salman Abedi acted alone, they said on Thursday.

Investigators do not believe that Abedi, who died in the suicide attack in May, which killed 22 other people, was part of a large network. But in a briefing DCS Russ Jackson, head of north-west counter-terrorism policing, said that others were involved and there could still be further arrests.

He said: “We don’t have evidence of a large network. We do however suspect others were either aware or complicit in the knowledge of this attack.”



Jackson said the police still wanted to talk to Abedi’s brother Hashem, currently being held in Libya.

“We are currently engaging with the Crown Prosecution Service and the Libyan authorities,” he said. “This is a live criminal investigation where central to it are 22 murdered people, with grieving families.”

Counter-terrorism police initially feared that Abedi was helped by a network of accomplices but concluded that he acted largely alone as he assembled the nail bomb.

Abedi was born in Manchester to Libyan parents, who moved back to Tripoli in recent years, along with his younger siblings. He is believed to have visited Libya shortly before the attack, arriving back in the UK on 18 May.

Nobel laureate and democracy campaigner was released from jail last month on medical parole after liver cancer diagnosis

The condition of China’s most famous political prisoner, the democracy campaigner and Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, has worsened, family friends and local reports have said.



Liu, 61, was jailed in 2009 for allegedly trying to topple China’s one-party state. He was given medical parole last month after being diagnosed with terminal liver cancer.

The dissident writer has been receiving treatment at a hospital in the north-eastern city of Shenyang where, according to one report, he has been separated from other patients and is guarded by plainclothes agents from China’s paramilitary armed police.

Writing on Twitter on Thursday, Ye Du, a dissident poet and family friend, said Liu’s condition had worsened and that relatives had been told he did not have much more time to live.

Citing medical staff and another family friend, the Hong Kong broadcaster RTHK reported that doctors had stopped giving Liu medication because he was too weak for treatment. He was also no longer able to eat. Yang Jianli, the friend, told RTHK Liu had developed a kidney problem as a result of the accumulation of fluid in his abdomen.

A photograph that circulated among friends and activists on Thursday showed a visibly emaciated Liu standing beside his wife, the writer Liu Xia.



Liu’s worsening health has distressed his friends and many admirers. “As someone who had a chance to talk to him in the past, I really feel heartbroken to see how he has been treated,” said Patrick Poon, a Hong Kong-based Amnesty International activist.

For the Chinese government it represents a public relations disaster, coming on the eve of the G20 summit in Hamburg. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, had hoped to use the two-day summit to bolster China’s case to be seen as a responsible and forward-looking world power. The state now faces international embarrassment and censure over its treatment of the 2010 Nobel peace prize winner.

The Global Times – a state-run tabloid that uses the Communist party description of Liu as a “convicted criminal”, rather than a political prisoner – emphasised the efforts that were now being put into his treatment. “A team of medical experts from all over China headed by a renowned surgeon from Beijing has arrived in Shenyang to help treat Liu Xiaobo,” the newspaper reported on Thursday.

However, campaigners and critics dismiss such reports as a smokescreen intended to cover-up Beijing’s persecution of Liu and his family.



Poon said Beijing was attempting to shift the focus on to how much medical attention Liu was receiving to shirk responsibility for its “cold-blooded” treatment of the democracy activist.

Beijing had repeatedly rejected calls for Liu to be treated abroad, Poon pointed out. “They simply ignored Liu’s modest request: to live out his last days in dignity,” he said. “Now, we might lose him any time soon.”

Reckitt Benckiser says ‘Petya’ ransomware – which also affected FedEx and others – disrupted production and deliveries

The “Petya” ransomware cyber-attack on some of the world’s biggest companies last week could cost Reckitt Benckiser, the maker of Nurofen painkillers and Durex condoms, an estimated £100m in revenue.

Reckitt Benckiser said the attack on 27 June had disrupted production and deliveries of goods to customers in several countries.



“Consequently, we were unable to ship and invoice some orders to customers prior to the close of the quarter,” the British consumer goods company said in a statement on Thursday. “Some of our factories are currently still not operating normally but plans are in place to return to full operation.”

Business Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news Read more

Reckitt Benckiser said it was still assessing the full financial impact of the attack on the company.

“We expect that some of the revenue lost from the second quarter will be recovered in the third quarter. However, the continued production difficulties in some factories mean that we also expect to lose some further revenue permanently.”

The Slough-based company now expects like-for-like net revenue in 2017 to increase by about 2%, down from an earlier growth forecast of 3%. With the company making almost £10bn in revenues in 2016, that would equate to about £100m in lost revenue.

Reckitt’s shares were among the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 in early trading on Thursday, down 2%.

The company has operations in more than 60 countries and sells its products in most countries, employing about 37,000 people worldwide. The sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote has benefited companies like Reckitt Benckiser, because it has significant operations outside the UK.

Companies including the UK-based advertising group WPP, Danish shipping company AP Moller-Maersk, and US delivery service FedEx, were hit by last week’s cyber-attack.

Maersk, the world’s largest shipping company, said it had been forced to redirect ships to alternative locations because the attack on its computer systems left it unable to dock and unload containers at some of its ports.

Ukraine government, banks and electricity grid hit hardest, but companies in France, Denmark and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania also attacked

Victims of a major ransomware cyberattack that has spread through the US and Europe can no longer unlock their computers even if they pay the ransom.

The “Petya” ransomware has caused serious disruption at large firms including the advertising giant WPP, French construction materials company Saint-Gobain and Russian steel and oil firms Evraz and Rosneft.

Infected computers display a message demanding a Bitcoin ransom worth $300. Those who pay are asked to send confirmation of payment to an email address. However, that email address has been shut down by the email provider.

“We do not tolerate any misuse of our platform,” said the German email provider Posteo in a blog post.

This means that there is no longer any way for people who decide to pay the ransom to contact the attacker for a decryption key to unlock their computer.

“This is not an experienced ransomware operator,” said Ryan Kalember, senior vice-president of cybersecurity strategy at Proofpoint.

The attack was first reported in Ukraine, where the government, banks, state power utility and Kiev’s airport and metro system were all affected. The radiation monitoring system at Chernobyl was taken offline, forcing employees to use hand-held counters to measure levels at the former nuclear plant’s exclusion zone.

The food giant Mondelez, legal firm DLA Piper, Danish shipping and transport giant AP Moller-Maersk and Heritage Valley Health System, which runs hospitals and care facilities in Pittsburgh, also said their systems had been hit by the malware.

WPP said in a statement that the computer systems at several of its subsidiary companies had been affected, adding that it was “assessing the situation and taking appropriate measures”.



In an internal memo to staff, one WPP firm said it was the target of “a massive global malware attack, affecting all Windows servers, PCs and laptops”. It warned employes to turn off and disconnect all machines using Windows.

Some technology experts said the attack appeared consistent with an “updated variant” of a virus known as Petya or Petrwrap, a ransomware that locks computer files and forces users to pay a designated sum to regain access.

But analysts at cyber security firm Kaspersky Labs said they had traced the infections to “a new ransomware that has not been seen before”. The “NotPetya” attack had hit 2,000 users in Russia, Ukraine, Poland, France, Italy, the UK, Germany and the US, Kaspersky said.

Last month’s WannaCry or WannaCrypt ransomware attack affected more than 230,000 computers in over 150 countries, with the UK’s national health service, Spanish phone giant Telefónica and German state railways among those hardest hit.



Symantec cyber security experts said they had confirmed the ransomware in the current attack was using the same exploit – a program that takes advantage of a software vulnerability - as WannaCry.

The exploit - called EternalBlue - was leaked by the Shadow Brokers hacker group in April and is thought to have been developed by the US National Security Agency.

To spread within companies that installed the patch to protect themselves against WannaCry, the Petya ransomware appears to have two other ways of spreading rapidly within an organisation, by targeting the network’s administrator tools.

It’s not yet clear how computers became infected with the ransomware in the first place, but it doesn’t seem to be through email as happened with WannaCry, said Kalember.

Pictures circulating on social media on Tuesday of screens purportedly affected by the attack showed a message stating, “Your files are no longer accessible because they have been encrypted,” and demanding a $300 ransom in the Bitcoin digital currency.

The attack affected all business units at Maersk, including container shipping, port and tug boat operations, oil and gas production, drilling services, and oil tankers, the company said, as well as seventeen container terminals.



“We can confirm that Maersk IT systems are down across multiple sites and business units due to a cyber-attack,” the Copenhagen-based firm said on Twitter. “We continue to assess the situation.”

The disruptions in Ukraine follow a rash of hacking attempts on state websites in late 2016 and a succession of attacks on the national electricity grid that prompted security chiefs to call for improved cyber defences.

The country’s prime minister, Volodymyr Groysman, said the attack was “unprecedented” but vital systems had not been affected. “Our IT experts are doing their job and protecting critical infrastructure,” he said. “The attack will be repelled and the perpetrators will be tracked down.”

In a bid to calm public fears about the attack, which temporarily shut down the country’s main airport and prevented travellers from using the Kiev metro, the authorities tweeted a GIF of a dog nonchalantly drinking tea in a room on fire.

Ukraine / Україна (@Ukraine) Some of our gov agencies, private firms were hit by a virus. No need to panic, we’re putting utmost efforts to tackle the issue 👌 pic.twitter.com/RsDnwZD5Oj

Deputy prime minister Pavlo Rozenko earlier tweeted a picture of a darkened computer screen and said the government’s IT system had been shut down. The state grid, Ukrenergo, said its system had been hit but power supplies were unaffected.

The central bank said an “unknown virus” was to blame for the latest attacks. “As a result of these cyber-attacks, these banks are having difficulties with client services and carrying out banking operations,” it said in a statement.



Ukraine has blamed Russia for previous cyber-ttacks, including one on its power grid at the end of 2015 that left part of western Ukraine temporarily without electricity. Russia has denied carrying out cyber-attacks on Ukraine.



Nicolas Duvinage, head of the French military’s digital crime unit, told Agence France-Presse the attack was “a bit like a flu epidemic in winter”, adding: “We will get many of these viral attack waves in coming months.”

The growing fight against cyber-attacks has seen protection spending surge around the world, with the global cyber security market estimated to be worth some £94bn ($120bn) this year – more than 30 times its size just over a decade ago.

Joseph Rowntree Foundation says inflation and benefit cuts are pushing decent standard of living further out of reach

Rising inflation and less generous state benefits have made it harder over the past year for families on tight budgets to enjoy what the public considers a decent standard of living, according to one of Britain’s leading thinktanks.

The Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) said that despite an above-inflation increase in the “national living wage”, low-income families were falling further behind a minimum income standard.

The thinktank said less generous in-work benefits had made life tougher for all low-income families with children, and that lone-parent single-breadwinner families were the hardest hit.

Each year, the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University provides a minimum income standard for the JRF, which acts as a barometer of living standards for households on low incomes.

While not a measure of poverty, the minimum income standard is based on feedback from the public on what it thinks people need to achieve a decent living standard. It includes money for school trips, Christmas presents and swimming lessons, and is updated annually to take account of economic trends and policy changes.

Consumer confidence is lowest since Brexit vote aftermath, survey finds Read more

The research found that despite the national living wage rising from £7.20 to £7.50, the gains had been offset by the rise in the cost of living, the freeze on tax credits and benefits, and wage increases being clawed back through reduced in-work benefits.

The JRF said a single person now needed to earn £17,900 a year to reach the minimum income standard. A dual-earner couple with two children needed to earn £20,400 each, while a lone parent with a preschool child had to earn £25,900. Developments over the past 12 months had made achieving these targets more difficult.

According to the report, a single-breadwinner family was £120 a week short of achieving the minimum income standard this year, up from £103 a week in 2016. An £11.24 pay rise from the national living wage had been offset by a £9.03 reduction in tax credits and housing benefit, and a £1.25 increase in tax and national insurance payments. The resulting 96p a week increase in pay had been dwarfed by a £17.75 rise in living costs, widening the gap between income and outgoings by £16.79 a week.

A lone parent was £55 a week short of the minimum income standard in 2016, but the shortfall widened to £67 a week in 2017. An £11.24 pay rise from the national living wage had been offset by a £3.51 reduction in tax credits and housing benefit, and a £1.44 increase in tax and national insurance payments. Net pay rose by £6.29 a week, but living costs added £18.55 to weekly expenditure, widening the gap with the minimum income standard by £12.26 a week.

The JRF said the gap for a working couple on low incomes had widened from £50 to £59 a week over the past 12 months.

Public sector pay cap is matter for future budgets, says Grayling Read more

Campbell Robb, chief executive of the JRF, said: “Struggling families tell us, as well as juggling the bills, it’s things like after-school clubs and swimming lessons that have to be sacrificed to cover the essentials.

“With the Bank of England forecasting inflation will increase even higher this year, families are facing no respite. We need the government to take action and ensure living standards do not fall backwards. Lifting the freeze on working-age benefits and tax credits must be the start, along with allowing people to keep more of their earnings.”

Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: “The government needs a proper plan to get wages rising. Ministers must stop holding down the pay of public sector workers, and give them their first proper pay rise in seven years. The minimum wage needs to rise faster, to reach £10 an hour as soon as possible.”

Rising cost of package holidays one factor in unexpected May increase, with inflation continuing to outpace UK wage growth

UK inflation rose to a four-year high in May as the pound’s sharp fall since the Brexit vote worked its way through the economy, intensifying the squeeze on household budgets.

The increasing cost of computer games and package holidays helped push up inflation to 2.9% last month, above the expectation of economists that it would remain at the 2.7% rate seen in April. The year-on-year rise in the consumer prices index (CPI) means prices continue to go up faster than wages for many workers, further denting living standards.

Inflation has been steadily increasing since the EU referendum result a year ago, which triggered a sharp drop in the value of the pound and pushed up the cost of goods imported from abroad. Inflation was 0.3% in May 2016, a month before the Brexit vote.

Higher oil prices have also added to the upward pressure on inflation. But in the latest official figures, there was evidence that sterling was a key factor. Statisticians highlighted the rising prices of package holidays, reflecting the growing cost of travelling abroad for Britons because of the weaker pound.

The Office for National Statistics said higher food and electricity prices also contributed to the inflation figure. This continues a pattern of essentials becoming increasingly expensive, leaving households with less to spend on treats. Consumer spending has slowed as a result, holding back the pace of overall economic growth.

The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said the inflation figures underlined the pressure on the new government to help households cope with rising living costs.



“The election showed that working people are struggling. And the biggest price rises in four years won’t provide any comfort,” she said.

“Working people are still £20 a week worse off, on average, than they were before the crash, and now rising prices are hammering their pay packets again. The new government must stop the real wage slide. Ministers must focus on delivering better-paid jobs all around the UK.”

Tim Roache, the general secretary of the GMB union, said: “Too often there is more month than money left after pay day. Ending the public sector pay freeze and making sure all workers are paid a decent wage is an absolute must and it needs to be on the agenda for the Queen’s speech.”

A Treasury spokesman said: “The government is helping families with the everyday cost of living by keeping taxes low, freezing fuel duty and increasing the ‘national living wage’.”

Inflation remains higher than the average wage growth of 2.1% year on year in the three months to March. Wage figures due on Wednesday were expected to show the gap between underlying pay growth and the inflation increase widened further in April.

The higher-than-expected inflation figure will intensify the debate over how long the Bank of England may leave interest rates at the record low of 0.25%. Inflation is well above the Bank’s 2% target, but policymakers have said they are happy to tolerate some overshoot because they want to support growth and employment as the UK prepares to begin Brexit negotiations.

The Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) will meet this week to set interest rates and announce its decision at noon on Thursday.

Oliver Kolodseike, a senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research consultancy, said: “Under normal circumstances, the Bank of England would have a sufficient set of arguments to justify an interest rate rise.

“That said, the recent rise in inflation was partly driven by external factors such as the oil price and the depreciation of the pound ... Another argument for the Bank to keep monetary policy on hold is that a rise in interest rates would increase the cost of borrowing, at a time at which consumers are already feeling a squeeze on their incomes as wage growth remains stubbornly low.

“Add to this uncertainty regarding the UK’s future outside the European Union and it seems sensible for the Bank to keep interest rates at their current levels.”



The ONS figures showed that its preferred measure of inflation, CPIH, which includes owner occupiers’ housing costs, hit a five-year high of 2.7% in May, up from 2.6% in April.

Its measure of how much manufacturers are having to pay for raw materials and energy showed that these cost pressures continued to ease off last month. Input prices increased by 11.6% in the year to May, down from a 15.6% rise in the year to April. This took pressure off companies to raise the prices they charge customers, and factory gate inflation held at 3.6% in May for the third month in a row

Jonathan Athow, the ONS deputy national statistician, said: “The rate of increase in factory gate prices has levelled now that manufacturing input costs have started to fall back.”

Paul Hollingsworth, a UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said this pattern supported a view that the struggling pound had fed through faster than expected, rather than by a larger amount.

“The effects of the lower pound already appear to be fading at the start of the production pipeline,” he said.

“Of course, it takes time for rises in producer prices to feed through to prices in the shops, and as a result, we think that CPI inflation will rise a bit further in the second half of the year, peaking at about 3.2% in the fourth quarter. But inflation is likely to drop back quickly in 2018 as the impact of the lower pound begins to fade.”

The pensions minister is facing criticism after suggesting that millions of women in their 60s who are facing cuts to their state pension could take up apprenticeships as a route to re-employment.

Guy Opperman said the government would not change laws that have disadvantaged older women, but instead highlighted “extended apprenticeship opportunities” to get older people into work.



His comments, which were met with cries of “shame”, came at a meeting in Westminster Hall at which fellow Conservatives and members of the Democratic Unionist Party were among dozens of MPs saying that the changes were unfair.



The debate centred on the plight of the so-called Waspi women – Women Against State Pension Inequality – whose aim is to achieve fair transitional arrangements for women born in the 1950s, for whom the state pension age is being raised from 60 to 66 by 2020.



Opperman said the government would not offer concessions and instead suggested that older people could retrain, go back to work or take up an apprenticeship.



“There is a massive amount that this government has done on a progressive basis to get people back into employment in their pre-pension years.

“We have created and extended a network of older people’s champions into all 34 Jobcentre Plus districts in the country.

“We have committed to lifelong learning – over 200,000 over 60 have entered further education.

“Thirdly, we have also extended apprenticeship opportunities as one of the best routes to skilled employment for people of all ages and gender. Such apprenticeships in England for example in 2014/15 are 12% of the starting apprenticeships are for those over 45,” he said.

Graham Jones, the Labour MP for Hyndburn, raised a point of order following Opperman’s comment.

“I’m struggling to hear the debate, did the minister just say that women aged 64 could go on an apprenticeship course?” he said.

Campaigners for Waspi women took to Twitter to express their anger at Opperman’s comments. Diana Mitchell Launt wrote: “I don’t want an apprenticeship: I’ve studied enough. ILM Level 3 in Management, NHS M & H trainer. H & S. Want my pension. 45 yrs NI.

“I care for my partner who has severe heart failure. At 60 I would be gutted that I would be stealing an apprentice ship from young.”



Another, Carol Billett, tweeted: “So maybe us Waspi Campaign women can all be become sorcerers apprentices and magic a pension! Guy Opperman, you’re a disgrace!”



Mhairi Black, the SNP’s pensions spokesperson, told MPs that if the Conservatives could find £1bn to strike a deal with the DUP, they could afford to give women the pensions they are due.



“For the government to say they can’t afford to pay these women what they are owed is laughable.

“These women have had the misfortune of being female and being born in the 1950s and live under this UK government, which refuses to do the right thing.

“This is an issue of equality. The UK government must take responsibility and do the right thing for these women who are missing out on their pension,” she said.

Labour’s Caroline Harris said the government “has betrayed these women – they’ve stolen their security and they’ve shattered their dreams without time to prepare and make the necessary alternative arrangements”.



Conservative MP Keith Simpson said his own wife was affected by the changes. “She feels incandescent with rage. She had no correspondence whatsoever,” he said. Another Conservative, former children’s minister Tim Loughton, described the changes as an “injustice” and “unfair burden” made worse by “poor communications” from the government.

Sammy Wilson, a DUP MP, said his party would use its “influence, however minimal or maximum”, to push the government into changing the policy.

Fans pay tribute to popular children’s television performer who created green witch character with Rod Hull in the 1980s

The children’s television actor Carol Lee Scott, best known as Grotbags the witch, has died aged 74.

The entertainer appeared in several children’s programmes in the 1980s and early 1990s, including the Rod Hull hit Emu’s World.

Scott’s death was announced by relatives on social media, prompting an outpouring of nostalgic tributes by fans.

Among those remembering the performer was comedian Rufus Hound, who said she was “an icon for folk of my generation”.

Many warmly remembered Scott’s Grotbags character, with one fan tweeting: “Rest in peace grotbags, another part of my childhood heaven bound.”

The Somerset-born actor’s early career saw stints as a cabaret performer touring clubs in the north of England. She worked as a London pub singer and as a Blue Coat at holiday camp Pontins.

She spent 19 years working for the holiday park company before collaborating with Hull in the 1980s.

The pair created Grotbags while performing a summer season in Cleethorpes, with the character first appearing in Emu’s World in the 1980s before going it alone.

Also starring puppeteer Richard Coombs, Grotbags ran on ITV for three series between 1991 and 1993, with each episode following the antics of the green witch and her minions at her Gloomy Fortress. Scott and Hull remained friends until his death in 1999.

Scott’s niece Gina Mear wrote on Facebook on Wednesday: “My dear aunty Carol lost her brave fight against cancer yesterday. To many of you she was Grotbags – a legend! To me she was just aunty Carol. I shall miss her hugely, rest in peace Carol.”

A damning report has criticised police for failing to act on online fraud – the majority part of the most common crime in England and Wales – because the amounts being stolen are too modest.

As Scams Awareness Month gets under way this July, an investigation by the National Audit Office (NAO), which scrutinises public spending for Parliament, has highlighted a laclustre response by the Home Office, which is also failing to get banks and other important stakeholders to take action.

“For too long, as a low value but high volume crime, online fraud has been overlooked by government, law enforcement and industry,” says Sir Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, which describes current action as “disproportionate to the threat”.

“It is now the most commonly experienced crime in England and Wales and demands an urgent response. While the Department is not solely responsible for reducing and preventing online fraud, it is the only body that can oversee the system and lead change."

The City of London Police is the national lead force for online fraud and runs Action Fraud, the national centre for reporting fraud.

But Police and Crime Commissioners and chief constables are responsible for policing in their local areas and although the face of crime is changing, forces take different approaches to tackling online fraud. For some it is not a priority, the NAO warns.

“The launch of the Joint Fraud Taskforce in February 2016 was a positive step, but there is still much work to be done. At this stage it is hard to judge that the response to online fraud is proportionate, efficient or effective”

Through the Taskforce, the Home Office is seeking to raise awareness of online fraud, reduce card not present fraud and to return money to fraud victims. But it faces challenges convincing other partners such as banks and law enforcement bodies to take on responsibility for preventing and reducing fraud, the report has found.

And without accurate data, the NAO warns that the Department has no clear idea whether its response is sufficient or adequate.

“Not only is online fraud under-reported, but where data is available, there is a lack of sharing of information between government, industry and law enforcement agencies,” adds Morse. “There is, for example, no formal requirement for banks to report fraud or share reports with government.

"Measuring the impact of campaigns and the contribution government makes to improving online behaviours is challenging. The growing scale of online fraud suggests that many people are still not aware of the risks and that there is much to do to change behaviour.

“In addition, different organisations running campaigns, with slightly different messages, can confuse consumers and reduce their effectiveness."

Nor can government and industry simply pass on responsibility for online fraud prevention to consumers and businesses, the report asserts. The NAO found the protection banks provide varies, with some investing more than others in educating customers and improving their anti-fraud technology. The ways banks work together in responding to scams also needs to improve.

Though examples of how to go about preventing people from becoming victims of these crimes are out there, such as Sussex Police’s initiative to help bodies such as banks and charities identify potential victims, the nature of online fraud makes it difficult to pursue and prosecute criminals.

There are also concerns about the sentences fraudsters receive.

Responding to the report, a Home Office spokesperson said: "Tackling online fraud demands a collaborative and innovative response to keep pace with the emerging threat.

"That is why we launched the Joint Fraud Taskforce – which sees the government, law enforcement and industry working together to tackle some of the toughest fraud issues that a single organisation cannot address alone.

“The NAO has said that the creation of the Joint Fraud Taskforce is a positive step – but we know that there is more to do to successfully prevent, disrupt and prosecute fraudsters.

“The Joint Fraud Taskforce is now working to develop a cross-industry strategic plan to specifically tackle fraud where a person’s bank card is being fraudulently used online or over the phone.

“We are also working together to identify what makes a person susceptible to falling victim to fraud in order to reduce an individual’s vulnerability to this.”

Although the government wants the police and judiciary to make greater use of existing laws, the NAO found that stakeholders had mixed views on the adequacy of current legislation.

The international and hidden nature of online fraud makes it difficult to pursue and prosecute criminals because of the need for international cooperation and an ability to take action across borders.

“Although the banking industry has started to raise awareness of fraud, banks are still placing too much responsibility on consumers to spot and protect themselves from sophisticated online scams," says Gareth Shaw, Which? money commentator.

“We’ve heard from many people who have lost life-changing amounts of money through bank transfer fraud, but who have seen little swift action to help them.

“The Government now needs to set out an ambitious agenda to tackle fraud, publish an update on the progress of the Joint Fraud Taskforce and outline what action it will urgently take to safeguard consumers from scams.”

5 ways to protect yourself from financial fraud

1. Never disclose security details, such as your PIN or full banking password

2. Don’t assume an email, text or phone call is authentic

3. Don’t be rushed – a genuine organisation won’t mind waiting

4. Listen to your instincts – you know if something doesn’t feel right

5. Stay in control – don’t panic and make a decision you’ll regret

Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic will be out to complete unfinished business at Wimbledon on Thursday after both were denied a chance to savour match-point glory in their first-round matches.

When seven-times champion Federer takes on Dusan Lajovic and Djokovic faces Adam Pavlasek in round two, they will be hoping to put on an entertaining show from start to finish after Tuesday's fans were left feeling rather short-changed.

Djokovic, winner of three titles here, was leading Martin Klizan 6-3 2-0 when the injured Slovakian went up to shake hands with the Serb after calling time on the match with only 40 minutes on the clock.

Unbelievably for the Centre Court crowd, there were given a repeat performance just over an hour later when Federer's opponent Alexandr Dolgopolov also pulled out when trailing 3-6 0-3.

With a Manchester United and England legend for a father, most people would expect Romeo Beckham to be a pretty promising footballer.

But it seems the 14-year-old is rather more interested in a different sport.

Romeo, David and Victoria’s middle son, is a big tennis fan, and was spotted attending a match at the Aegon Championships last week with his father.

He then had a private tennis lesson with the World No 11 Grigor Dimitrov, which Victoria shared on her Instagram page.

And it would appear Dimitrov was impressed. Speaking after his first round win over Diego Schwartzman, the Bulgarian gave a glowing assessment of Romeo’s game, and said he showed “a lot of potential”.

“Romeo, he's a very talented kid,” Dimitrov said.

“I think he hasn't played tennis for that long, but he sure showed I think a lot of potential.

“It was very nice to spend some time off the court, especially I don't want to say kids, because I like to give a bit of my time as well when they really appreciate something like this."

Dimitrov, who is dating the Pussycat Dolls singer Nicole Scherzinger, also revealed that he is becoming something of a family friend to the Beckhams.

Dimitrov won his first round match at Wimbledon (Getty)

“I just wanted to do something nice for him,” he added.

“He came to quite a few of my matches I think on the days. Yeah, glad to spend also some time with Victoria and get to know the family from close.”

Fabio Fognini is temperamental and doesn’t have the best record on grass – and yet he is dangerous when underestimated. The enigmatic Italian will face Andy Murray in the third round at Wimbledon, hoping to pull one of the greatest upsets of this year’s Championships.

Married to former WTA No.1 Flavia Pentta, the 30-year-old Italian has not achieved as much as his wife during his career. He has never broken into the top 10 of the ATP rankings – peaking at No 13 in 2014 – and his best performance at a grand slam remain a run to the quarter-finals of the French Open in 2011.

But the Italian is a dangerous opponent. He is also an accomplished doubles player, winning the Australian Open in 2015 with his fellow Italian Simone Bolelli, and reaching the semi-finals of the US Open in 2011, and the French Open in 2015.

Murray knows the Italian well as Fognini has managed to upset Murray three times in his career, with the current head-to-head record between the two men locked at 3-3. The last time they played it was Fognini who triumphed, blowing the Scot off the court at the Rome Masters in an impressive 6-2 6-2 win.

In that match he hit a total of 31 winners on his favoured surface of clay, winning the first set in a positively breezy 40 minutes. He made barely any errors and smashed a large number of winners past the World No 1.

Most of those winners were off his mighty forehand, which is arguably his most dangerous weapon. He is quick on the court and excels at baseline play. However, his serve can lack power, with Murray likely to attack his second serve on Wednesday.

Wimbledon Day Three: Murray makes it four Brits into the third round

Theoretically at least, Fognini isn’t a terrible match-up for Murray, as the Scot is one of the finest defensive players in the game and is also an accomplished returner.

The surface should also work in Murray’s favour. All of Fognini’s victories over Murray have come on clay, while the Scot counts grass as his favourite surface. It will give him a considerable advantage on Wednesday.

Murray looks to have recovered from the hip injury he sustained in the build-up to the tournament and made light work of Dustin Brown in the previous round. The German was powerless against Murray and won just 14 points off his serve.

Murray’s consistency could frustrate Fognini, who is known to have something of a short temper. He is also prone to making silly mistakes and holds a record for the number of foot faults committed in a match.

Nevertheless, Fognini says he is ready for the third-round clash and his flair means he is definitely one to watch out for. To make sure of victory, Murray has to make sure he does not allow Fognini to dictate play, and must be wary of the Italian drop-shotting him in an attempt to punish his relative lack of match-fitness.

Alexandre Lacazette is an Arsenal player - but what squad number will he wear?

The 26-year-old finally completed his protracted transfer from home-town club Lyon late on Wednesday afternoon putting pen to paper on a long-term deal with the club.

The transfer will be a club-record deal surpassing the £42.4million paid to Real Madrid for Mesut Ozil in 2013 and could end up as high as £52million.

How could Arsenal line up next season?

2/12 GK: Petr Cech Cech may have been dropped for the FA Cup final, but the experienced shot-stopper is unlikely to lose his Premier League place anytime soon. The goalkeeper will turn 36 next season and yet he remains one of Arsenal’s best players. Getty Images

5/12 CB: Laurent Koscielny His poor discipline cost Arsenal in a couple of vital games, but he remains an important, influential player. There have been rumours Marseille have made Koscielny their top transfer target this summer, but it is highly unlikely Arsenal will sell. Getty Images

6/12 CB: Rob Holding After impressing with his maturity and composure in a back-three last season, there's every chance Arsene Wenger could place his faith in the youngster once again for the new campaign. AFP/Getty Images

8/12 CDM: Granit Xhaka Attracted a lot of criticism for his displays last season, but grew in confidence throughout the campaign and has the talent to become a vital player for Arsenal over the coming seasons. A superb distributor of the ball. Getty Images

9/12 CM: Santi Cazorla One of Arsenal's most technically-gifted players and the glue that keeps the side's midfield together. Doubts over his fitness and whether he's got another season left in him, but should he be firing on all cylinders Wenger will want to make full use of him. Getty Images

10/12 LCM: Mesut Ozil Still negotiating a contract extension with the club. His performance levels dipped alarmingly last season, but when he is in form, he remains one of the finest passers of the ball in the world. Getty Images

11/12 RCM: Riyad Mahrez Mahrez recently announced his intentions to leave Leicester this summer and Wenger refused to rule out a move for the Premier League champion. Mahrez would bring real flair to Arsenal's side, as well as the ability to make something out of nothing. Getty Images

12/12 CF: Alexandre Lacazette The instinctive centre-forward that Arsenal have longed for ever since RVP's departure. Industrious and physical, he'd bring a tough edge to Arsenal's front line. Getty

France forward Lacazette netted 37 goals in all competitions last season and becomes the Gunners' second major summer addition following the arrival of left-back Sead Kolasinac on a free transfer from Schalke.

Arsenal are yet to reveal what squad number Lacazette will wear but a closer look at the squad can offer a few clues.

If given free choice then the former Lyon striker would likely choose No.10, a number he wore with no little success during his time in France. That jersey number is currently held by Jack Wilshere who's own future at the club is far less than certain.

No.9 is currently owned by Lucas Perez but with the £18m failing to force his way into Arsene Wenger's first team plans since arriving in January it is likely he will leave this summer with former club Deportivo La Coruna interested in taking him back.

Arsenal summer transfer targets







7 show all Arsenal summer transfer targets











1/7 Thomas Lemar (Monaco) Age: 21

Position: Left-wing

Likelihood: 5/10



After their eye-catching run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Monaco are being gutted by European football’s elite. One of their many bright young things is Lemar, who would slot right into Alexis Sanchez’s left-sided role at Arsenal should the Chilean leave the Emirates this summer. The problem? Monaco are not selling, or at least not for Arsenal’s reported initial offer of £30.75m. Getty

2/7 Alexandre Lacazette (Lyon) Age: 26

Position: Striker

Likelihood: 5/10



Last summer saw Arsenal attempt to sign Lacazette, only for Lyon to refuse to sell the “irreplaceable” striker. This summer, Lacazette’s exit looks more likely but Jean Michel Aulas, the Ligue 1 club’s president, is sending out mixed messages. One day he says Lacazette is free to leave if a replacement is found, the next he says Lacazette is likely to stay. Granted, those are not necessarily contradictory statements, but it leaves Arsenal hoping that Lyon can fill a Lacazette-shaped hole before any move is made. Getty

3/7 Kylian Mbappé (Monaco) Age: 18

Position: Left/right-wing

Likelihood: 3/10



Another Monaco player, Mbappé is one of the hottest properties in Europe and is perhaps a surprise inclusion on the list, with many expecting the teenager to move to Real Madrid, if anywhere, this summer. Arsène Wenger is said to have struck up something of an accord with the lightning quick winger’s family and harbours hopes of convincing Thierry Henry’s rightful heir that north London is the best place for his development. Getty

4/7 Riyad Mahrez (Leicester) Age: 26

Position: Right-wing

Likelihood: 4/10



It is no secret that Wenger is a long-time admirer of Mahrez, whose stock has fallen somewhat following that remarkable title-winning campaign with Leicester City in 2015/16. While some of Europe’s top clubs were hovering around the Algerian this time last year, the coast is now relatively clear. The only worry is whether Mahrez can recreate the scintillating form he began to show two years ago. Getty

5/7 Jean Michaël Seri (Nice) Age: 25

Position: Centre-midfield

Likelihood: 5/10



Seri was one of Nice’s stand-out players during their surprise challenge for the Ligue 1 title last term. If Santi Cazorla’s injury woes continue into the new season, the Cote d’Ivoire international could prove to be an ideal replacement, but his performances in the south of France have not gone unnoticed. Roma, Southampton, Tottenham and Leicester have all been keeping tabs on the midfielder. Getty

6/7 Mario Lemina (Juventus) Age: 23

Position: Centre-midfield

Likelihood: 3/10



Gabon international Lemina is in search of regular playing time away from Turin, where he has struggled to establish himself in Max Allegri’s first-choice XI. “I want to play more,” he said in June. “I think it's right for me to play more, find a club capable of giving me more space. At 23 I want to show what I can do.” Could he find the minutes he needs in north London? At the moment, there seems to be little concrete about Arsenal’s reported ‘interest’. Getty

7/7 Aleksandr Golovin (CSKA Moscow) Age: 21

Position: Centre-midfield

Likelihood: 2/10



Another midfielder whose name has been bandied around in the gossip columns this summer, but with few solid leads for transfer-hungry supporters to pursue. Any deal for the talented CSKA Moscow academy graduate would likely involve him being loaned back to his current club, if indeed any such deal is likely at all. Getty

Another option could be No.7, a number that would be freed up should Alexis Sanchez, a target for Manchester City, choose to walk away.

The Gunners boast one of the largest squads in the Premier League with 27 and 30 the only numbers available for Lacazette currently pending summer departures.

Heather Watson is within touching distance of achieving her long-term goal of reaching the second week of a grand slam - which could be bad news for coach Morgan Phillips.

Watson produced one of her best performances at Wimbledon with a 6-0 6-4 win over 18th seed Anastasija Sevastova to make the third round for the third time.

She has never gone further either here or at any other slam - also making the last 32 at Wimbledon in 2012 and 2015 and at the Australian Open in 2013.

Should she beat former world number one Victoria Azarenka on Friday, Phillips will have to honour an uncomfortable promise.

Watson said: "It's been one of my goals forever. I made those big goals years ago. Making second week of a slam would be huge for me.

"And if I do, my coach said he'd shave his head. But I said, 'No, your girlfriend will kill you. You can shave your legs."'

It has been a difficult 12 months for Watson, who struggled after losing a close match in the first round at Wimbledon last year and had been unable to find any momentum.

She dropped out of the top 100 and failed to qualify for the French Open but things finally came together again in Eastbourne last week, where she reached the semi-finals.

Watson has spent much of the last year without a regular coach and credits Phillips and Colin Beecher, who she began working with at the start of the clay season, for helping her turn things around.

She said: "I'm happy with them. Practices are going really well. I feel like I have structure. I'm enjoying it, which is the most important part.

"But it makes me want to work hard, as well. I feel like my tennis is just really improving at the moment."

Wimbledon Day Three: Murray makes it four Brits into the third round

Watson is no stranger to ups and downs having broken into the top 50 in 2012 only to tumble back into triple figures after struggling with glandular fever.

She then rose to a career-high mark of 38 in January 2015 before slipping down again.

While Watson stopped short of empathising too much with Bernard Tomic after his claim that he was bored during his first-round match, she has experienced her own struggles with motivation.

The 25-year-old said: "I'm not motivated every week. I think that's normal. It's very hard to be.

"But you have to find that motivation in the weeks where it's harder, where you're in a random country, all the way on the back courts, nobody's watching. It's tougher. It's very different. It's easy to be motivated here for me.

"It's just like telling somebody to be happy every single week. That's not life. There's highs and lows to everything you do. For me the highs are really high."

Currently ranked 102, Watson will climb back into double figures after a superb performance against the fast-rising Sevastova, who won the warm-up tournament in Majorca.

She did not put a foot wrong in a first set that lasted only 19 minutes, not making a single unforced error.

Sevastova looked out of ideas, with Watson giving short shrift to her favoured drop shots, but the British player's level dropped a little at the start of the second.

Watson trailed by a break at 3-1 and then 4-3 but a break to love of the Sevastova serve in the eighth game proved the crucial blow to the Latvian's resolve.

"Starts are very important, but I'm really happy with the second set because she raised her level," said Watson.

"The first set I just felt great, pretty flawless. It's always going to change. I've got to expect her to raise her level and to try something new, and she did.

"I was pleased with how I remained calm and just kept doing what I was doing."

Now Watson must try to win her first match in five attempts against Azarenka, who claimed the best win of her comeback so far 6-3 6-3 against Elena Vesnina.

This summer's transfer window could be one of the most exciting ever with some of world football's biggest names set for moves.

Cristiano Ronaldo, Alexis Sanchez, Kylian Mbappe and Alvaro Morata are just a handful of big-name players tipped for a move this summer, with the likes of Jose Mourinho, Arsene Wenger and Antonio Conte all eager to bolster their squads ahead of the new season.

Rather impressively, a number of clubs have already set about their business early. Manchester City are the summer’s early pace setters, having already signed both Bernardo Silva and Ederson, while Mohamed Salah recently joined Liverpool in a £34.3m move from Roma.

How Manchester United could line up next season

1/12 How could United line up? Jose Mourinho's side have been linked with dozens of new signings, but who is most likely to line up for the club in time for the start of the 2017/18 season? Getty

2/12 Goalkeeper – David De Gea Reports in Spain now suggest De Gea will stay at United once again as Real Madrid have failed to convince the club to sell. Getty

3/12 Right back – Fabinho Jose Mourinho is a fan of Fabinho, who can play at both right-back and as a defensive midfielder. Monaco, however, do not want to lose many of the first-team stars which took them to a Champions League semi-final last season. Getty

4/12 Centre-back – Eric Bailly Bailly had a phenomenal first season at United and looks like he will be the bedrock of Mourinho’s defence for the foreseeable future. Getty

5/12 Centre-back – Victor Lindelof Victor Lindelof has joined the club from Benfica and will start in the heart of United's defence. Getty

6/12 Left-back – Kieran Tierney Mourinho is not a fan of Luke Shaw and Matteo Darmian looked unconvincing when deployed as a left-back last season. United could turn to £15m rated Celtic defender Kieran Tierney, who has established himself for both his club and country despite only being 20-years-old. United scouts were spotted watching the player in England's recent World Cup qualifier against Scotland. Getty

7/12 Midfield - Ander Herrera A fan favourite at Old Trafford, Herrera's tenacious performances in the middle of the park last season saw his stock rise immeasurably. With Wayne Rooney's days numbered, the Spaniard may be in line to take the captain's armband. Getty

8/12 Midfield – Nemanja Matic The signing of Matic is one that screams not only of the need for discipline in the heart of this United team, but one that reiterates how the Portuguese is looking for players who can help him win now, not a couple of years down the line. Getty

9/12 Midfield – Paul Pogba Mourinho is known to want to bring in a defensive midfielder in order to free up the Frenchman to operate further up the field. Getty

10/12 Left-wing - Marcus Rashford The young English forward has done enough to earn Mourinho's trust and should be used in the first XI far more next term. Getty

11/12 Right-wing – Ivan Perisic United are only willing to spend £35m on Perisic but Inter want £50m. The club are still confident they can push the deal through. Getty

12/12 Striker - Romelu Lukaku Mourinho has prioritised a new No.9 this summer following Zlatan Ibrahimovic's season-ending injury and subsequent release and has opted for Lukaku as his top choice. Getty Images

Arsenal finally completed the club record deal for Alexandre Lacazette to go with left-back Sead Kolasinac while Everton are the other big spenders so far in the window, signing Michael Keane for a club-record £30m and Sandro Ramirez to add to Jordan Pickford from Sunderland for £30m and Ajax’s Davy Klaassen for £23.6m.

Rafael Nadal reached the third round of Wimbledon for the first time since 2014 after the Spaniard cruised past American Donald Young in straight sets.

Nadal endured a second-round loss to Dustin Brown in 2015 and missed last year's tournament through injury, but his bid to secure a 16th grand slam title this fortnight was never put in danger on Centre Court.

He needed just over two hours to see off Young 6-4 6-2 7-5 and the world number two will now face the talented Russian Karen Khachanov for a place in the last 16.

Meanwhile defending champion Andy Murray made short work of former giant-killer Brown to keep his Wimbledon title defence on track.

The world number one showed no signs of the hip problems which hindered his build-up to Wimbledon in a routine 6-3 6-2 6-2 win over his dreadlocked opponent from Germany.

Murray was joined in round three by seventh seed Marin Cilic of Croatia, a 7-6 (7/2) 6-4 7-5 winner over Germany's Florian Mayer.

England international striker Toni Duggan has swapped Manchester City Women for Barcelona in a landmark transfer.

The 25-year-old former Everton forward has agreed a two-year deal with the Spanish side and moves with immediate effect.

Duggan told her new club's website: "For me, FC Barcelona is the biggest club in the world and naturally I wanted to come here and be part of it.

"I have had a lot of success in England but I want to have even more. I think I need another trophy on my list and I know that Barca's ambition is to win the Champions League. This is my goal too."

Duggan becomes only the second English player in history to join the La Liga giants following in the footsteps of Gary Lineker.

A pro-Isis channel on the Telegram instant messaging service has called for a Manchester-style “lone wolf attack” to be carried out at Wimbledon, an intelligence security service has claimed.

In May, the terrorist group claimed responsibility for the Manchester Arena bombing attack, which killed 23 people and injured 250 others.The bomber, Salman Ramadan Abedi, was a 22-year-old British Sunni Muslim who acted largely alone.

An intelligence group has now claimed that a pro-Isis channel has been calling for attackers to target The Wimbledon Championships, which began on Monday and culminate in the men’s final on Sunday 16 June.

SITE Intelligence Group told the International Business Times that they had monitored a map of the venue being distributed on the channel, along with messages calling on fundamentalists to target the tennis tournament.

“A pro-Islamic State (IS) Telegram channel incited for lone-wolf attacks during the Wimbledon Tennis Tournament, sharing a map of the venue and suggesting for them to 'copycat' the May 22, 2017 Manchester Arena bombing,” the Intelligence Group said.

The channel, called “Lone Mujahid”, also called on attackers to take inspiration from the Manchester attack, and the messages included pictures of the Manchester Arena in the aftermath of the attack on the venue.

Wimbledon Day Three: Murray makes it four Brits into the third round

Security at The Championships has been stepped up this summer, in the wake of terrorist attacks in London and Manchester.

At the beginning of the tournament, the All England Lawn Tennis Club announced that they had enhanced security measures in around this year’s Championships.

“The AELTC works closely with the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) and other relevant organisations to ensure that security measures at The Championships are commensurate with the existing threat level in the UK,” a statement on their website read.

“Working from a strong base of existing measures in place from previous years, covering extensive searches of people, bags and vehicles on entry to the Grounds, the placement of vehicle mitigation, wide CCTV coverage, armed and uniformed Police officers and sniffer dogs, this year's Championships will see a proportional uplift in measures in place on the advice of, and working in partnership with, the Metropolitan Police Service.

“There will be visible physical security around the Queue, in the form of vehicle mitigation barriers, as part of this enhanced security operation.”

Signing balls and programmes is common enough for tennis players, but Rafael Nadal got asked to autograph a prosthetic leg on Wednesday evening.

The 10-time French Open champion had won his second-round Wimbledon match against American Donald Young 6-4, 6-2, 7-5 when he was presented with the strange request.

Amid the usual fans clamouring for a signature was a man who handed the Spanish player a prosthetic leg, complete with a blue trainer on the end.

Nadal said it was probably not the "weirdest" thing he had ever had to sign.

When asked if the leg was removed specially for the star to sign, Nadal said:

"Was already off. I don't know if he took it off at that moment or not."

Wimbledon tweeted out a clip of the incident, with the caption: "Not your everyday request..."

It came the day after a man snatched a towel from a boy's hands when American player Jack Sock threw it into the crowd.

Manchester United are set to make Romelu Lukaku the second most expensive player in British football history after agreeing a fee of £75million with Everton.

Jose Mourinho has prioritised a new No.9 this summer following Zlatan Ibrahimovic's season-ending injury and subsequent release and has opted for Lukaku as his top choice.

Personal terms are expected to be a formality with the club hopeful the 24-year-old will be on the plane to Los Angeles on Sunday ahead of their pre-season tour of the United States.

Premier League transfer-round up: Arsenal seal Lacazette deal

Lukaku joins Victor Lindelof as Untied's second signing of the summer with more expected as manager Mourinho attempts to build a squad capable of challenging both in the Premier League and the Champions League next term.

Mourinho is keen to add a defensive midfielder with Chelsea's Nemanja Matic the next likeliest arrival with the club still retaining an interest in Fabinho of Monaco, a player Mourinho believes is versatile enough to improve his squad in a number of areas.

An attacking wide player is also a priority while departures including club captain Wayne Rooney could see further new faces arrive.

Roger Federer will be out to complete unfinished business at Wimbledon on Thursday after he was denied a chance to savour match-point glory in his first-round match.

Seven-times champion Federer takes on Dusan Lajovic in round two, and will be hoping to put on an entertaining show from start to finish after Tuesday's fans were left feeling rather short-changed.

Federer's opponent, Alexandr Dolgopolov, pulled out when trailing 3-6 0-3, to hand Federer an easy route into the second round.

Here’s everything you need to know as Federer attempts to make it into the third round for the fourth successive year.

What time is it?

Federer is last up on Centre Court, after Kyle Edmund’s match against Gael Monfils, and Karolina Pliskova’s against Magdalena Rybarikova.

Expect to see Fed out on court around 5pm.

Where can I watch it?

The match will be live on BBC One.

Who is Dusan Lajovic?

Lajovic has never before played Federer (Getty)



A 27-year-old Slovenia, who excels on clay. He has reached two ATP finals – losing at the Vegeta Croatia Open in 2014 and winning the Istanbul Open a year later – and reached the fourth round of the French Open in 2014.

However, he’s only made it past the first round of Wimbledon once before, in 2014, when he lost to Poland’s Łukasz Kubot in four sets in the second.

What’s the head to head record?

The pair have never player against one another before.

What has Federer been saying?

Roger Federer serves in his Wimbledon first-round victory ( Getty )

“The thing what's nice about when you're not playing tournaments is that you're in charge of your daily routines. If you're carrying an injury, well, you don't have to practice. If you don't feel so well, you're sick, whatever, you don't have to play through it. That's nice about it.

“But, of course, at the end I'm a tennis player, I'm a match player, that's why I want to be. Sometimes you have to reset to come back there.

“I just think for me to have this sort of really, like, big distance to actually playing matches and understanding that I won't be around for a long time, really put me in a place where I could really relax and do other things, not think about tennis day-to-day.”

What are the odds?

Roger Federer to win: 1/100

Manchester United have agreed a £75m fee with Everton for the transfer of Romelu Lukaku.

The Belgian international must now agree on personal terms with the Old Trafford club if he is to complete a move, but the Europa League winners will face competition from Chelsea.

Jose Mourinho had prioritised the signing of Antoine Griezmann after Zlatan Ibrahimovic was released this summer, but when he decided to stay at Atletico Madrid, United turned their attention to Alvaro Morata. While the Spanish international was keen to move, United failed to agree a fee with Real Madrid - who were pushing for €90m - and their interest ended late on Wednesday night when they felt a deal had become impossible.

1/12 How could United line up? Jose Mourinho's side have been linked with dozens of new signings, but who is most likely to line up for the club in time for the start of the 2017/18 season? Getty

2/12 Goalkeeper – David De Gea Reports in Spain now suggest De Gea will stay at United once again as Real Madrid have failed to convince the club to sell. Getty

3/12 Right back – Fabinho Jose Mourinho is a fan of Fabinho, who can play at both right-back and as a defensive midfielder. Monaco, however, do not want to lose many of the first-team stars which took them to a Champions League semi-final last season. Getty

4/12 Centre-back – Eric Bailly Bailly had a phenomenal first season at United and looks like he will be the bedrock of Mourinho’s defence for the foreseeable future. Getty

5/12 Centre-back – Victor Lindelof Victor Lindelof has joined the club from Benfica and will start in the heart of United's defence. Getty

6/12 Left-back – Kieran Tierney Mourinho is not a fan of Luke Shaw and Matteo Darmian looked unconvincing when deployed as a left-back last season. United could turn to £15m rated Celtic defender Kieran Tierney, who has established himself for both his club and country despite only being 20-years-old. United scouts were spotted watching the player in England's recent World Cup qualifier against Scotland. Getty

7/12 Midfield - Ander Herrera A fan favourite at Old Trafford, Herrera's tenacious performances in the middle of the park last season saw his stock rise immeasurably. With Wayne Rooney's days numbered, the Spaniard may be in line to take the captain's armband. Getty

8/12 Midfield – Nemanja Matic The signing of Matic is one that screams not only of the need for discipline in the heart of this United team, but one that reiterates how the Portuguese is looking for players who can help him win now, not a couple of years down the line. Getty

9/12 Midfield – Paul Pogba Mourinho is known to want to bring in a defensive midfielder in order to free up the Frenchman to operate further up the field. Getty

10/12 Left-wing - Marcus Rashford The young English forward has done enough to earn Mourinho's trust and should be used in the first XI far more next term. Getty

11/12 Right-wing – Ivan Perisic United are only willing to spend £35m on Perisic but Inter want £50m. The club are still confident they can push the deal through. Getty

12/12 Striker - Romelu Lukaku Mourinho has prioritised a new No.9 this summer following Zlatan Ibrahimovic's season-ending injury and subsequent release and has opted for Lukaku as his top choice. Getty Images

United have now moved on and quickly agreed a deal for Lukaku, whose agent Mino Raiola last summer brought Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Paul Pogba to the club.

Should Lukaku become a United player, he will become the second-biggest buy in Premier League history after Pogba.

Chelsea, however, will make it difficult and have been in talks with Lukaku's representatives. The Blues' technical director Michael Emenalo is a huge fan of the 24-year-old striker but that deal is in the hands of transfer negotiator Marina Granovskaia and, without any doubt, the Manchester club have stolen a march on the west Londoners.

Wayne Rooney remains almost certain to head in the other direction but the Old Trafford club are keen to keep negotiations separate.

Alexandre Lacazette has revealed he always dreamed of joining Arsenal and pledged to help them win titles after sealing his club-record move from Lyon.

The French international became the Gunners second summer signing on Wednesday, following the free transfer arrival of Sead Kolasinac from Schalke, penning a long-term deal at the Emirates.

The 26-year-old is expected to add some much-needed cutting edge after grabbing 37 goals in all competitions last term and upon putting pen to paper he explained what he thinks he will bring to the side.

12/12 CF: Alexandre Lacazette The instinctive centre-forward that Arsenal have longed for ever since RVP's departure. Industrious and physical, he'd bring a tough edge to Arsenal's front line. Getty

"I am of course delighted and very proud too because Arsenal is a legendary club. Throughout my childhood, thanks to Thierry Henry and other French players, I always dreamed of playing for this club so today that dream has been fulfilled," he told the club's official website.

"Arsenal is also the club which plays the best football in England, so I really wanted to come here."

Lacazette continued: "When I play I like to use my pace and to link up with my team-mates. As a forward of course I like to score goals, but that is not all that I am about. I love good flowing football where the whole team is engaged. First of all you need to have players behind you who pass the ball well, resulting in good goalscoring opportunities.

"I want to give 100% in every match. I want to show I am worthy of the shirt. I want to do everything I can to make sure we win titles."

Lacazette has penned a long-term deal with the club (Getty)



Gunners boss Wenger is in no doubt of what Lacazette can add to the squad.

"We are very happy to have Alexandre join our group. He has shown over a number of years that he can score goals and that he is a very efficient finisher. As well, he has very interesting technical qualities and a strong character," Wenger said on the club's official website.

Arsenal summer transfer targets







7 show all Arsenal summer transfer targets











1/7 Thomas Lemar (Monaco) Age: 21

Position: Left-wing

Likelihood: 5/10



After their eye-catching run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Monaco are being gutted by European football’s elite. One of their many bright young things is Lemar, who would slot right into Alexis Sanchez’s left-sided role at Arsenal should the Chilean leave the Emirates this summer. The problem? Monaco are not selling, or at least not for Arsenal’s reported initial offer of £30.75m. Getty

2/7 Alexandre Lacazette (Lyon) Age: 26

Position: Striker

Likelihood: 5/10



Last summer saw Arsenal attempt to sign Lacazette, only for Lyon to refuse to sell the “irreplaceable” striker. This summer, Lacazette’s exit looks more likely but Jean Michel Aulas, the Ligue 1 club’s president, is sending out mixed messages. One day he says Lacazette is free to leave if a replacement is found, the next he says Lacazette is likely to stay. Granted, those are not necessarily contradictory statements, but it leaves Arsenal hoping that Lyon can fill a Lacazette-shaped hole before any move is made. Getty

3/7 Kylian Mbappé (Monaco) Age: 18

Position: Left/right-wing

Likelihood: 3/10



Another Monaco player, Mbappé is one of the hottest properties in Europe and is perhaps a surprise inclusion on the list, with many expecting the teenager to move to Real Madrid, if anywhere, this summer. Arsène Wenger is said to have struck up something of an accord with the lightning quick winger’s family and harbours hopes of convincing Thierry Henry’s rightful heir that north London is the best place for his development. Getty

4/7 Riyad Mahrez (Leicester) Age: 26

Position: Right-wing

Likelihood: 4/10



It is no secret that Wenger is a long-time admirer of Mahrez, whose stock has fallen somewhat following that remarkable title-winning campaign with Leicester City in 2015/16. While some of Europe’s top clubs were hovering around the Algerian this time last year, the coast is now relatively clear. The only worry is whether Mahrez can recreate the scintillating form he began to show two years ago. Getty

5/7 Jean Michaël Seri (Nice) Age: 25

Position: Centre-midfield

Likelihood: 5/10



Seri was one of Nice’s stand-out players during their surprise challenge for the Ligue 1 title last term. If Santi Cazorla’s injury woes continue into the new season, the Cote d’Ivoire international could prove to be an ideal replacement, but his performances in the south of France have not gone unnoticed. Roma, Southampton, Tottenham and Leicester have all been keeping tabs on the midfielder. Getty

6/7 Mario Lemina (Juventus) Age: 23

Position: Centre-midfield

Likelihood: 3/10



Gabon international Lemina is in search of regular playing time away from Turin, where he has struggled to establish himself in Max Allegri’s first-choice XI. “I want to play more,” he said in June. “I think it's right for me to play more, find a club capable of giving me more space. At 23 I want to show what I can do.” Could he find the minutes he needs in north London? At the moment, there seems to be little concrete about Arsenal’s reported ‘interest’. Getty

7/7 Aleksandr Golovin (CSKA Moscow) Age: 21

Position: Centre-midfield

Likelihood: 2/10



Another midfielder whose name has been bandied around in the gossip columns this summer, but with few solid leads for transfer-hungry supporters to pursue. Any deal for the talented CSKA Moscow academy graduate would likely involve him being loaned back to his current club, if indeed any such deal is likely at all. Getty

"He is a guy who is a great addition for us, and someone who will help us challenge at the top level this season."

Lacazette is expected to be part of the squad which heads to Australia and then China on tour this weekend, with a home debut likely in the Emirates Cup at the end of July.

I just no way that crude oil, either on the West Texas Intermediate or the Brent Crude levels, will break out above the $45 to $55 range. And therefore that's gonna keep energy stocks locked in."

Subway already has 2,500 stores in the region. The company said it's expanding in response to consumer demand. Britain's food-to-go market is growing quickly. It is forecast to be worth nearly $29 billion by 2021, according to industry research group IGD. Technomic's David Henkes: (SOUNDBITE) DAVID HENKES, SENIOR PRINCIPAL, ADVISORY GROUP (ENGLISH) SAYING: "It's pretty clear from Subway's results here in the United States, that they're looking for growth externally. The U.S. is a very saturated market, and Subway is by far the largest restaurant chain in the United States, so growth here has been challenging, so, whether it's Europe, Asia, or other parts of the globe, Subway is clearly looking at international opportunities as a way to continue the growth trajectory, and it certainly makes sense from that perspective." Subway's expansion in the UK comes after the company closed 359 restaurants in the United States last year. Subway is owned by a U.S.-based firm Doctor's Associates. It operates as a franchise. Globally it has more than 44,000 outlets in 112 countries.

It's one of the biggest business deals in a long time for Airbus. The aircraft manufacturer is selling 140 of its planes to China. Including its A320 and A350 aircraft.. a deal worth almost 23 billion dollars. The planes will be bought by a state-owned aviation company..And then allocated to Chinese airlines. It's the first major news from Airbus since the company's restructure.. And merge of its parent company and its dominant planemaking arm. More deals could also be on the way.. China is said to be interested in Airbus's A380 superjumbo.. That would be a welcome boost to the company's new jet airliner... Which has recently seen sales stall.

Not everyone likes globalisation .... Though China's new loan to Berlin zoo don't seem to mind it .... And Germany and the EU are sending out strong signals they still want it - with or without Donald Trump and the US. Angela Merkel plays host to the Chinese president - agreeing to cooperate on aerospace - and crucially, trade. In Brussels, EU and Japanese officials are already ahead - as they move towards a full free trade deal. (SOUNDBITE) (English) FIDELITY INTERNATIONAL, INVESTMENT DIRECTOR, TOM STEVENSON, SAYING: What we're seeing ... is really a very heavy message aimed at President Trump that the world of protectionism which he envisages is not acceptable to the rest of the world. For the EU, it means striking agreements in potentially tricky markets - like Japanese cars and European farm produce. But the desire to compromise does appear to be there. (SOUNDBITE) (English) EUROPEAN BUSINESS LOBBY GROUP BUSINESSEUROPE DIRECTOR, LUISA SANTOS, SAYING: It is important if the EU and Japan conclude this agreement just before the G20 Summit. It will be an important political sign also for other economies that trade is good. For a German leader who sees her country as a beacon of human rights, it may also mean compromise. (SOUNDBITE) (English) FIDELITY INTERNATIONAL, INVESTMENT DIRECTOR, TOM STEVENSON, SAYING: Angela Merkel is very keen to keep open those those avenues to China and perhaps she's having to swallow things which he's less comfortable with in having those discussions with President Xi. After a new missile test on the Korean peninsula this week - there are other global challenges too where the EU could do with a helping Chinese hand. Though what might win all sides over in the end is the bare necessities .... A deal between Japan and the EU could boost joint trade by a third, say officials. Merkel, in the meantime, keen for a quick signing of an investment treaty that could also turn into a full-blown free trade agreement.

The U.S. government sought to intervene in Apple's tax troubles in Europe, a source told Reuters. Last August, the European Commission said Apple had received illegal tax breaks in Ireland, and it ordered the company to pay back close to $15 billion. The decision was criticized by the Obama administration. Trump's White House has not said anything in public about the case. In December, Apple appealed the EC decision in the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second-highest. This is where the U.S. government filed its application to intervene in the case. The court is expected to hear the case in late 2018. Apple is not the only U. S. company in the EU crosshairs over tax deals. Others include Amazon, McDonald's, and Starbucks.

Volvo is going all-in on clean cars. The Swedish firm saying all new models after 2019 will be electric or hybrids. That makes it the first big automaker to set a date for phasing out traditional engines. (SOUNDBITE) (English) CHAIRMAN OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD OF VOLVO CARS CORPORATION HAKAN SAMUELSSON SAYING: "We are reacting to customer demand, asking for electrified cars and of course it is also the way for us to cut down when it comes to C02 levels and reducing our carbon footprint." Here's one reason for the Volvo move. Elon Musk's Tesla brand enjoying a sales boom. Its new Model 3 going into full production this week - having already racked up over 300-thousand orders. The company credited with making electric cars not only credible, but desirable. Volvo wants to get in on the action: SOUNDBITE (English) REUTERS REPORTER, NICK POLLARD SAYING: "Under Geely ownership Volvo has been moving upmarket, becoming more of a luxury car that can take on rivals such as Daimler's Mercedes Benz and BMW / So what they're doing now is adding a technological trend that is really prevalent in the car industry, which is electrification, and that again will go back to define Volvo as a car not only the old school safe Volvo but also a more luxurious and cutting edge car." Volvo will continue to sell petrol and diesel cars developed before 2019. But there will be no new investment in traditional engines. Another sign, perhaps, that the era of the gas guzzler is coming to an end.

Everyone loves a bargain - especially when Brexit pushes up the pound. And, seemingly, pushes down the UK economy. The latest PMI completes an unhappy trio this week of manufacturing, construction and now services. All coming in below forecasts. (SOUNDBITE) (English) FIDELITY INTERNATIONAL, INVESTMENT DIRECTOR, TOM STEVENSON, SAYING: "The evidence is that the consumer is slowing down very rapidly. What we're not yet seeing is a sufficient uptick in business investment and trade to offset that." At a four-month low of 53.4 in June for services, it still points to expansion. But the forward-looking expectations index was weaker than it's been since just after last June's Brexit vote. (SOUNDBITE) (English) FIDELITY INTERNATIONAL, INVESTMENT DIRECTOR, TOM STEVENSON, SAYING: "The honeymoon period that we enjoyed post referendum has really come off the boil ... And ahead of the Brexit negotiations that's a real problem because we now face two years at least of difficult conditions for the U.K. economy." There are bargains in the euro zone - but perhaps less of a rush for them. New data for May shows retail sales up 2.6 per cent on the year. That's higher than forecast. As is the euro zone's composite PMI for services and manufacturing. At 56.3 for June, it's still close to a six-year high. (SOUNDBITE) (English) FIDELITY INTERNATIONAL, INVESTMENT DIRECTOR, TOM STEVENSON, SAYING: "The interesting thing about the numbers is quite how broad based they are. We're seeing recoveries really right the way across the euro zone and across different sectors but particularly the service sector which of course is so important." After recent hints from Mario Draghi, economists see the ECB edging closer to tightening its ultra-loose stimulus programme. That's showing no signs of spoiling the sentiment just yet .... New business is strong - and survey compilers IHS tip a healthy 0.7 per cent upswing in growth this quarter. That too above previous forecasts.

It's been through a lot in its 545 year history and things could be looking up again for the world's oldest bank. Italy's Monte dei Paschi says a return to profit is now on the horizon... After the European Commission approved a restructuring plan.. including a 5.4 billion euro government bailout. (SOUNDBITE) (English) FIDELITY INTERNATIONAL, INVESTMENT DIRECTOR, TOM STEVENSON, SAYING: "Question marks still remain about the legality and the wisdom of allowing the Italian state to bailout its banks, it will after all take a 70 percent stake in Monte Dei Paschi." Monte dei Paschi has been at the forefront of Italy's banking crisis. Burdened by bad loans and a mismanagement scandal. In the past week, Rome has begun to try and turn it, and other ailing banks around. Bailing them out, to the tune of more than 20 billion euros. Despite new EU rules which object to the practice. (SOUNDBITE) (English) FIDELITY INTERNATIONAL, INVESTMENT DIRECTOR, TOM STEVENSON, SAYING: "Clearly there are voices within the euro zone, particularly in Germany, which are unhappy about state aid being used to bailout banks. What's interesting is the long shadow that the financial crisis continues to cast over the European banking system." Since then, only Greece, has seen such big state bailouts. Monte Dei Paschi has promised reform though.. Including cutting thousands of jobs, hundreds of branches... And selling more than 28 billion euros of bad loans with the help of a bank rescue fund.

It's already a force to be reckoned with in Spain. Now Gas Natural reportedly has plans to move into Portugal. Reuters sources say the Barcelona-based power and gas company has approached rival EDP about merging. Together they'd be Europe's fourth biggest utility by market value behind France's Engie and EDF and not far behind Enel and Iberdrola . EDP CEO Antonio Mexia has apparently been contacted by Gas Natural's Chairman and the potential deal would be worth 35 billion euros. It could also trigger a wave of consolidation among the region's big utilities. Many are seeking to gain scale and shift their revenue streams towards renewables to protect profits from steep competition and narrower margins. Local media is reporting that EDP has denied talks have taken place. But a Gas Natural-EDP merger is seen as a good strategic fit The two have a complementary footprint. The Spanish firm is strong in Chile and Mexico - while the Portuguese group is strong in Brazil and the United States.

It hasn't always been a friendly welcome for ride-hailing app Uber in Europe.... And now it's facing a fresh setback. The European Court advising Tuesday that France was entitled to charge local Uber managers with running an illegal taxi service. It concerns its unlicensed chaffeur option UberPOP. Judges will make a final ruling later this year. (SOUNDBITE) (French) ADVOCATE GENERAL AT THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE, YVES BOT, SAYING: "The law prohibits a system which puts customers in touch with people who carry passengers in contravention of the rules which apply to such transport activities." Uber has revolutionised the taxi industry and challenged transportation regulations worldwide. But it hasn't been easy. Many of its ventures have met with angry protests by taxi operators concerned for their future. It faced legal action over UberPOP in France in 2015.... And discontinued the service. It now only operates with licensed cab drivers in many of its main European markets. The U.S. tech giant says the case only concerns a service it no longer provides. The court battle comes at a tumultuous time for the U.S. tech company, with chief executive Travis Kalanick forced to stand down last month. He'd been under pressure from investors after a string of setbacks, as well as probes into a culture of sexism at the firm.

How will Joe Root be feeling this morning? He has probably slept fitfully. His mind will have been working overtime, thinking of possible permutations, worrying about what he should say to his team. But he won’t be weary; he’ll be nervous, excited, proud, anxious and self-conscious to some degree, as he arrives at the ground and recognises that there is a little more attention on him than usual.

If he is sensible, he will have done his administrative duties ahead of time: tickets on the gate for family and friends (the latter tend to increase when you take on the captaincy), team sheet sorted, and signed in good time. Before the players gather on the outfield at the appointed hour (usually 9.45am) he should have…

The famous, posed Reichstag photograph overlooked the role of Grigory Bulatov, who had hoised the flag two days earlier Yevgeny Khaldei/Getty Images

A campaign is growing in Russia for a Red Army private to be recognised as the first person to raise a Soviet flag over the Reichstag in Berlin in 1945.

Two soldiers captured in a photograph on top of the shattered building on May 2 are often mistakenly thought to be the heroes who hoisted the banner, signalling the imminent defeat of the Nazis.

That image was posed by the army photographer Yevgeny Khaldei with the help of men he found by chance at the scene after the building was secured, and with a flag he provided himself.

Grigory Bulatov, nearest the camera, was nominated for a Hero of the Soviet Union award but was given a lesser honour

According to the official story, the feat was carried out by two other men, Meliton Kantaria, a Georgian, and Mikhail Yegorov, a Russian, who were made Heroes…

Michel Barnier said that he was uncertain whether the realities of leaving the EU are fully understood in Britain Getty Images

Michel Barnier, the European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator, has warned cabinet ministers, MPs and British businesses that “frictionless” trade will not be possible after the UK leaves the single market and customs union.

In a speech aimed at supporters of “soft” Brexit, such as the chancellor Philip Hammond and the Labour Party, Mr Barnier said that he was uncertain whether the realities of leaving the EU had been fully understood across the Channel.

“I have heard some people in the UK argue that one can leave the single market and keep all of its benefits [but] that is not possible,” he told the EU’s economic and social committee, a consultative body of businessmen and trade unions.

The foreign secretary was the most senior minister to have broken ranks with official policy Reuters

Boris Johnson has been forced to concede that a government u-turn on public sector pay is unlikely in the near future in a major victory for Theresa May and Philip Hammond.

The foreign secretary was the most senior minister to have broken ranks with official policy and questioned the government’s continued commitment to the 1 per cent cap on pay rises.

However, this morning Mr Johnson stressed the need for the Treasury to be “fiscally sensible” in its approach to public sector pay.

His sudden about-face is a major coup for Mrs May, who along with Philip Hammond has come under intense pressure from senior ministers and the opposition over the future of the pay cap. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn yesterday accused the prime minister…

All new Volvo models will be hybrid or electric within the next two years VOLVO

The end of the internal combustion engine moved closer yesterday after a major carmaker became the first to abandon diesel and petrol-only vehicles.

Volvo, which sold almost 47,000 cars in the UK last year, said that all new models would be electric or hybrid within two years, adding that the age of the battery-powered car had arrived. Experts predicted that other mainstream manufacturers would follow suit.

Figures published by the motor industry showed that almost 59,000 new green cars were sold in the UK over the past 12 months, up 27.5 per cent in a year. Sales of petrol cars rose by 5.2 per cent while diesel sales fell almost 10 per cent year on year.

The decline of the combustion engine has been hastened…

Mr Trump gave a joint press conference with President Duda of Poland in which he threatened North Korea and criticised Russia’s “destabilising behaviour” Reuters

Donald Trump has raised the stakes in his showdown with North Korea this morning with a call for “all nations” to confront the regime — hours after Russia and China called for restraint.

Mr Trump, who is due to meet President Putin tomorrow, said that he was considering “some pretty severe things” to punish North Korea for its “very, very bad behaviour”.

He also raised the temperature by standing firmly with Poland against Russia’s “destabilising behaviour” and pledging that the US would help Europe to diversify its energy supplies.

Mr Trump gave his clearest statement that Russia interfered in the US election but tried to turn the focus on to his predecessor for not doing something about it.

He also continued his spat with US…

Boris Johnson told the Italian authorities that doctors and the judiciary should decide on treatment Hannah McKay/Reuters

Boris Johnson ruled out government intervention over Charlie Gard yesterday as the Vatican hospital offering to care for him said it was still working to bring the dying baby to Rome.

The foreign secretary told his Italian counterpart that doctors and the judiciary should decide on treatment for 11-month-old Charlie, as he and the prime minister were dragged into a controversy that has gone global after comments from President Trump and the Pope.

Lord Winston, the fertility specialist, was among experts criticising outside intervention on care for the baby, who has severe brain damage as a result of a rare genetic condition.

Charlie’s parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates, wanted to take him to the United States for an experimental treatment but a series of…

Andrea Sutcliffe, chief inspector of social care: “It appears to be increasingly difficult for some providers to deliver the safe, high quality and compassionate care people deserve” Chris Harris for The Times

One in three nursing homes is inadequate, condemning tens of thousands of elderly people to substandard care, an overview of inspections has found.

Elderly care is “precarious” with homes deteriorating as qualified staff leave over poor pay and conditions, inspectors say. Families face a “Russian roulette” with one in four social care services, including home care, not safe enough, campaigners warned.

Inspectors found residents going weeks without showers, falling repeatedly, missing medicines and being woken at dawn for the convenience of staff.

After inspecting all 24,000 social care services looking after a million people in the UK, the Care Quality Commission said the system risked tipping into disaster.

Andrea Sutcliffe, chief inspector of social care, said: “It appears to be increasingly difficult for some providers…

Relatives looking for a care home should walk round with the manager, take in the atmosphere and look for the sense that “it’s a community, not a service”, Andrea Sutcliffe , the chief inspector of social care advises.

Just 1 per cent of care homes are marked outstanding, amid acute problems with qualified staff, but Ms Sutcliffe insists the rating is possible with the right leadership.

At Attleborough Grange home in Nuneaton, inspectors recently found that “people and relatives were delighted with the kindness and thoughtfulness of staff, which exceeded their expectations of how they would be cared for and supported”. Staff, listened to what residents wanted, respected their choices and understood and shared the values of the home, the Care Quality Commission found. Problems…

Tony Blair was not “straight with the nation” when choosing to join the US, the head of the Iraq war inquiry said Stefan Rousseau/Getty Images

Tony Blair relied on emotional beliefs rather than facts in his decision to take Britain to war in Iraq, Sir John Chilcot has said.

The chairman of the seven-year inquiry into the legality of the conflict said that he believed Mr Blair was not “straight with the nation” when choosing to join the US coalition to remove Saddam Hussein from power.

In his first interview since he published his report, which concluded that the former prime minister had overstated the threat from Iraq, Sir John added that Mr Blair should not have committed himself to supporting the US before establishing the legal basis for war.

He told the BBC that Mr Blair’s dossier used to justify war was worded in a way that emphasised personal…

A new feature on Snapchat encourages its users to share their exact location with “friends” Getty Images

Schools and child protection experts have criticised Snapchat’s new “maps” feature, saying that it puts children at risk of grooming.

The feature, “snap map”, was introduced to the picture messaging app last month and allows users to share their exact location with people on their friends list in real time.

Teachers say that the map raised serious safeguarding concerns and could lead to children being tracked by paedophiles.

Rose Bray, of the NSPCC, said that parents should be given warnings before such features are launched.

Snapchat users are encouraged to browse a map of photos and videos that have been shared publicly and to share their location with “friends” in the app. Those who share their whereabouts appear as avatars on the map. However, many…

Top spots in the latest table have gone to boys’ grammars. Eton College was ranked 109th Christopher Furlong/Getty Images

Provincial grammar schools and a new breed of specialist free school have emerged as the unsung heroes of British education in an A-level league table that ranks schools on their science prowess. Top spots in the table have gone to boys’ grammars, including Reading School, King Edward VI Camp Hill School for Boys, in Birmingham, and Sutton Grammar, in Surrey.

Ilford County High School, a selective boys’ school in Essex, is one of the big climbers when evaluated on a Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) ranking. It comes 237th in the country when looking at overall A*-B performance but is at 17 when looking at performance in science subjects.

New free schools backed by universities to specialise in science are also serving their pupils…

A former chef who claimed he accidentally smothered a girlfriend in his sleep has been found guilty of killing two women after a campaign for justice by one of the victim’s families.

Robert Trigg, 52, told an inquest that he had rolled on to Susan Nicholson in 2011 as they slept on a sofa together, five years after he killed another partner, Caroline Devlin, 35, in her bed.

Both women’s deaths at their homes in Worthing, West Sussex, were recorded as non-suspicious despite his history of domestic abuse going back two decades. Trigg was brought to justice after Ms Nicholson’s family refused to believe his claim that he had accidentally suffocated her.

He was convicted yesterday after a ten-day trial of Ms Nicholson’s murder and…

Swim survival lessons in which toddlers and babies are dropped into water have been criticised by experts as “harmful” and “distressing”.

YouTube videos from the United States show toddlers being taught how to avoid drowning and critics say the children are distressed. Similar classes have arrived in Britain.

Emma Aspinall, 33, launched her own swim survival lessons after her son Loui, two, drowned in 2013 after wandering alone into a pool during a family holiday to Tunisia. She found a programme in America teaching children to “self-rescue” and raised more than £10,000…

The executors of Edward Albee’s will are being tested on whether they are afraid of defying the late playwright’s wishes.

The author of Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? stipulated before his death that his friends should destroy any incomplete manuscripts he left behind and included the instruction in a will filed in Long Island, where he lived.

The instruction from Albee, who died in September aged 88, could mean that his final known project, Laying an Egg, may never be staged. Although he circulated partial scripts, the final version was never completed.

It is not known whether the dramatist had been working on other projects that will also have to be destroyed.

CMO Insights and Analysis from Deloitte

Adding Value to the Franchise Model The traditional franchise model is evolving because of changing market and regulatory trends. CMOs at franchise businesses may benefit from using the franchise lifecycle model to provide marketing, operations, customer experience, and other types of support to franchisees throughout the course of the agreement.

Digital Tools a Boon to Small Business New Deloitte research indicates that small businesses can reap significant benefits from using digital tools. With small businesses representing a key engine for economic growth, job creation, and innovation, it will likely be important that they continue to seek opportunities to adopt new and more sophisticated digital tools and adapt them strategically to grow their businesses in the future.

Trends in the Mobility Ecosystem Trends such as computerized cars, ride-hailing, and autonomous vehicles will radically transform the future of personal mobility. Companies are beginning to consider the strategic implications of this increasingly complex mobility ecosystem, such as the opportunities and challenges posed by asset-light business models. What will industry leaders, including CMOs, encounter on the road ahead?

Organizing for Work in the Digital Age In response to digital disruption, companies are rethinking the way work gets done, shifting from traditional hierarchical structures to flatter, more flexible teams.
