CMO Insights and Analysis from Deloitte

Adding Value to the Franchise Model The traditional franchise model is evolving because of changing market and regulatory trends. CMOs at franchise businesses may benefit from using the franchise lifecycle model to provide marketing, operations, customer experience, and other types of support to franchisees throughout the course of the agreement.

Digital Tools a Boon to Small Business New Deloitte research indicates that small businesses can reap significant benefits from using digital tools. With small businesses representing a key engine for economic growth, job creation, and innovation, it will likely be important that they continue to seek opportunities to adopt new and more sophisticated digital tools and adapt them strategically to grow their businesses in the future.

Trends in the Mobility Ecosystem Trends such as computerized cars, ride-hailing, and autonomous vehicles will radically transform the future of personal mobility. Companies are beginning to consider the strategic implications of this increasingly complex mobility ecosystem, such as the opportunities and challenges posed by asset-light business models. What will industry leaders, including CMOs, encounter on the road ahead?

Organizing for Work in the Digital Age In response to digital disruption, companies are rethinking the way work gets done, shifting from traditional hierarchical structures to flatter, more flexible teams. To help their organizations become faster, more agile, and more adaptable, CMOs and other business leaders can adapt the way they approach talent, processes, and collaboration.

For the second time in two seasons, Chino Hill High School will be looking for a new head basketball coach. The school — which Lonzo, LiAngelo and LaMelo Ball have put on the map — has parted ways with their coach from this season, Stephan Gilling, according to the LA Times.

Gilling just finished his first season at the school, leading the Huskies to a 30-3 overall record after taking over for Steve Baik, who led the to a state championship in 2016. However, public sparring with LaVar Ball — the father of the Ball brothers — marred what was otherwise a successful season.

Gilling made national headlines a little over a month ago via an interview with USA Today, in which he described a confrontation with LaVar Ball in front of the team, which hampered chemistry going forward.

LaVar Ball responded to that accusation in an interview with Colin Cowherd on “The Herd” less than a week later [go to the 3:30 mark in the video above]:

“I’m not undermining [the program],” Ball told Cowherd. “That’s something that he said.

“He’s saying that because he’s sad now because he’s no longer in the [Ball] camp. He knew what he was getting into when he got the job. Who you think got him the job? How do you get to be a young, black coach for the No. 1 team in the nation? And you never had a freshman head coaching job?”

Ball later explained that not only did he train Gilling when he was younger, but that his wife helped him write the resume to get the head coaching job.

Regardless of the particulars, Chino Hills will be looking for a new head coach this summer.

LaMelo Ball still has two years left at the school, as middle brother LiAngelo gets set to go to UCLA and Lonzo prepares for the NBA Draft.

FOX Sports reached out to LaVar Ball for comment but he was unavailable.

Conor McGregor may be preparing for a boxing match with former pound-for-pound king Floyd Mayweather, but he hasn’t lost his passion for mixed martial arts.

The reigning UFC lightweight champion is already brushing up his boxing skills in anticipation that the fight with Mayweather will get inked with rumors attached to a fight date in September for the showdown between arguably the two biggest draws in combat sports history.

Just recently, McGregor took to Instagram where he showed off work with his head striking coach Owen Roddy while also pointing out that while he’s happy to fight under boxing rules for his next fight, he will never forget where he came from.

McGregor boasted about his boxing skills but also knows the pecking order in combat sports will always be commanded by mixed martial artists, who are capable of beating an opponent anywhere the fight might go.

“Myself and [Owen Roddy] have been working together on unrestricted, unarmed fighting, since we are kids. Not much will change when I fight under the famed, yet very limited, Queensberry rules (boxing rules),” McGregor wrote.

“No disrespect to single discipline fighters, from boxing to kicking to grappling, just know that understanding one style of fighting is simply not enough. You are lying to yourself. You are easily dismantled in a true fight. A fight with no rules to protect you. In a straight fight, you do not posses (sic) enough tools to keep you alive. You will be dismantled and killed.”

McGregor didn’t single out boxers or even mention Mayweather by name, but it’s not hard to read between the lines where the lightweight champion was focusing.

McGregor has never actually been involved in a pure boxing match but his confidence seems high as he continues to negotiation for a fight with Mayweather that could net the Irishman north of $75 million in earnings.

The latest post from McGregor ended with a quote from the late Bruce Lee, who seemed to echo his sentiments when discussing how to prepare for a real fight with no rules.

“Like the late, great Bruce Lee once said,” McGregor wrote. “When you are talking about fighting, as it is, with no rules, well then baby, you’d better train every part of your body”

The EU emerged as one of the principle architects of the Uruguay round of global trade liberalization completed in 1994, and since then, the EU has been a leading advocate for trade liberalization.

You & Mr Jones, the “brand tech” firm founded by former Havas CEO David Jones, is continuing its investment and hiring spree.

The New York-based company was launched in June 2015 with a $350 million investment to help it acquire and invest in companies that specialize in areas such as content creation, brand and content strategy, social-media marketing, data and analytics, programmatic media buying, and multichannel networks.

In the two years since it was founded, You & Mr Jones hasn’t slowed down on the deal front.

Recent, previously unannounced investments have included Tribe Dynamics, an influencer data platform that ties “earned media”—press coverage or other content placements that weren’t paid for by the advertiser—to sales. The firm also has backed Elsy, which uses artificial intelligence for media planning. Financial terms weren’t disclosed for either transaction.

The average strategic venture investment You & Mr Jones tends to make in a company—which previously has included the likes of digital media news and culture site Mashable and Pokémon Go maker Niantic—tends to be around $2 million. But it has invested anywhere from $100,000 to $6 million so far, according to Mr. Jones. On the majority acquisition side, total deal sizes, some of which are based on future performance, have reached from $30 million to just over $100 million.

Overall, You & Mr Jones has invested in 13 companies, acquired majority stakes in four firms and launched two of its own startups.

As for the future, Mr. Jones anticipates the company will be making more acquisitions in the data and analytics space, mobile video and “people-powered” marketing solutions that allow brands to tap into a crowd of talent to create their content. Mr. Jones expects the company also will make more minority investments in companies that work in the areas of augmented reality and virtual reality.

Mr. Jones said his company has four criteria it looks for in a potential investment or acquisition: “Is it a great business in a vertical we want to play in? Do we like the people? Will brands get excited about this? Can we do a deal at a valuation that makes sense?”

Ron Croen, partner at You & Mr Jones Photo: You & Mr Jones

Over the past year, the company has added a number of new partners to its team. Hires include Ron Croen, the founder and former CEO of technology company Nuance Communications; Julie Hardy, the former director at digital agency DAN Paris; and Amy Luca, who came on board in June as president of theAmplify, an influencer marketing platform You & Mr Jones acquired a majority stake in last year.

As a private company, Mr. Jones declined to provide financial information. But he did say that the company has more than $150 million of its initial investment left and that revenue grew 724% last year, albeit from a small, unspecified base.

You & Mr Jones has counted brands including Coca-Cola, Google, BNP Paribas, Facebook and Unilever among its clients.

While Mr. Jones comes from an ad agency background, he says he is “in no way, in any shape or form, looking to compete with or do what a WPP” does.

“Airbnb didn’t launch going, ‘We are going to launch a new Hyatt,” Mr. Jones said. “Uber didn’t go, ‘Yellow cabs, we are going to put them out of business.’ It’s a similar parallel. What we are setting out to do is create a new [brand tech] category.”

You & Mr Jones works with brands, but it has a couple of key differences from the way ad agencies work. The company doesn’t want to be on an agency roster and would rather be paid on a project-by-project basis, Mr. Jones said, adding that You & Mr Jones tends to find itself more in competition with management consultancies than ad agencies.

WWE Chief Brand Officer Stephanie McMahon and Paul Levesque, executive vice president of talent, live events and creative, speak at the 2017 Cannes Lions advertising festival. Photo: Cannes Lions

The sight of former World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. wrestler Paul Levesque, best known as “Triple H;” his wife Stephanie McMahon, who has notched up several stints in the ring herself; and their security entourage at the Cannes Lions advertising festival earlier in June turned some heads.

Unlike some of the celebrities invited to Cannes by ad agencies hoping to pull big crowds inside the sessions at Palais conference center, Mr. Levesque and Ms. McMahon were chiefly there to educate attendees about what WWE stands for. Mr. Levesque is now the entertainment company’s executive vice president of talent, live events and creative, and Ms. McMahon is WWE’s chief brand officer and the daughter of CEO Vince McMahon.

One of WWE’s key missions this year is to build its corporate brand. Ms. McMahon has been increasing her speaking engagements at business events, and Cannes was a vehicle to boost awareness about how and why brands should partner with the entertainment company through sponsorships and advertising.

“I think sometimes we still get stuck with people not knowing who we are and not knowing how to define us,” Mr. Levesque said, adding that people are often shocked by the company’s numbers.

WWE generated $729 million in revenue last year, up 11% from 2015. The company says it has more than 800 million social media followers and generated 12 billion views in the last 12 months on YouTube. WWE is the number one “sports” channel on the video platform, YouTube confirmed.

“Triple H” and Stephanie McMahon starring in WWE “Raw,” 2014.

Around two-thirds of WWE’s revenue is tied to TV rights fees, subscriptions and advertising, while the rest comes from selling live events tickets and products. In the U.S., WWE airs five hours of prime-time programming a week on NBCUniversal’s USA Network all year round, and that rights deal comes up for renewal in 2019. Its WWE Network, a Netflix-style streaming service for wrestling that costs $9.99 a month, had 1.95 million subscribers after its most recent WrestleMania event in April.

When WWE first launched its subscription streaming service in 2014, there were some concerns it could cannibalize its live TV audience.

But ratings remain relatively strong. In April 2017, for example “WWE Entertainment” and “WWE Smackdown” on the USA Network averaged over 3.5 million viewers either watching live or watching on-demand within seven days, according to Nielsen. That was up slightly from the 3.4 million viewers watching those programs in April 2016, according to Nielsen’s figures.

WWE’s executives will be hoping its performance in the ratings will help it gain leverage in the next round of rights negotiations. Brandon Ross, an analyst at BTIG Research, estimates NBCUniversal is paying around $150 million a year on average for WWE rights--“a fraction” of what top sporting leagues demand for their content on a per viewer hour basis. WWE declined to comment on that figure, and NBCU didn’t respond to a request for comment.

When WWE’s ratings deal comes up for renewal in 2019, “even if they got a 50% increase from where they are now, it would pale in comparison on a per eyeball basis to what other live sports can get,” Mr. Ross said.

cmo today newsletter Get your daily dose of media and advertising news with WSJ’s CMO Today newsletter. Sign up here.

WWE has several tiers for its content: linear TV, “originals” where it releases documentaries and reality shows like “Total Divas,” advertising-funded video-on-demand on platforms like YouTube, and its pay-per-view products. WWE created 1,500 hours of original content in 2016.

WWE says it has attracted around 50 “blue chip” sponsors over the past two years. Recent brand partners have included Mars, KFC, PepsiCo, Nestlé and Mattel.

Still, boosting WWE’s appeal to more advertisers may have its challenges, according to Mr. Ross. Although staged, its main events are still fights, and there is the perception WWE attracts “a lower income audience with less wallet than other programs,” according to Mr. Ross.

A WWE spokesman responded, saying: “The reality is that WWE has a massive, young, diverse and multigenerational audience that is proven to have significant spending power, reinforced by our blue chip advertisers and sponsors.”

The NXT developmental competition, which airs on the WWE Network, is a key area of growth for WWE. The company is also aiming to expand more internationally, particularly in China, where it launched a media partnership with PPTV last year, and in India, where Ms. McMahon says WWE is second only to cricket in terms of social media followers in the sports category.

“If you take all our platforms, all of the viewership, 70% of our viewership comes from outside the U.S., but only 30% of the revenue comes from outside the U.S.,” Mr. Levesque said. “It’s a huge opportunity.”

WWE has also made efforts to build the profile of women. At one time, women in wrestling were mostly there to be looked at and were called “Divas,” not “Superstars” like male wrestlers.

Things changed in 2015—a year that hosted a tag match between female wrestlers Brie and Nikki Bella vs. Emma and Paige that lasted just 30 seconds—when fans began demanding women’s wrestling be elevated to the main roster. The protest hashtag #givedivasachance trended world-wide for three days as fans called for more athleticism, enhanced characters and better story lines for female WWE athletes.

The following year, WWE rebranded its Divas division, announcing that all its performers would be known as “Superstars,” no matter which gender.

“It’s not just because we see it as this movement or thing to jump on,” Mr. Levesque said. “Any day of the week, I can go through our ratings numbers and the women will have the highest-rated segments of the night across the board.”

About 40% of WWE viewers are now women, thanks to the number of families that watch its shows.

That’s a key stat for marketers and could encourage more brands to partner with the entertainment company. WWE creates content that “appeals to both children and adults” that has to be compelling for both, “like a Disney movie,” Ms. McMahon said.

Good morning. A labor market at full strength, frothy asset prices, tightening central banks, and a pervasive sense of calm: all these make up preconditions for a recession. But, neither companies nor markets are preparing for this, therefore running the risk of being caught off-guard, writes Greg Ip.

Investors and businesses behave as if the current, benign conditions will last forever. That’s why even with muted economic growth, stocks are trading at a historically high 22 times the past year’s earnings. It’s also why home prices have returned to their pre-crisis peaks in major American cities.

Companies meanwhile have responded to slow, stable growth and low rates by borrowing heavily, often to buy back stock or pay dividends. Corporate debt as a share of economic output is at levels last seen just before the past two recessions. When everyone acts as if steady growth and low volatility will last forever, it guarantees they won’t.

Amid growing price pressures in China, Compagnie de Saint-Gobain SA, the French building materials manufacturer, has chosen to exit several product categories, instead of accepting lower margins, said Javier Gimeno, head of the company’s Asia-Pacific business.

Saint-Gobain no longer manufactures glass wool or architectural glass in China, Mr. Gimeno said in an interview with CFO Journal in Shanghai. “It is impossible to make money with these kinds of overcapacities,” he said.

Overcapacity among Chinese manufacturers have resulted in downward price pressures in these product categories, affecting margins.

Saint-Gobain now focuses on product classes it considers healthy, like plastics, automotive window shields and mortars.

“Making money here in China is much harder than in other Asian countries,” Mr. Gimeno said. “It is getting more complicated.” Nevertheless, the move — along with increased productivity has resulted in higher profit margins than in previous years, he said.

“My margins in China are better now than they were five years ago,” Mr. Gimeno said. Still, there is growing competition in the manufacturing sectors the company is now focused on.

Saint-Gobain targets operating profits in excess of 10% and wants its business in China to grow faster than the overall economy.

The Chinese economy grew by 6.7% in 2016, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The government’s target for 2017 is 6.5%.

Saint-Gobain employs around 10,000 people in China. The firm’s 35 plants generate annual revenues of EUR 1.3 billion ($1.47 billion), Mr. Gimeno said.

Stricter enforcement of environmental regulations by Chinese authorities helps to fend off Chinese competition, he said. “In the past, Chinese firms were not subject to the same kind of standards in relation to environmental protection and to safety at work,” Mr. Gimeno said.

“These regulations cost us [foreign firms like Saint-Gobain] a lot of money”, he said. Now, domestic competitors are held accountable according to the same set of standards, Mr. Gimeno said.

The country’s Premier, Li Keqiang, last week pledged to create equal conditions — a so-called level playing field — for foreign and domestic companies operating in China, a step welcomed by Western executives, including the chief executive of Johnson Controls International PLC, Alex Molinaroli.

“The laws are getting tighter, more aligned with Western standards,” Mr. Gimeno said.

Still, the outlook for Saint-Gobain’s China business is positive, he added.

Restrictions on the overseas export of capital, for example dividends generated in China, are no longer an issue, Mr. Gimeno said. Introduced late last year, the controls initially caused concerns among multinationals. “Capital transfers take a bit longer now, but that’s all”, Mr. Gimeno said.

Foreign firms that want to transfer money outside of China no longer have to ask for approval, and need to notify regulators ahead of the transaction, said Marcus Wassmuth, head of European corporate coverage at UniCredit S.p.A. in Shanghai.

Capital controls limiting the overseas M&A-activity by Chinese firms however still apply, resulting in high-profile deals, including the acquisition of Dick Clark Productions Inc. by Dalian Wanda Group Co., to stall. China’s banking regulator is conducting a sweeping check of the borrowings of big overseas Chinese deal makers, including Dalian Wanda, the Wall Street Journal reported in late June.

Payment processing has never seemed so cool.

On Wednesday, one payment processor offered $10 billion to buy a smaller one. The news that Vantiv was buying London-based Worldpay has investors suddenly thinking about other combinations.

Square shares rose 4% on Wednesday, while PayPal shares rose 3.3%.

For Square investors, consolidation in the payments industry is encouraging, because it means the fast growing company could also be thought of as an acquisition target.

PayPal is a much larger company than Square, with a market value of $66 billion, and it’s “less likely a target,” Mizuho analyst Thomas McCrohan tells Barron’s Next via email. But he notes that the stock benefitted today “as investors realize that the world is migrating to eCommerce.”

Vantiv operates in the U.S. and is popular with big-box retailers and grocers; Worldpay would give it international exposure and a big e-commerce presence. PayPal, of course, was a pioneer in online transactions and has doubled down on the business ever since separating from eBay in 2015.

Big Picture: Shares of PayPal and Square rose after payment-processor Vantiv made a $10 billion bid for Worldpay. The merger has investors wondering who could get bought next.

An analyst thinks it would make sense for the movie studios to consider in-home releases of new films, even if that cannibalized ticket sales. Illustration: Pixabay

Netflix has changed the way people watch TV. How much longer

As consumers increasingly get their entertainment fix from quality television shows offered by Netflix and others, movie studios might be wise to appeal to couch potatoes as well.

A new report from Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne argues that the big studios should get serious about premium on-demand video -- movies that would be available for digital viewing at the same time as (or shortly after) they appear in theaters. Such early-release movies could cost viewers $30 to $50 a pop, compared to the $5 to $7 you might pay nowadays to watch a movie months after its release.

Premium video on-demand “is not a new concept and has been experimented with for years,” Swinburne writes. “However, the desperation level in Hollywood is at new highs and a broader attempt at driving premium video on-demand seems almost inevitable.”

In a recent Morgan Stanley survey, about a quarter of respondents were “definitely” or “probably” interested in watching movies at home right after they come out in theaters. Swinburne notes that they tend to be the same people who already go to the movies often, but by his math, the movie studios would wind up with more revenue even if on-demand movies cannibalized ticket sales.

“Broad adoption of premium video on-demand could represent a shift in economic share from distributors to studios,” he writes, and could create $2 billion more in revenue for movie studios come 2020. Potential beneficiaries include the studio parents: Lionsgate, Time Warner, Viacom, 21st Century Fox, Disney, and Comcast. The movie-theater companies, or exhibitors, wouldn’t fare so well: Cinemark and Regal would be hurt if people could watch the latest blockbuster at home.

The couch-based screenings won’t be a simple click of the remote, though. It could take more time for the studios to make it happen. “The exhibitors oppose these changes, and there are contractual agreements between the studios and exhibitors that will likely have to be addressed for premium video on-demand to move forward,” Swinburne notes.

Tesla shares fell 4.9% Wednesday morning. Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

On Monday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to Twitter to celebrate the completion of the company’s first Model 3 production unit, which is expected to roll off the factory floor on Friday.

By Wednesday, the mood was not as celebratory, at least not on Wall Street. Tesla shares were down 4.9% Wednesday morning, to $335, as investors returned from their one-day July 4th break to digest somewhat disappointing news about the company’s second-quarter production. That data was dropped by Tesla on Monday afternoon, after most investors had already gone home for the Independence Day break.

Tesla said it delivered 22,000 vehicles in the second quarter: 12,000 Model S cars and 10,000 Model X SUVs. That wasn’t enough for some investors. Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne had been expecting 24,500 vehicles.

Musk hasn’t tweeted about the delivery figures, but in a press release, Tesla said second-quarter deliveries were affected by “a severe production shortfall of 100 kWh battery packs, which are made using new technologies on new production lines.”

Making electric vehicles is hard work, not least because of the complexities around batteries. “The technology challenge grows exponentially with energy density,” Tesla said in the press release.

The Wednesday selloff could be some investors coming to grips with those challenges. Tesla shares are up 57% so far this year, boosted by big expectations about Tesla’s Model 3. In a series of tweets Monday, Musk touted the coming production ramp, indicating the company could be producing 20,000 Model 3s a month by December.

But that’s no sure thing. “We continue to believe that the ramp seems aggressive and that the stock is overvalued,” Cowen’s Osborne wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, the latest production numbers have Goldman Sachs concerned about demand for Tesla’s existing car lines. “[W]e believe that Model S and Model X demand is plateauing in the 24k range per quarter,” Analyst David Tamberrino wrote on Wednesday. He rates Tesla shares at Sell.

Big Picture: It’s been a mixed week of news for Tesla. Its affordable Model 3 car is finally ready for delivery, but demand for the more expensive Model S and Model X may not be as strong as some hoped.

Oil prices rallied on Thursday, bouncing back from their worst loss in a month, after industry data showed U.S. stockpiles had fallen much more than expected last week.

Traders are now waiting to see if the official inventory report from the Energy Information Administration due later on Thursday will confirm the trend.

Crude oil for August delivery CLQ7, +1.60% jumped 63 cents, or 1.4%, to $45.76 a barrel, clawing back parts of the $1.94 loss from Wednesday. The contract settled 4.1% lower then, posting its first loss in nine sessions and its biggest dollar and percentage drop since June 7.

In London, Brent oil for September LCOU7, +1.53% rose 61 cents, or 1.3%, to $48.40 a barrel, partly recovering from Wednesday’s 3.7% loss.

The reversal on Thursday came after American Petroleum Institute late Wednesday reported a drop of 5.8 million barrels in U.S. crude supplies for the week ended June 30, easily beating forecasts of 2.8 million barrels.

The weekly oil report from the EIA is out at 10:30 a.m. Eastern on Thursday. Analysts polled by S&P Global Platts expect the EIA to report a decline of 1.6 million barrels in crude inventories.

“Attention is likely to be focused not only on inventory trends, but also on gasoline demand in the run-up to the fourth of July, as well as on U.S. oil production. The latter had decreased sharply in the previous week due to special factors, which makes a countermovement probable,” analysts at Commerzbank said in a note.

Read: Oil to rally 20% before year’s end — the case from a UBS analyst

Rising U.S. oil production in the wake of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries accord has been a major concern in the market and has kept a lid on prices in recent months. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a report on Thursday that if the OPEC cuts aren’t enough to balance the market, then U.S. shale production will need to slow down.

“To support prices in the mid-$50s, [OPEC] would probably need to lower production by another 200,000-300,000 barrels a day and extend the output agreement to end-2018. We find this unlikely,” they added.

Russia on Wednesday ruled out any further production cuts other than ones already agreed. OPEC and a group of non-cartel members—including Russia—in May extended a deal to cut production into the first quarter of 2018.

“For a chance of a balanced market in 2018, the U.S. rig count can no longer grow and possibly needs to contract ~150 rigs,” the analysts added.

The weekly Baker Hughes rig count last Friday showed a decline in active oil rigs for the first in 24 weeks. The number of rigs fell by two to 756.

In other energy products on Thursday, gasoline for August RBQ7, +1.37% rallied 1.5% to $1.52 a gallon, while gasoil for the same month rose 0.6% to $444.50 per metric ton.

August natural gas NGQ17, +1.06% climbed 1.3% to $2.88 per million British thermal units.

Shares of Tesla Inc. TSLA, -7.24% dropped 2.5% in premarket trade Thursday, extending the previous session's sharp selloff, after the electric car maker's Model S failed to receive a top safety award from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). After tumbling 7.2% on Wednesday, the stock was on track to open Thursday 17% below its June 23 record close of $383.45. The IIHS said the Model S didn't qualify for any award because it only earned an "acceptable" rating in the small overlap front test. "The main problem with the performance of the Model S was that the safety belt let the dummy's torso move too far forward, allowing the dummy's head to strike the steering wheel hard through the airbag," IIHS's report said. Although Tesla made changes to the safety belt in vehicles built after January, when IIHS tested the modified Model S, the same problem occurred. The cars that did receive "Top Safety Pick+" awards were Ford Motor Co.'s F, -2.25% Lincoln Continental, Daimler AG's DAI, -0.55% Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Toyota Motor Corp.'s TM, +2.36% Avalon. Other cars that failed to receive any award were General Motors Co.'s GM, -1.57% Chevrolet Impala and the Ford Taurus. Tesla's stock has rallied 53% year to date through Wednesday, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.15% has gained 8.7%.

Redfin Corp. is ready to test its online-offline business model, which combines modern technology with a corps of traditional real-estate agents, on Wall Street.

The Seattle-based Redfin RDFN, +0.00% has filed for a public offering raising up to $100 million, which is likely a placeholder sum, and has not yet specified the number of shares it plans to offer. The company has applied to list its common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “RDFN,” with Goldman Sachs GS, +0.33% and Allen & Co. listed as the lead underwriters on the offering.

Here are six things to know about the company — which enables home shoppers to browse online listings on the Redfin.com site and then book an agent to bring them to see desired properties — as it prepares to go public:

Growing revenue and paring losses

Redfin recorded revenue of $267 million in 2016, up from $187 million in 2015 and $125 million in 2014.

The company is still unprofitable but pared back its losses in 2016 to $22.5 million from $30.2 million in 2015 and $25 million in 2014. However, its net loss for the first three months of 2017, during which time Redfin started two new verticals, is $28.1 million.

Overall, the company has an accumulated deficit of $613.3 million.

Redfin is highly susceptible to economic conditions, including interest rates, credit markets and consumer confidence, which can make its business seasonal and cyclical.

The company is in 80 markets in the U.S., with the majority of revenue coming from metropolitan areas including Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and Seattle.

The online-offline model

Redfin combines an online model, in which consumers can browse homes and take virtual tours, and an offline model, in which real-estate agents whom the company employs meet with the home shoppers and take them to tour properties.

Redfin builds its own brokerage software and uses machine learning to recommend listings and answer users’ questions. The site also gives sellers advice on marketing their residences and uses its algorithms to calculate what the home is worth.

Competitor Zillow Group also combines its online model with offline agents, but it does not employ the agents directly.

Redfin says its process ends up cheaper for customers, as it rebates part of the sales commission when property purchases are closed, with an average of $3,500 per sale going back to a consumer. It also says it has a lower overall commission rate of 1% to 1.5% rather than the traditional 2.5% to 3%.

Redfin says it can afford to do this because it does not face high marketing costs to acquire customers, who come to the brokerage in the process of browsing online listings rather than via traditional advertising. (Marketing costs have been increasing, though, reaching $28.6 million in 2016, up from $19.9 million in 2015.)

The company said it had more than 20 million average monthly visitors to its website and mobile application in the first quarter of this year.

Cutting out the middleman

Redfin is trying to fill in other gaps in real estate and in the first quarter of 2017 it began originating and underwriting loans, with the intention of selling the debt on to third-party financial institutions, ultimately aiming to make the process of closing on a home entirely digital.

Also see: Mortgage rates swoon to 2017 low, but bond selloff threatens

This year it also started an “experimental” service in which the company buys homes from home sellers and then lists them on its site. So far that service may not be benefiting the sellers financially. “Customers who sell through Redfin Now will typically get less money for their home than they would listing their home with a real estate agent, but get that money faster with less risk and fuss,” the company said in its prospectus.

Neither business has had a material impact on Redfin’s operating results, but the company warns that it could invest more in these areas in the future.

Venture capital

The company has raised multiple rounds of private funding from venture-capital investors including Greylock Ventures, its biggest shareholder with a 12.4% stake before the offering, Madrona Ventures, whose pre-IPO stake is 11.4%, and Draper Fisher Jurvetson, which owns 10.2%.

It is not yet known whether the venture investors or company executives intend to sell shares in the offering.

In several rounds, Redfin has sold redeemable convertible preferred stock to its investors, receiving $167.5 million in return.

Only one data center

Redfin currently hosts its website at a single facility in Seattle, which means that its website and mobile applications could experience outages if anything were to happen in that area.

“Should this facility experience outages or downtimes for any reason ... we could suffer a significant interruption of our website and mobile application, which would harm our business,” the company says in its prospectus.

Geekwire has reported that Redfin appears to have recently switched to that facility, having previously run its operations on Amazon Web Services AMZN, +1.86% .

The problem with agents

Redfin counts its agents as employees, rather than independent contractors. These agents tend to earn less per transaction than traditional property agents, as the company tries to keep commissions low, which the company notes could cause it to struggle in attracting and retaining talent.

The company, though, has also encountered issues with the licensed third-party agents it uses when demand is particularly high or it does not have an agent in a given area. Redfin said it has entered into agreements to settle three lawsuits over class or representative claims from these agents and is awaiting court approval.

If you drew up a list of preconditions for recession, it would include the following: a labor market at full strength, frothy asset prices, tightening central banks, and a pervasive sense of calm.

In other words, it would look a lot like the present.

Those of us who have lived through economic mayhem before feel our muscle memory twitch at times like this. Consider the worrisome absence of worry. “Implied volatility”...

Conventional wisdom suggests you don’t need life insurance during retirement. By this point, the children are likely grown and financially self-sufficient and you’ve amassed a sizable enough nest egg to make life insurance superfluous.

Or so the thinking goes. But before you dump your policy, it pays to take stock of your financial situation and carefully consider your long-term goals. Only then will you know if you’ve got enough insurance, or too little or too much.

“Sometimes life insurance makes a ton of sense to keep and sometimes it makes no sense,” says Bob Gavlak, a certified financial planner and wealth adviser with Strategic Wealth Partners Ltd., a registered investment adviser in Independence, Ohio. “Sometimes it’s a matter of getting a more appropriate insurance strategy in place, given that your goals, objectives and financial circumstances have changed.”

Among the factors to consider: how much you’ve saved versus how much debt you’ve accrued; your financial obligations; your income-replacement needs; your health and how long you expect to live; your tax situation; potential liquidity issues; legacy-planning goals; and charitable-giving desires.

Ideally, financial advisers recommend that people evaluate their future insurance needs a few years before retirement, to optimize the timing of any changes they want to make.

Doing heirs a favor

Consider the case of heirs. Some people choose to keep life insurance during retirement because the death benefits are tax-free to heirs. Others maintain it as another asset they can use to balance out the distribution of their estate to their heirs. Life insurance can also give a surviving spouse a financial cushion, and provide a greater sense of financial security while both spouses are still alive.

Sometimes people with assets that are difficult to liquidate quickly, like property, maintain life insurance so their heirs have cash on hand to pay the expenses that can pile up when someone dies. Hans E. Scheil, a certified financial planner and chief executive of Cardinal Retirement Planning Inc., a registered investment adviser in Cary, N.C., typically recommends that clients purchase at least $25,000 in permanent life-insurance death benefits. This will help cover the costs of a funeral, probate and executor fees and provide some income replacement, he says.

“When a person dies, the survivors need some amount of money right away,” Mr. Scheil says. “You’ll be doing a real favor to your family. It’s as much convenience as it is necessity.”

Considering health

Health issues are another important consideration. Justin Halverson, founding partner at Great Waters Financial, an advisory firm based in Minneapolis, recently worked with a couple in their early 60s who had just retired. Each has a term life-insurance policy that will last well into their 80s. They don’t have long-term-care insurance and the husband wouldn’t qualify because of a pre-existing condition.

Mr. Halverson advised the couple to maintain their term insurance in case one of them needs nursing-home care and they deplete their nest egg to pay for it. The surviving spouse could then live comfortably on the insurance proceeds, he says.

Mr. Gavlak of Strategic Wealth Partners recently worked with a 61-year-old client who had a $350,000 universal life-insurance policy with a cash value of $100,000 and was planning to retire. The client no longer needed the death benefit to protect his wife and children, but he wanted to purchase long-term-care insurance. He used the cash value of the old policy to fund a new policy, in what’s known as a Section 1035 exchange, named after the section of the tax code that allows such transfers to be done tax-free.

Better alternatives

Sometimes, however, dumping life insurance makes more sense from a cost-benefit standpoint. Kimberly Foss, a certified financial planner and president of Empyrion Wealth Management, a registered investment adviser in Roseville, Calif., works with a 72-year-old widow who has a $500,000 whole life-insurance policy that she purchased 10 years ago after her husband died. Her goal is to leave that money to her grandchildren. However, she is paying tens of thousands of dollars in premiums each year. Ms. Foss advised her that she may be able to get a better return by investing what she is spending on premiums in a tax-deferred account and letting it grow over time.

Tony D’Amico, a certified financial planner who is the chief executive and senior adviser at Fidato Wealth, a registered investment adviser in Strongsville, Ohio, recommended a similar approach for two healthy and financially sound 63-year-olds he met earlier this year who had recently retired.

The couple has self-sufficient adult children and had amassed an investment portfolio of $1.5 million. Their term life-insurance policy was about to mature, and buying permanent insurance would have been prohibitively expensive, Mr. D’Amico says. The couple already had long-term care insurance, and he advised them to drop the term insurance and invest the money that they would have used to buy permanent life insurance.

Every decision about insurance requires meaningful financial planning, Mr. D’Amico says. “You make the most educated decision you can about your health and lifestyle and what you anticipate,” he says, “and then roll with the punches.”

“I could make a major time commitment to doing something purely for my pleasure” | Patricia Plumeri, who took guitar lessons and now plays in a four-person ensemble Photo: Patricia Plumeri

Like surprises? Retirement—for better and worse—will change your life more than you anticipate.

That’s the consensus of those who should know best: retirees themselves. Recently, as part of a discussion in these pages about changes in later life, we asked readers for help: Tell us what has surprised you in retirement. What did the experts neglect to mention? What would you tell would-be retirees to watch for?

The answer, in short: almost everything.

The surprises ran the gamut, from the wonderful to the devastating. Many readers told us they were surprised that their savings are holding up just fine, although several said that household expenses—and Medicare premiums, in particular—have been steeper than they anticipated.

Relationships? Conventional wisdom holds that making friends in later life is difficult, but numerous retirees told us the conventional wisdom is simply wrong. They also told us, however, that they miss being part of a team at work, much more than they imagined.

Fitness and health? Far from turning into couch potatoes, many readers told us they are in the best shape of their lives. “I feel better than I have in years,” says William Wilson, a doctor who lives in Atlanta and Portland, Ore., cycles daily and has lost 40 pounds since retiring in mid-2015. “I sleep well at night now, too. What a treat.”

Ask a Question Have a question about planning for and living in retirement? Email askencore@wsj.com

Most wrenching of all: stories of retirements cut unexpectedly short. “The biggest surprise has been mortality,” notes Richard Sandaas, a retired engineer and project manager, in Kirkland, Wash. “My wife took early retirement in 2003—and less than 10 years later passed away. We thought we had many years of postretirement ahead of us.”

What follows is a closer look at a number of these surprises. (You can read a sampling of the emails we received in full here.) On balance, at least from those who wrote to us, there has been more joy than pain, more satisfaction than frustration. Indeed, most readers told us they are surprised at just how much they are enjoying retirement—even if retirement isn’t always what they expected.

The Joys of Taking a Risk

Walking away from work, as with any major transition, can be overwhelming. After all, almost everything is changing: finances, daily routines, social networks. As such, some retirees are inclined to stick with the familiar, the activities and interests they know best.

But the biggest, and best, surprise in retirement, according to many readers, is what happens when you take risks. More to the point: Trying or learning something new, and risking your time and energy (and perhaps your pride) in the process, just might change your life.

Patricia Plumeri, age 69 and a retired accountant, has found a “second career” and “lifetime occupation” as, improbably, a guitar player in a four-person ensemble near her home in South Pasadena, Calif. The seed, she explains, was planted during her teenage years in southern England, where she grew up, watching fledgling bands—the Beatles, the Kinks, the Rolling Stones—perform in local music halls. A guitar, she recalls, “seemed to be an instrument that could really express feelings of joy and sadness.”

Six months after retiring in 2010—when “I could make a major time commitment [to] doing something purely for my pleasure”—she signed up for her first guitar lesson. Progress, she notes, was painful; hours of practice each week left her fingers numb. “I would go to my gym and swim in the pool, gently massaging my left hand to get feeling back into it.”

Today, her group (which includes her husband, also retired, on bass) plays two hours weekly. Performing in public, at least for the moment, isn’t part of the plan. But other rewards suffice.

“I wanted something in my life that wasn’t income-driven,” she notes. “The feeling of accomplishment—and the realization that I can actually play a guitar—is pretty heady stuff.”

Of course, change is difficult, and happy endings aren’t guaranteed. But reader after reader made the same point: Retirement is tailor-made for a leap in the dark.

“I thought of hobbies and other interests that I was ‘expected’ to do, but in the end did something totally different,” notes Bart Cormier, a retired engineer in Fernandina Beach, Fla. That “something” is volunteering full time with children’s programs, college students (as a mentor), senior home repair and his church.

Even “doing good” involves risks, Mr. Cormier notes. Tasks will come your way that, to your thinking, are a waste of your talents—or an affront to your dignity. Mr. Cormier, on more than one occasion, found himself “addressing waste-plumbing systems in homes that were a phone call away from being condemned.” There’s also a “risk of getting too committed and not being able to say ‘no,’ ” he adds. “The more you do, the more is wanted.”

Such hazards, though, tend to pale beside the payoffs, he notes. “There’s a deep satisfaction from knowing that you have changed someone else’s life for the better.”

Ah, Free Time at Last

“My surprise in retirement was discovering the unexpected luxury of time.”

That observation, from Vicki Robb, a retired real-estate agent in La Jolla, Calif., was echoed in dozens of the responses we received. Even though retirement today, as opposed to 20 or 30 years ago, is seen as more “active”—more “purpose-filled”—many readers told us that “active” isn’t mandatory. That it’s fine simply to…chill.

“Discovering the unexpected luxury of time” | Vicki Robb, who now has time for slow cooking and art classes Photo: Vicki Robb

Ms. Robb, for one, says there is now “time to take an extra moment to exchange pleasantries, and time to let someone in a hurry go ahead of you. (The hurried person used to be me.) Time to play with a child at their pace, and to meander when shopping, instead of power-walking to find the item and get ’er done. Time for slow cooking and to drive a friend to the airport. Time to ‘waste’ a morning at your first art class, even though you’ll never sell anything.”

A companion theme was the idea of “control”: retirees discovering that they are in charge of their daily routines—not their boss, their clients nor their children.

“The biggest surprise was realizing how much of our time when working was determined/dictated by someone or something else,” one couple told us. “In retirement, though, almost everything we do is because we decided to do it. It’s exhilarating.”

Brian McDonald, a retired pilot in Dillsburg, Pa., told us his days are filled with an eclectic mix of projects and chores: working in a small orchard on his property, shopping (“walking the aisles of deserted stores midmorning during the workweek is pure joy”), taking in the occasional movie matinee and, for good measure, building a small airplane. The point: He manages the schedule, rather than vice versa.

“I challenge myself daily with work of my own choosing,” he notes. “I get satisfaction from a well-built fence or a blemish-free restored piece of furniture.”

And the airplane? “The kit came with 10,000 rivets in a large cardboard box, so I use the level of remaining rivets as a thermometer of progress,” Mr. McDonald explains. “At last count, I have 9,000 to go.”

Careful Planning Pays Off

Financial surprises, not surprisingly, popped up in many of the responses we received. Frequently, a sigh of relief was audible: Nest eggs are working as planned. A number of readers noted that a healthy amount of self-discipline before retiring has a bigger impact afterward than most people realize.

“I’ve lived in the same house since 1972, keep cars for 10 years, exercise regularly for good health and, basically, live within my means,” says Rick Abell, a retired engineer who divides his time between Colorado and Ohio. If “you want to have a comfortable retirement, sacrifices are necessary while working.”

Interestingly, several readers pointed to the same factor as playing a critical role in their financial success: eliminating debt before leaving the workforce. (The Federal Reserve’s most recent survey of consumer finances found that, among older adult households with debt, median total debt increased to $40,900 in 2013 from $18,385 in 2001.)

“I was surprised how important it was to have no substantial debt,” notes Jonathan Stolz, a retired physician in Williamsburg, Va. “Having retired in 2004 without any money owed to the bank made riding out the stock market downturn and recession four years later easier to withstand. And I was able to sleep at night.”

Hit by High Costs

All that said, a number of readers complained about two disagreeable financial surprises: steep Medicare premiums and household expenses that were larger than anticipated.

With regard to Medicare, several readers said they simply didn’t realize how sizable and/or sudden changes in their income (example: taking a buyout) can make them vulnerable to Medicare “surcharges,” the larger-than-normal premiums that some individuals pay for Medicare Part B and prescription-drug coverage.

“The same change [in premiums] can result from the sale of stocks, bonds, etc.,” notes Elizabeth Gillette, a retired communications manager in Ossipee, N.H. “This was something we had never heard about.”

As for household budgets, some readers told us that one of the best-known rules of thumb in retirement planning—expect to spend about 80% of your preretirement income in retirement—is, well, hogwash.

“You will spend 100% of your preretirement income after you retire” | Steven Fechner, who spends more on travel and recreation, family events and medical Photo: Steven Fechner

“The big reality is that you will spend 100% of your preretirement income after you retire,” says Steven Fechner, a retired geologist in Reno, Nev. Yes, some expenses are lower, he allows, including commuting costs and clothing. But those savings, he adds, are “eaten up by costs associated with having more time.” Among them:

• Travel and recreation. “Instead of a yearly trip, now you take two or more.”

• Medical. “Instead of putting off medical tests because you didn’t have the time, you now try to figure out every ache and pain associated with aging.” And you often don’t have the same comprehensive insurance coverage you had through an employer.

• Family duties. As in: “Attending social events that you always had an excuse to avoid. Examples: weddings, funerals, baptisms, anniversary and birthday parties.”

• Vehicle maintenance. “The vehicles always seem to need something that you always ignored because you never had time to deal with it.”

The Pain of Mortality

For all the “good” surprises in retirement, several readers said would-be retirees should beware of unexpected jolts. The most devastating: the loss of a spouse.

Bill Sears, a retired contractor in Greenwood Village, Colo., lost his wife last year to Alzheimer’s. He had spent five years as her caregiver.

“Don’t wait until you retire to start enjoying life,” he cautions. “Appreciate that every day you’re as healthy as you’re ever likely to be.”

That sentiment was echoed by Mr. Sandaas in Washington, who lost his wife early in their retirement. The two had hoped to plant a vegetable garden in their yard and take cooking classes together to “get out of the rut of a revolving menu each evening,” he recalls. “But that didn’t happen.” And while they managed to travel extensively early in retirement, they had hoped for more.

“To those who might think there may be too much postretirement travel, I say: Don’t hold back,” Mr. Sandaas says. It “may not be possible in later years for a variety of reasons.”

Mr. Sears added that he is remarrying, much to his surprise. “It never occurred to me to think about marrying again,” he notes. But he credits his wife-to-be with “saving me from giving up.” The two have known each other since the 1960s.

“She and my wife had been friends all those years, so my wife is still part of our life,” Mr. Sears notes. “Her name comes up often and comfortably.”

And Mr. Sandaas, after his wife died, eventually bought an Airstream travel trailer and began crisscrossing the country, logging 20,000 miles in the past three years. “In addition to all the sights, the bonus is the interesting people along the way,” he notes.

Losing Yourself

Another warning from readers: Don’t be surprised if walking away from work is more painful than you anticipate.

“My biggest and most unanticipated retirement adjustment was my temporary loss of self-value,” says Kevin Blakely, a former banking executive in Carefree, Ariz. “Having burned both ends of the candle for 40 years, it was a shock to the system to suddenly find myself and my calendar no longer in demand.”

“My temporary loss of self-value” | Kevin Blakely, who found a part-time position that offered a mix of purpose and freedom Photo: Kevin Blakely

To deal with this, Mr. Blakely eventually took a part-time position with a consulting firm, a position that offered a mix of purpose and freedom. Bill Fenton, a retired doctor in Folsom, Calif., says he took a “slight self-esteem hit” when he walked away from medicine. His response, he says, has been to “redefine” what constitutes “work.”

“My former definition of work was to earn money to pay bills. My current definition is any activity that benefits me or society and [that] has a goal. After a little trial and error, I came up with exercising every morning as my ‘work,’ with the goals being to stay healthy and to reduce my time in the local sprint triathlon to under two hours.”

He has “no idea where this will end up, as things are still evolving, but my need to ‘work’ is fulfilled, [and] self-esteem is back to normal.”

The Ties That Bind

Finally, reader after reader told us that, despite concerns to the contrary, they are finding new friends in retirement.

“Maybe the biggest surprise was the change in my social life,” says Erika Lockhart, a former fire investigator in Albany, Calif. Her work typically had involved long hours, and, after retiring, “I was feeling isolated,” she recalls. Her solution: She organized two meetup groups—a walking group and a cooking group, both of which have been active for two to three years.

Today, “I have a better social life than I can recall ever having during my working years,” Ms. Lockhart says.

Readers said that retirement offers countless opportunities to meet people if you’re willing to be proactive: exercise classes, coffee-shop get-togethers, shared hobbies and interests (“getting my two dogs [in retirement] has been the best thing I have ever done; I have met so many wonderful people when I take the dogs for walks”), volunteer groups, nonprofits. The list goes on.

“How quickly and completely I left behind a 37-year career” | Bill Heitz, who cycles, golfs, volunteers and travels, among other things Photo: Bill Heitz

Bill Heitz, former chief executive officer of a design and construction management company, remembers vividly the day he retired. He walked out of his office in Atlanta and drove directly to a new home in South Carolina, where the moving van was waiting.

“What surprised me most about retirement was how quickly and completely I left behind a 37-year career,” he recalls. His days filled up immediately: golf and cycling with new neighbors, photography, woodworking, volunteering (with Score, a national organization of retirees who mentor entrepreneurs) and serving on his community’s board of directors.

“I learned the truth in what I had heard: Happiness in retirement is directly related to the people you spend time with,” he says. “What I found remarkable is that, in a community full of extremely successful retirees, very few talk about their careers. People here are focused on each other and in learning new skills and exploring new adventures. What a life!”

WSJ Wealth Expert Ted Beck of the National Endowment for Financial Education outlines four reasons why your employer may be reluctant to let you phase retirement--and how to counterpoint them. Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto

Ted Beck is president and CEO of the National Endowment for Financial Education, a member of the President’s Advisory Council on Financial Capability for Young Americans and chairman of the Jump$tart Coalition.

Retirement today isn’t as traditional as it used to be. As Baby boomers reach retirement age, more and more of us are opting to work longer–with three in 10 nonretired U.S. adults planning to work until age 66 or longer, according to a recent Gallup Poll. Many pre-retirees are looking for ways to ease into their second act. In fact, 42% of workers report that they want to retire gradually, according to a Transamerica study.

You Have a Donor-Advised Fund. Now What?

How Much Financial Knowledge Do People Acquire as They Age? Not Much.

The benefits to employees of cutting back hours before full retirement have been well documented, and include staying active, better health and, most importantly, not spending hard-earned savings.

But hold it: What happens when your employer isn’t keen on phased retirement as an option?

You had to sell yourself to get your job in the first place. Now, get ready to sell your phased retirement. Here are four reasons your employer may be reluctant–and counterpoints to bring to the negotiation.

1. You’re expensive. You won’t be able to deny that you may be expensive, even at half the time. So, if possible, volunteer for a reduction in salary beyond the automatic cut in pay you’ll have as a result of working fewer hours and/or benefits. Also, be sure to keep your new schedule under 1,000 hours annually, which often is the benchmark where paying for benefits becomes optional for your employer. Aim for a deal that works for everyone, and get it in writing. Once Medicare kicks in at age 65, you can transition from workplace health insurance.

2. They don’t want part-time workers. You want your employer to view phased retirement as a selective process, not a complete overhaul of company culture. How do you do this? Detail the efficiencies that you bring to the job. It’s assumed that older workers require less training and oversight. And, while younger workers might have more cutting-edge skills, they cannot compete with institutional and worldly knowledge.

3. They’re afraid you’ll never leave. Remember, you want flexibility, but your employer wants predictability. It’s important to set an end date and stick to it. Remind your employer that a new hire requires onboarding and training, and younger workers tend to change jobs more frequently. Your employer should weigh the risk of hiring a young person who could leave in two years against your solid commitment to a five-year phased retirement. Before presenting your proposal, devise a specific game plan for how you will train your replacement and how you will transfer your unique skills.

4. They think you’re old and outdated. Your employer doesn’t want to pay a part-time worker with retirement “senioritis” when they could pay less to an energetic upstart. But a staff comprised solely of recent college graduates might not be realistic, and will lack the balance of enthusiasm and experience. You need to make the case that your value is not just in your job skills, but in your network of contacts, both inside and outside of the company.

Imagine the rich conversations that could be had if older workers sat down with younger colleagues and said, “Here’s what I wish I would have known when planning for my own retirement.” Good luck building your bridge to 70.

Digital medicine—including remote monitoring and behavior modification—can improve outcomes in such costly and tough-to-manage categories as diabetes, heart disease and lung disease. Illustration: Anastasia Vasilakis for The Wall Street Journal

Technology is offering a new fix for one of the most confounding health-care challenges: getting patients with chronic disease to take better care of themselves.

About half of all adults suffer from one or more chronic diseases, which account for seven of 10 deaths and 86% of U.S. health-care costs. But preventing and treating such ailments requires time that doctors don’t have in brief office visits, and a degree of daily self-management that many patients have been unable to handle. They often become overwhelmed by the demands of their daily regimens, slip back into poor health habits, fail to take their medications correctly—and end up in the emergency room.

While there has been something of a national obsession with health apps like fitness trackers, most are aimed at exercise and lifestyle buffs and aren’t designed to link patients to health-care providers. There is generally no evidence to back their use in improving health outcomes for those who have chronic disease unless the patients’ own doctors are involved.

New studies, however, show that the emerging field of digital medicine—a combination of remote monitoring, behavior modification and personalized intervention overseen by the patients’ own doctors—can improve outcomes in some of the most costly and tough-to-manage categories such as diabetes, heart disease and lung disease. As a result, a growing number of hospitals and health systems are adopting digital programs that have been studied in clinical trials and can be delivered on a broad scale at low cost with the use of smartphones, wireless devices and sensors.

In addition to raising patients’ confidence that they can manage their health—and providing some hand-holding and nudging when they don’t—experts say the innovations allow doctors to gather data about patient behavior and symptoms, and intervene when patients aren’t following their regimens or have a flare-up in their disease. They also enable care teams to deliver continuing and consistent support to change behavior, such as losing weight, taking medications as prescribed and exercising. “Digital medicine allows us to get into your life in a personal way, deliver interventions continuously and inspire you to be healthy in a way an office-based practice can’t,” says Joseph Kvedar, a physician and researcher who is vice president, connected health, at Partners HealthCare, which includes Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

Partners has tested such approaches as remote blood-pressure monitoring for hypertension patients, text messaging to motivate diabetes patients to exercise daily, and remotely monitored electronic pillboxes that alert congestive-heart-failure patients to take their medications. Such technology, if widely adopted, could deliver behavioral interventions to whole populations and engage patients in ways that were unimaginable in the past, Dr. Kvedar says.

The push for digital medicine comes as reimbursement for medical care is shifting from fee-for-service arrangements to a focus on delivering quality outcomes at reasonable cost. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services currently covers some telehealth services, such as seeing a doctor over a video connection, and is now contemplating changes that might cover the use of digital services such as apps as well. The explosion in digital medicine has spurred researchers to develop apps for studies of diabetes, asthma and heart disease, and myriad technology startups are pitching disease-management apps to health-care providers.

But Amir Lerman, an interventional cardiologist and professor of Medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., cautions, “You can’t just build an app in your garage and think it is going to change medical care. You need to have a treatment plan behind it, and a health system to care for the patient.”

That, in turn, has spurred the health-care industry to study which technologies are best. Two dozen health systems including Rush University Medical Center in Chicago and the University of Virginia Health System have joined a network run by Avia, a company that helps vet and test digital approaches to patient care. And the American Medical Association recently announced a collaboration called Xcertia with the American Heart Association, the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society and others, which is developing guidelines for evaluating mobile health applications. “Physicians recognize the tremendous potential in digital health tools,” says James Madara, the American Medical Association’s chief executive, “but without a framework to evaluate them, there could actually be harmful effects.”

“We have to figure out how to prioritize these thousands of ideas that come at us every week,” says Mike Dandorph, president of Rush. “When we try innovative ideas, we must ask, does it advance outcomes, provide a good patient experience and change the overall cost of care?”

Here are some approaches backed by evidence that are gaining traction in digital medicine.

Diabetes: Keeping the condition at bay

Prediabetes—higher-than-normal blood sugar—increases the risk of stroke and heart attack. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, prediabetes affects 86 million adults, or more than one in three, and as many as 30% of them will develop diabetes within five years unless they lose weight through a healthy diet and exercise.

While many health plans and insurers offer diabetes-prevention plans, the lifestyle changes to ward off diabetes can require daily hand-holding, so more are looking for ways to deliver such programs digitally. In collaboration with the American Medical Association, Salt Lake City-based Intermountain Healthcare, with 22 hospitals and 185 clinics, is pilot-testing an online program provided by San Francisco-based Omada Health for patients at risk for diabetes. The yearlong program starts with a core 16-week online course on better lifestyle habits, and assigns patients to a personal health coach and private online support forum with moderated discussions.

Participants receive a pedometer and a cellular scale that transmits their weight readings to their Omada profile, and are visible to the coach. They log their daily activity and food either online or with a mobile app; if they have a connected device such as an Apple Watch, they can link it with the program to transmit activity automatically. Their results are displayed on a personal dashboard. After the initial sessions, Omada provides a 36-week sustaining curriculum focusing on weight maintenance. “You can’t just send someone a scale and a step tracker and pray for results,” says Omada Chief Executive Sean Duffy. “You have to combine these instruments with high-touch intervention” that includes social support and personalization.

Coaches usually reach out once or twice a week to check on whether participants have completed their lesson, answer questions and congratulate the patient on tracking activity or meals. Patients can also communicate as often as they like with coaches, who are required to respond within a day of any outreach. Omada sends Intermountain aggregate patient reports to show how an overall population is doing, but can also send individual patient reports for follow-up. Coaches can also encourage patients struggling in the program to reach out to their Intermountain doctors.

Research has shown that Omada participants are able to maintain weight loss and lower average blood-sugar levels two years after starting. In one study of 501 Humana Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, published in the Journal of Aging and Health, participants lost 7.5% of their initial weight after 12 months, improved blood-sugar levels, and lowered cholesterol. In addition to reducing their risk of diabetes, participants also reported improvements in self-care, diet and exercise, and lower feelings of depression and isolation.

“The new reality is that patients want to seek care in their own environment and on their own schedule online, as opposed to going to the office and waiting for a provider,” says Mark Greenwood, an Intermountain physician and one of the initiative’s program leads. “The future of primary care is to be both physician and navigator, hooking up patients with technology to help them manage their conditions.”

Omada estimates health plans and insurers it contracts with recoup their investment in the program within two years, with a predicted net savings of more than $2,000 per participant over five years. Dr. Greenwood says payment for the program will be based on outcomes. But he also says savings will come from preventing progression to full-blown diabetes, which can cost $8,000 a year to manage per patient.

One Intermountain participant, Michael Astle, 64, enrolled after he learned his blood sugar was in the high range. “I knew that my health was at risk, and I wanted to lose weight,” he says, but he kept putting off doing anything about it. He liked using the cellular scale to track his weight and the app on his phone to record activity and diet, and though he never met the other online participants, he says the forum helped “form a bond if someone was struggling or feeling bad and needed encouragement.”

Within 16 weeks he was down to 190 pounds from 227, and continues to lose weight toward his goal of 180. Mr. Astle says it is motivating to know that every time he steps off the scale, it sends his weight to his coach, “and I can’t let it go back up.”

Pulmonary disease: Holding back the symptoms

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, affects an estimated 30 million Americans and encompasses emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Commonly associated with smoking, it causes increasing difficulty with breathing, and exacerbations can lead to repeated trips to the ER and hospitalizations if not treated in a timely manner with medication. Patients may fail to recognize that symptoms are getting into the danger zone, leading to delays in treatment.

Temple University’s Temple Lung Center in Philadelphia has developed a health application called COPD Co-Pilot. Once daily, patients use a smartphone to report symptoms including breathlessness, cough, wheeze and sore throat on eight easy-to-read screens, and use hand-held meters to measure the air flowing in and out of their lungs. Those who don’t report in by noon get a reminder from the system.

A computer algorithm helps measure how serious the symptoms are compared with the patient’s baseline data; nurses review the scores and refer patients who appear to need immediate treatment to doctors who can prescribe same-day therapy. There are different treatment plans for less urgent scenarios, which nurses can recommend after review with a doctor, and communicate via text or email back to patients who can respond that they will comply or that they may need something else.

A 2015 study in the journal Telemedicine and e-Health found that patients who used the app to report daily symptoms and received same-day treatment experienced fewer and less severe exacerbation symptoms, leading to improved symptom control, lung function and activity status.

“By linking the provider directly to the patient, we can get therapy to them sooner rather than later and prevent things from getting worse,” says Gerard Criner, director of the Temple Lung Center and principal investigator on the study. (The technology used in the study has been adapted by a Temple spinoff company, HGE Health Care Solutions, founded by Dr. Criner.)

Ronny Neal, 58, a Temple COPD patient, has been using the app for about a year. His condition sometimes makes it difficult to walk or breathe and once landed him in the hospital for several days. Mr. Neal was skeptical at first, when his team at Temple suggested the program, wondering, “Are they going to follow me every step I take?”

But he says it has helped motivate him to stay on top of his symptoms much better than in the past, and get attention and medication quickly when they get worse. On the few occasions he forgets to enter his information, he gets a text nudging him to check in. “It’s a tough disease with no cure, but you don’t want it to get any worse and you don’t want to be going in and out of the hospital,” he says. “It’s now part of my routine—get up, brush my teeth, take my medicine and check in.”

Dr. Criner says the program aims to help patients better control their COPD, while staying connected to the Temple Lung Center team on a daily basis.

Blood pressure: Monitoring medicine

Patients too often fail to take their medications as prescribed, a particularly dangerous problem for chronic-disease patients. One study showed that new prescriptions for diabetes, high cholesterol and hypertension, known as high blood pressure, weren’t even filled 22% of the time. Because high blood pressure and high cholesterol don’t have apparent symptoms, patients may skip doses or figure they don’t really need the drugs.

To improve patients’ compliance with blood-pressure medication, Rush University Medical Center is working with Proteus Digital Health, of Redwood City, Calif., to prescribe its Proteus Discover system, which encapsulates medications in a single pill with an ingestible sensor the size of a grain of sand, made of trace amounts of minerals. Once swallowed by a patient, the sensor communicates with a wearable patch worn on the torso, which records the time the medication was taken as well as data such as heart rate, steps and rest.

The patch transmits the information wirelessly to an app on a mobile device, such as a smartphone or iPad, for the patient to monitor and share with a health-care provider, and sends an alert if a dose is missed. If the patient forgets to take a pill, they can be alerted by a notification to their mobile device.

A study published last year in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that the use of Proteus Discover led to greater reductions in blood pressure and cholesterol in patients with uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes than usual care.

“We know there is a mismatch between the prescriptions we write and the prescriptions that get taken by patients,” says Anthony Perry, vice president for population health and ambulatory services at Rush. “This is a tool that provides data back to the patients and provides a feedback loop to help build strong habits that support taking medications consistently.”

Heart disease: Helping patients take charge

Heart disease causes one-third of deaths in the U.S., but many of them are due to preventable risk factors like poor diet, smoking and lack of exercise. After angioplasty, a procedure to reopen coronary arteries following a heart attack, patients can avoid a repeat event by undergoing a cardiac rehabilitation program. But patients may not do all the follow-up necessary, and programs are often limited in the personal attention and time patients get from rehab teams.

In a study at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minn., published earlier this year in the journal Clinical Investigations, researchers tested a health program available online or through a smartphone app that provided information about healthy lifestyles and asked patients undergoing cardiac rehab to report dietary and exercise habits. Compared with a group of patients that had usual care, those using the digital program lost more weight and improved lifestyle habits and had fewer cardio-related ER visits and rehospitalizations.

Steve Ommen, a cardiologist at Mayo and medical director of its Center for Connected Care, says Mayo is incorporating apps, wearable monitoring devices and other digital technology into programs for patients with chronic diseases.

Mayo’s aim, Dr. Ommen says, is not to find an app for each disease, but to find solutions that can be broadly used in managing all complex diseases, particularly since so many patients are struggling with multiple conditions. Ideally, he says, patients could have a period of intense monitoring to get them on the right track and then “graduate to self-care and self-monitoring.”

“Whenever we introduce a new technology to help them, patients are very open to trying it,” he says. “This will definitely change the relationship between patients and care teams, but we see it as being more connected and really extending and enhancing our relationship.”

For auto giants, the new ownership models—whether for traditional cars or self-driving ones—constitute a major threat. Illustration: R. Kikuo Johnson for The Wall Street Journal

Cars are going to undergo a lot of changes in the coming years.

One of the biggest: You probably won’t own one.

Thanks to ride sharing and the looming introduction of self-driving vehicles, the entire model of car ownership is being upended—and very soon may not look anything like it has for the past century.

Drivers, for instance, may no longer be drivers, relying instead on hailing a driverless car on demand, and if they do decide to buy, they will likely share the vehicle—by renting it out to other people when it isn’t in use.

Auto makers, meanwhile, already are looking for ways to sustain their business as fewer people make a long-term commitment to a car.

And startups will spring up to develop services that this new ownership model demands—perhaps even create whole new industries around self-driving cars and ride sharing.

Here’s a look at the changes to come, and what they mean.

Drivers: No more permanent arrangements

Car ownership, for a long time, has symbolized freedom and independence. But in the future, it may be akin to owning a horse today—a rare luxury.

Ride sharing as we know it will grow in popularity as people get even more comfortable with the sharing economy, and more people migrate to dense cities where owning a car is a burden. One-quarter of miles driven in the U.S. may be through shared, self-driving vehicles by 2030, according to an estimate by Boston Consulting Group.

And the business of ride sharing may take on some new forms.

Startups such as Los Angeles-based Faraday Future envision selling subscriptions to a vehicle—for instance, allowing people to use it for a certain number of hours a day, on a regular schedule for a fixed price. So, people who need a vehicle for a few hours daily to attend meetings or make deliveries could subscribe and avoid having to summon on-demand rides every day (and potentially paying a lot more).

Other companies are experimenting with the idea of allowing drivers to access more than just one kind of vehicle through a subscription—so, a driver might choose a compact model one day but a minivan another day if she needed more passenger space.

“By 2022, 2023, the majority of transportation in urban cities with temperate weather will be on demand, shared and likely autonomous,” says Aarjav Trivedi, chief executive of Ridecell, a San Francisco company that provides the back-end software for car sharing.

Even people who do end up buying a car may come to see it as a short-term arrangement—and a source of income.

Chief Executive Elon Musk has hinted that he’s preparing to create a network of Tesla owners that could rent out their self-driving cars to make money. Already, some drivers are testing this idea using other services that let them market their cars, something like Airbnb rentals on wheels.

Take Jeff Cohen, who works for an electric-vehicle-charging company. His wife balked at his desire to buy the Model S sedan, which Tesla Inc. typically sells for about $100,000.

He persuaded her to allow him to buy a Tesla if he would in turn rent it out on a site called Turo. Doing so—at $189 a day—almost covered the cost of the entire monthly loan payment while giving him the ability to drive the electric car around Atlanta when not in service, he says. “It allowed me to get the car,” says Mr. Cohen, 58 years old. “We weren’t in agreement that we could get a car like this without some way to fund it.”

Turo, which had more than three million people sign up for the service through the end of May, says Teslas, along with BMW and Mercedes-Benz cars are among the more popular searched vehicles on the site.

“A lot of people are realizing that the car is no longer just a cost—it’s an asset,” says Andre Haddad, Turo’s chief executive.

Of course, the biggest obstacle to many of the changes may be the most simple: People have to be willing to give up the idea of owning their car—something that has been culturally ingrained over many decades.

What’s more, under this vision, car buyers won’t just give up the idea of sole ownership. They may also give up the idea of sitting behind the wheel by using autonomous vehicles.

They will have a powerful incentive to do so. A study by Deloitte Consulting, for example, estimates that the cost of personal car ownership is on average 97 cents a mile today but could drop by two-thirds in a world of shared, self-driving vehicles—a tipping point that could usher the technology into daily life for many people. In cities, the idea will be even more appealing, because it takes away the unpleasant sides of ownership, such as parking and negotiating traffic jams.

Companies are already looking at how to market vehicles to overcome some of the possible psychological resistance to nonownership. Waymo, the self-driving tech unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc., has begun public trials of self-driving minivans in Phoenix for select users, with the eventual goal of testing them with hundreds of families.

The goal is a better understanding how to make such a service appealing enough to take the place of a family car.

“We’re really experimenting here with how far our users can go in terms of using a service like this one to replace their own personal transportation,” says John Krafcik, head of Waymo and a former automotive-industry executive.

Big auto makers: Making peace with on-demand services

For auto giants, the new ownership models—whether for traditional cars or self-driving ones—constitute a major threat.

As a result of both driverless cars and fleets of robot taxis, sales of conventionally purchased automobiles may likely drop. What’s more, because autonomous cars will likely be designed to be on the road longer with easily upgradable or replaceable parts, the results could be devastating to auto makers that have built businesses around two-car households buying new vehicles regularly. Currently, cars get replaced every 60 months on average, according to Experian.

“It may become more like the airline business where we see jets that have been in service for 50 years,” says Chris Ballinger, chief financial officer and head of mobility services at the Toyota Research Institute. “Now I don’t think a car will be in service for 50 years but I’m saying it may move in that direction…with tens of millions of miles and decades of service.”

In response, some car companies are trying to meet that threat head-on, by experimenting with different ownership models.

One plan to get drivers to buy a vehicle of their own is to help owners rent out their vehicles, as they would in Mr. Musk’s planned network of Tesla owners. Toyota’s Lexus brand is testing payment plans that let people subsidize the purchase of pricey cars by renting them through a service called Getaround. The hope is that young buyers, who have been eschewing traditional ownership but are still attracted to luxury nameplates, will grab the chance to afford fancy cars on Corolla budgets.

BMW , meanwhile, is experimenting with shared rides through its Reachnow service. Members can get access to a fleet of BMW vehicles—and Minis, in some areas—that they pick up as needed and can drop off anywhere when they’re done.

General Motors Co. , the largest U.S. auto maker by sales, seems to be hedging all bets. The company acquired an autonomous-car tech startup called Cruise Automation last year in a deal with a potential value of more than $1 billion. It also invested $500 million in ride-share company Lyft, as well as starting a car-sharing service of its own called Maven.

Meanwhile, it’s offering Cadillac customers the ability to subscribe to ownership, letting them use a vehicle for a month at a flat fee.

New businesses: Helping to power a new industry

The advent of self-driving cars will give people more free time while in the vehicle. And that will create new opportunities for car makers and others to make money.

Autonomous vehicles could ultimately free up more than 250 million hours of consumers’ commuting time a year, unlocking a new so-called passenger economy, according to Intel Corp. , which is trying to provide the computing power behind self-driving software.

The chip maker released a study in June that estimates as much as $800 billion could be generated by 2035 by this passenger economy, while as much as $7 trillion could be in play by 2050.

All of which might explain why new entrants to transportation, such as Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. , are exploring the field. Apple in April, for example, became licensed to test-drive autonomous vehicles on California roadways.

This could lead to a turn away from using the exterior of the vehicle as a selling point and focusing on making the interior as comfortable and loaded with features as possible.

In some cases, that means turning cars into living rooms on wheels: Harman International Industries Inc., the auto-parts supplier acquired by Samsung for $8 billion, demonstrated in Las Vegas earlier this year a vision of a car that replaces a vehicle’s windows with video screens that create a wraparound movie theater inside the cabin.

Design firms will also cook up features designed to ease people into the practice of sharing rides regularly. IDEO, the design firm that came up with Apple’s first computer mouse, has released a vision of autonomous vehicles designed to accommodate strangers who end up riding together.

One central feature is “pods”—seats that can be adjusted to block a passenger from the view of the others—and there are areas in the vehicle that allow them to lock items while other people use the car.

Other companies are working on ways to make cars recognize passengers’ digital profiles and become more responsive to their needs. That might involve things such as reminding someone that a calendar appointment is coming up, and nudging them to leave earlier that day, or giving advice on places to eat along their route or ways to shop online while in traffic.

Zoox, a startup valued at more than $1.5 billion, is working on designing a robot taxi that takes the entire riding experience into consideration, co-founder Timothy Kentley-Klay said last year.

Although he didn’t go into details on the so-called mobility service’s features, Mr. Kentley-Klay said that such a vehicle would be “smart enough to understand its environment, but importantly, it’s also smart enough to understand you, where you need to be, what you want to do in the vehicle and how you want to move around the city.”

Existing industries may change to support an autonomous, shared future. For instance, the alcohol industry might see a rise in drinks consumed weekly with customers not having to worry about driving home, says a Morgan Stanley report by analyst Adam Jonas. He estimates the $1.5 trillion annual market might expand by $250 billion due to autonomous vehicles.

One industry that knows cars very well—dealerships—may also adjust to fit the changing times: Managing autonomous car fleets may be a new line of business. Toyota’s Mr. Ballinger noted that auto makers’ finance arms largely finance local franchise dealers’ inventories, called floor plans.

“It may be a variation of that model where we continue to finance the floor plan, only the floor plan now isn’t an inventory of cars ready for sale but an inventory of cars going around providing services—maintained and managed by the dealer or somebody like the dealer,” Mr. Ballinger says.

For all the speculation about big changes on the way, and plans to meet those changes, it’s important to remember that drivers may want to hang onto some form of ownership even if others are more convenient and cost-effective.

Mr. Cohen, after spending about two years renting out his Model S on Turo, has begun to wind down that effort.

“At almost exactly the second anniversary of that note, I paid off my Tesla,” he says. He’s keeping an eye on Tesla’s ambitions for renting out autonomous vehicles, though he is dubious about giving up the thrill of driving. “For me, autonomous driving is not something I am looking forward to,” he said, “but I can tell you that my 25-year-old son and recent UVA Law School graduate certainly is.”

Wilbur Ross talks about reducing U.S. trade deficits and renegotiating better trade terms instead of pulling out of international trade agreements.

One of the most notable political trends over the past 18 months—and one with the potential to affect companies across many industries—has been voter pushback against globalization and free trade.

Indeed, following the Brexit vote in the U.K. and Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election, nations are rethinking how they should trade with each other

At the forefront of this debate in the U.S. is Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. He sat down with The Wall Street Journal’s financial editor, Dennis K. Berman, to discuss how the Trump administration views trade relations with China and the rest of the world. Edited excerpts follow.

Sensible give-and-take

MR. BERMAN: At his inauguration, President Trump said: “The rule of the future should be to hire American and buy American.” What is the moral duty of the CFOs here to abide by that rule?

MR. ROSS: Just about every other country in the world has more protectionist rules than we do. Take China. China has the most beautiful free-trade rhetoric. And those of you who do business either within the country or try to export to it know they are the most highly protectionist of the big countries. So this is nothing new. We’ve been in a trade war for decades. The only difference is now the American troops are coming to the ramparts for maybe the first time.

MR. BERMAN: But for goods that have been brought into the U.S. and are legitimately cheaper, do CFOs have a duty to buy American?

MR. ROSS: Well, the “Buy American” policy relates to federal contracting. It relates to pipelines. It relates to some pretty specific activities.

But I think people ought to think about short term versus long term. If I were an importer, I would beware of what happened already in the rare-earths [metals industry]. China is a very big supplier of rare earths, which are quite essential to many electronic products. They drove everybody in this country out of business by dumping, dumping, dumping, dumping. And guess what happened once they did? Prices suddenly went way up. And when they get angry with a country, they cut off the supplies.

So long term, it seems to me, the interests of American businesses and of the president’s policy are totally consistent because there are no free lunches.

MR. BERMAN: How bad is it with China in terms of our ability to access the Chinese markets and the way they behave in the U.S.?

MR. ROSS: Well, we’re making a lot of progress with China. The Mar-a-Lago summit, which I was privileged to be part of, accomplished a lot, and mostly all to the good. I’ll give you some examples.

For 14 years, American beef producers have been trying to get their product into China on an unfettered basis. In less than 100 days, we got it in. And that first beef will literally be leaving in about 10 days. The same is true for some other things.

Those were the easier deliverables. We’re now working on another list. We generally have two conference calls a day, one early in the morning our time and one late at night with the Chinese. That’s five, six, seven days a week.

The whole fabric of these discussions is different from prior ones. We aren’t interested in great long-winded debates and big ceremonial meetings and big proclamations that have no teeth. We’re interested in very specific, very tangible achievements. And we’re finding a very, very sensible give-and-take with the Chinese right now.

An obsolete agreement

MR. BERMAN: President Trump said on the campaign trail, he wanted to get out of the WTO. Is that going to happen?

MR. ROSS: That’s a very radical step for one to take. I do think there are things that need to be fixed in the WTO, but I think our first effort should be internal reform, not blow up the whole system.

MR. BERMAN: Let’s talk about Nafta. If there is one most important thing about changing the dynamic in Nafta, what is it?

MR. ROSS: Well, it’s an obsolete agreement. It didn’t envision the digital economy at all. Barely talked about natural resources. Barely talked about service, particularly financial services. It didn’t really address our economy or theirs the way they are today.

And some of its manufacturing provisions are totally obsolete. In automotive, they put in a procedure which in concept is a good one, called rules of origin. Namely, what percentage of the content of a finished product can come from outside Nafta and yet get the favorable tariff treatment as though it were all 100% from within Nafta?

The problem is, automotive technology has moved on. Half those parts aren’t even used in cars anymore.

MR. BERMAN: But how do you [change Nafta] without pissing everyone off?

MR. ROSS: We solved the sugar thing without pissing everyone off. We’re trying to solve some of the little disputes with Canada. Disputes are resolvable if people are of reasonable will and are willing to make reasonable compromises. We made some big changes with China. I don’t see them suddenly screaming and yelling.

MR. BERMAN: President Trump famously mentioned American “carnage” in his inauguration speech. What did he mean by that and what is going on in America that you need to pursue this policy?

MR. ROSS: We’re pursuing the policy because we think it’s the correct policy. Does anyone think that China would have been able to transform itself from a very, very poor, basically rural society to the second-biggest power in the world without a favorable trade balance? The question I would pose to those who say deficits don’t matter is: “If trade surpluses do matter, is it really possible that trade deficits don’t matter?” And especially when there are ways to cure them.

To the countries with whom we have the big deficits, like China, we are going to say: “Look, there are a bunch of products that you buy, some from us and some from other people. We’re your largest customer. You really ought to give us a little better market share. It isn’t going to hurt you to buy cattle from us instead of from X country or soybeans from us or industrial goods from us.” So substitution of, or changing market share, would be one easy way to redistribute a bit of the deficit.

Because it isn’t inherent in free trade, in my view, that one country, namely the U.S., has to absorb the entire cumulative trade surplus of the rest of the world, and therefore eat $500 billion a year of deficit.

MR. BERMAN: What’s your confidence level right now that the tax reform that has been discussed will get done?

MR. ROSS: Oh, I think we’ll get it. As you know, the precursor to it is health-care reform. And the reason we put that first isn’t that we thought it would be easy. It’s actually much harder than tax reform. But we need savings from it to help offset the immediate effect of some of the reductions in rate that we’re putting into the tax bill.

MR. BERMAN: So 70% chance, would you say?

MR. ROSS: I think we’re going to get tax reform, and I think we’ll get it this year. And as I understand it, this kind of tax reform could also be made retroactive. Whether they will or won’t, I don’t know. But it could very well be—if there’s enough enthusiasm for it.
