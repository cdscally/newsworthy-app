Lorna Jack, the chief executive of the Law Society, is optimistic about working with the Scottish Legal Complaints Commission

Slow. Cumbersome. Expensive. Fails to deliver for solicitors or clients. A critique of legal regulation from a customer? No, it’s the departed Law Society of Scotland president Eilidh Wiseman describing the system of regulation as she welcomed the independent review set up by the Scottish government. The system is in bad shape and the review is not seen as a quick fix.

The group will report by the end of next year, with a government response and legislative timetable to follow. Some feel this is too long. Others accept it’s a huge job and think the timescale makes a positive outcome more likely.

Lorna Jack, chief executive of the Law Society, says: “We are working with acts from 1980, 2007 and 2010. It’s clumsy. The…

Tony Blair should be prosecuted for the "unnecessary" and "unlawful" Iraq war, the High Court in London was told yesterday.

Lawyers for General Abdul Wahed Shannan Al Rabbat, Iraq's chief of staff under Saddam Hussein, said the former prime minister had committed "the crime of aggression" by invading in 2003.

Rabbat is seeking permission to launch a private prosecution against Blair, together with former foreign secretary Jack Straw and Lord Goldsmith, attorney general at the time, reports The Independent. The move was blocked last year by Westminster magistrates court, which ruled Blair would have immunity from any criminal charges.

That attempt followed the publication of the Chilcot inquiry, which said Blair had taken the UK to war on the false claim that Iraq posed an imminent threat to the West.

"After the Chilcot report was released some families of British service personnel who lost their lives in Iraq said they wanted Blair prosecuted in the courts," The Guardian says.

Rabbat's lawyer, Michael Mansfield, told the High Court that "Saddam Hussein did not pose an urgent threat to the UK, intelligence reporting about [Iraqi] weapons of mass destruction was presented with unwarranted certainty, that the war was unnecessary and that the UK undermined the authority of the UN security council", reports The Guardian.

Mansfield added: "Nothing could be more emphatic than these findings. It was an unlawful war."

Attorney General Jeremy Wright says the general's case is "hopeless" and unarguable because the crime of aggression is not recognised in English law and urged the Lord Chief Justice to block the challenge.

Who is General Rabbat?

Rabbat was governor of Nineveh province when the US-led invasion began in 2003.

He "lives in Oman, does not possess a passport and could not be at the hearing", says The Sun. "But the courtroom was filled with citizens from Middle Eastern countries who are supporting his bid for a private prosecution against the architects of the war."

Will Blair's immunity be overturned?

Lawyers for the Attorney General argue that the crime of aggression, while existing in international law, has never been included in English law by parliament. They cited a 2006 House of Lords ruling, R v Jones, which unanimously found that the international crime of aggression is not an offence under domestic legislation in the UK

However, says The Guardian, "the government's stance appears to be undermined by Lord Goldsmith", who, in a memo from 2003 on the legality of the war, "appeared to concede the key point of those now seeking his prosecution".

Goldsmith wrote: "Aggression is a crime under customary international law which automatically forms part of domestic law."

The two judges ruling on the case said they would give their decision at a later date.

Russia has announced a new recruitment drive for astronauts in the hope they will be the first Russians to land on the Moon.

The country's space agency Roscosmos is looking for six to eight astronauts who will operate a new-generation spaceship now in development. They "will become the first Russians to fly to the Moon," reports The Guardian.

Russia is keen to rekindle the space triumphs of the Soviet era after a series of embarrassing glitches in recent years, says France24.

It has set 2031 as the target date for its first manned Moon landing.

There are several stages of selection. The successful candidates will have to demonstrate good English and computer knowledge, and have the ability to learn all about spacecrafts and how they operate.

"A high standard of fitness is a must and would-be astronauts have to cross-country ski for 5km," says The Guardian.

Candidates will also have to fit very specific physical standards, says the Calvert Journal. "They have to be 150 to 190 cm tall, weigh between 50 and 90 kilos, and wear shoe size UK 11 or smaller."

After the December deadline, Roscosmos will begin the selection process. Once the six to eight astronauts are selected, the group will attend the Yuri A. Gagarin State Scientific Research-and-Testing Cosmonaut Training Center in the outskirts of Moscow to prepare.

This is the 17th recruitment call for Russian astronauts. The last one took place in 2012, says Newsweek.

Of the 30 members of Russia's current astronaut team, 14 have never gone into outer space.

Just months after many people expected Samsung to completely retire the Note brand, the company is set to launch refurbished units of the disastrous Galaxy Note 7.

The handset, as we all know, was recalled after several devices caught fire, then re-issued with apparently safe new batteries that also turned out to be highly dangerous, before being recalled again, banned on flights across the world, and eventually discontinued.

Or apparently not. Samsung has decided to resurrect the handset with a slightly new name, in the hope that enough time has passed and assurances have been made to convince consumers that they should buy the Note 7 over any other phone on the market.

What went wrong with the original?

Samsung conducted a lengthy investigation into the matter and, as widely expected, a multitude of battery faults were to blame.

The first issues were traced back to the batteries manufactured by Samsung subsidiary Samsung SDI.

Samsung said the main problem with them was that “the negative electrode was deflected in the upper-right corner”, but added that an incorrectly located negative electrode tip was an issue too.

The company’s response to the initial wave of explosion reports was to expand production of Note 7s equipped with batteries made by a separate supplier, Hong Kong-based Amperex Technology. Unfortunately, these were also faulty.

“High welding burrs on the positive electrode resulted in the penetration of the insulation tape and separator which then caused direct contact between the positive tab with the negative electrode,” explained Samsung in January, adding that a number of Amperex Technology-made Note 7s were also missing insulation tape.

Safety checks

The Note 7 catastrophe prompted multiple grovelling apologies from Samsung executives, and led to the firm pushing back the launch of the Galaxy S8.

Before its unveiling, the company announced its new ‘8-Point Battery Safety Check’, a rather dull breakdown of its manufacturing process designed to convince consumers that none of the huge errors it made with the Note 7 would ever happen again.

Unfortunately for Samsung, it also had the effect of causing an increasing number of them to question why such a process wasn’t already in place.

The ‘new’ Galaxy Note 7

Following months of rumours, Samsung has confirmed that it will re-launch the Note 7 as the Note 7 ‘Fan Edition’ on 7 July.

It’s a bizarre choice of name, which has led some to joke that Samsung might not have had a problem if the original Note 7 had been fitted with a fan.

The company has decided not to build a completely new phone, but to refurbish recalled and unsealed Note 7 handsets with unused components and batteries that “have passed new safety measures”.

These batteries will have a lower capacity to the 3,500mAh batteries that powered the original, with 3,200mAh being suggested by some reports.

Other than that and the addition of the so-far highly disappointing Bixby voice assistant, the models are expected to be exactly the same, featuring the same 5.7-inch Quad HD display and 12-megapixel camera that won so much praise when the phone first launched.

Unsurprisingly, it won't cost as much as the original. Samsung is yet to announce official numbers, but recent reports say it will be available for around £470, far less than the £699 it retailed for at launch.

Whether that's enough of a price reduction to persuade people to purchase what will be a year-old phone with a dangerous reputation remains to be seen.

Bovis reiterated today that it is slowing its rate of production to deal with issues of build quality Rui Vieira/PA

Bovis Homes has set aside a further £3.5 million to cover compensation and remedial work for customers affected by its poor-quality building as it tries to move on from a scandal that rocked the housebuilder at the start of the year.

In January, Bovis was discovered to be offering customers as much as £3,000 to move into unfinished homes in a desperate attempt to reach City targets of building 4,000 homes a year.

The cash offer was revealed days after the housebuilder’s chief executive, David Ritchie, had unexpectedly resigned after a shock post-Christmas profit warning.

Customers who were asked by Bovis to complete on their homes early claimed there were many issues with the properties, including windows still needing to be installed, gardens or porches…

US pop star Ariana Grande has paid tribute to Saffie Roussos, the youngest victim of the Manchester Arena bombing.

The eight-year-old was with her family when suicide bomber Salman Abedi detonated a home-made device, killing 22 people including seven children.

Following a concert in Buenos Aires on Wednesday, Grande tweeted: “Saffie, we're (thinking) of you baby” alongside a birthday cake emoji.

The youngster, from Leyland, Lancashire, would have celebrated her ninth birthday on 4 July.

To mark the occasion her family chose to speak out, paying tribute to Saffie and remembering how she had looked forward to the concert.

What's newwwww, Buenos Aires

Argentina, I love you

☁️

Saffie, we're 💭 of you baby 🎂 https://t.co/UgMSWqxesf — Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) July 6, 2017

Her older sister, Ashlee Bromwich, said the super fan was “elated” as she watched her idol on perform on 22 May.

“She was Ariana Grande-obsessed, so to see how happy she was, it was just... obviously I had to go with her,” she told the BBC.

Her father, Andrew Roussos, said: “You couldn't be out with Saffie without having fun, but her dream was to be famous. It was her everything and we bought her the tickets for Christmas.

“She was just counting the days, the seconds and it was just Ariana Grande until nine, 10 o'clock at night. And she would sing and dance every single song.”

The explosion ripped through the arena foyer as thousands of fans, mostly young girls, left the venue following Grande's performance.

Mr Roussos, who said “all hell broke loose” after the bombing, was later told by a police detective that Saffie had died.

Thousands of people flocked to the ancient site of Stonehenge this morning to see sunrise on the summer solstice, the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere.

The UK will experience 16 hours and 38 minutes of daylight today – as well as record-breaking temperatures. Here's what else to expect from the ancient pagan festival:



The origin of the summer solstice

The name derives from the Latin words for sun, "sol", and "sistere", meaning "to stand still". In the West, its festivals are associated with pagans, for whom the longest day had both practical and religious significance. It was a fixed point around which the planting and harvesting of crops could be planned, but also marked the spiritual side of the shifting of the seasons.

The significance of Stonehenge

The ancient structure in Wiltshire is thought to have been designed in part to honour the earth's solstices and equinoxes and has been a sacred place of worship and celebration for the summer solstice for thousands of years.

"In addition to the large events at major sites such as Stonehenge, many more Pagans hold small ceremonies in open spaces, everywhere from gardens to woodlands," says the BBC.

Traditions and beliefs

Pagans have always believed the summer solstice holds a special power, says the Daily Telegraph. "It was believed to be a time when the veil between this world and the next is at its thinnest and when fairies were thought to be at their most powerful," according to the newspaper.

Singing, dancing, and music are central to present-day celebrations across Europe. The summer solstice is a national holiday in Sweden and Finland, where it is known as Midsummer's Eve. Homes are cleaned and decorated with flowers, and many people throw midsummer parties around bonfires.

Hottest solstice in history?

As Britain basks in a heatwave, forecasters are predicting that today's temperatures could break records. "If the mercury surpasses the 31.7C recorded at Camden Square, north London, in 1936, it will be the hottest summer solstice on record," says the Daily Telegraph.

The record for June as a whole was set in 1976, when temperatures reached 35.6C in Southampton.

Yesterday social media seethed with anger and contempt over a tomato salad. Yes, Nigella Lawson had posted a picture of her “old-fashioned tomato salad” on Instagram, and many responded like this Facebook user: “I REALLY hope this is a joke!? This is a dish of cherry tomatoes cut in half, with a squirt of salad cream . . . get over youself for goodness sake!!!”

Lawson has form for outraging the public with her salad recipes — remember her deconstructed caesar one made of burnt lettuce with a fried egg on top? — but frankly the criticism seemed deeply unfair. Weren’t tomatoes and salad cream a British summer classic — albeit more Essex than Knightsbridge — ripe for celebration?

I’ve always loved salad cream, although…

Ferrari has launched an entry-level turbo variant of its GTC4 Lusso shooting-brake - and it's already getting rave reviews from the critics.

The GTC4 Lusso is aimed at attracting a younger demographic who want an everyday car with a "sporty" edge, says the car company.

It's also expected to be a hit in China, reports Car, as the smaller and more economical turbo engine will avoid "heavy tax penalties" placed on vehicles with large engines.

Ferrari has swapped-out the range-topper's naturally aspirated V12 motor with a 3.9-litre twin-turbo V8. While it loses 80bhp from its V12 sibling's 682bhp power output, the V8 model boosts the torque output from 514lb-ft to 560lb-ft.

The GTC4 Lusso T also does away with the V12's all-wheel drive system in favour of a rear-wheel drive set-up, coupled to a seven-speed automatic gearbox that takes the 3,836lbs car go from zero to 62mph in 3.5secs and on to a top speed of 199mph.

It also undercuts the V12 by £30,000 - but how does it compare to its sibling on the road?

Evo says that while the GTC4 Lusso T drops four cylinders on its range-topping sibling, it "is only fractionally slower" thanks to the company's "Variable Boost Management system".

As this reduces lag, a common side effect of turbocharging, it allows the shooting-brake to rev all the way to 7,500rpm - 500rpm shy of the mid-engined Ferrari 488.

The seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox gives the same "thumping" changes as the V12 model, while the rear-wheel steering makes the car feel "appreciably more agile" than the all-wheel drive layout as the range-topping GTC4, continues the magazine.

Autocar agrees, praising the car's poise and sharper steering response. However, it adds, grip at the rear-end is "somewhat less secure" and the tractional control system will often step in to prevent a skid.

Running the Lusso T in comfort mode can make it unexpectedly "float", but a "quick stab at a steering wheel button" will stiffen the springs and while the suspension isn't particularly quiet, this could be a symptom of the car's tyre width.

In its review, AutoExpress says the "compliant" ride deteriorates once driven on a motorway and that the car is not very comfortable when dealing with bumps in the road. The wheels also have "a tendency to tramline".

Nevertheless, it adds, the engine is almost silent when cruising along at 70mph and the V8 engine jumps into life when the throttle is planted.

Orders are open now for the GTC4 Lusso T, with Top Gear reporting that prices start "a whisker under £200,000".

Ferrari reveals GT4C Lusso at Geneva

2 March

Latest creation is a reworked version of the FF – and it's a big hit with the critics

Ferrari's latest creation has taken to the stage at the Geneva Motor Show.

The GT4C Lusso shooting brake is essentially a renamed and reworked Ferrari FF with a facelift, built on the practical four-wheel drive V12 curio platform of its predecessor.

Front and rear have been tidied up quite extensively. A new, 488 GTB-inspired headlamp setup flanks a redesigned front grille, while at the back, tail-light clusters replace the big, round singular modules found on the FF. There is also a new rear diffuser and subtle lip spoiler.

The revisions have been a big success with critics. Autoblog says that getting Shooting Brake designs right is hard: "The Ferrari FF might have come closer than most, but even the most dedicated of tifosi [Ferrari fans] would have to admit it was a little awkward. The new GTC4 Lusso goes a long way towards setting that right."

The interior gets a slight rethink, marked out mostly by the new infotainment system in the form of a 10ins touchscreen. But there's changes underneath the skin, too.

Ferrari has bestowed the GT4C with an extra 29bhp over the FF for a total power output of 680bhp from its naturally aspirated 6.3-litre V12. It makes 0-62mph in 3.4 seconds and tops out at 208mph.

The four-wheel drive system has also received a tweak and now benefits from four-wheel steering and the addition of a slip-slide control system.

Prices have yet to be confirmed, but £230,000 seems likely.

The reveal of a four-wheel-drive four-seater has begged the inevitable questions over a Ferrari SUV – but the company's top brass has been quick to dismiss the idea.

According to Car magazine, Fiat group chief executive Sergio Marchionne has unequivocally ruled out any future Ferrari SUV or crossover, despite many of the firm's rivals jumping on the bandwagon.

"Whatever we do, we must not damage Ferrari as a supercar-maker," he said

However, he did indicate that Ferrari is actively considering new directions – although none of them lead down the electric road. Marchionne has ruled that out too, says CNN.

The organisers of the Los Angeles 2024 Olympic bid have denied conceding defeat to rivals Paris after bid leader Casey Wasserman said the city would be happy to stage the event in 2028.

Speaking yesterday, Wasserman said: "LA 2024 has never been only about LA or 2024. Even when the issue of a dual award for the 2024 and 2028 Games was initially raised, we didn't say, 'It's LA first' or 'It's now or never' for LA. That sounds like an ultimatum.

"We could have used that strategy, but we didn't because we thought it was presumptuous to tell the IOC [International Olympic Committee] what to do and how to think. We're better partners than that."

Although the LA bid team have denied Wasserman's statement amounts to a concession to Paris, it has been interpreted as a pitch for the 2028 Games.

The IOC is expected this week to announce it will take the unusual step of choosing the host cities for both 2024 and 2028 at a meeting in Peru in September.

However, there has been an "apparent lack of interest in staging sport's biggest event, as well as years of bad publicity about spiralling costs and unused venues", reports the BBC.

In order to secure the future of the event, the committee will "consider taking advantage of these two strong bids [Paris and LA] by giving them a Games each".

Finding a host for 2024 has proved a struggle. "The attraction of hosting the Olympics has dimmed in recent years with huge expenses and redundant venues haunting the IOC," says The Guardian. "Hamburg, Rome, Budapest and Boston have all dropped out of the bidding process for 2024, partly due to protests from citizens concerned their cities would be saddled with debts."

Paris is adamant it wants the Games in 2024, the 100th anniversary of the last time it hosted the event. It also claims the site it has earmarked for the athletes' village will not be available after 2024.

Meanwhile, several IOC members are concerned about the presidency of Donald Trump, who could feasibly still be in office in 2024.

"For much of its campaign, LA 2024 has sought to play the role of the good guy, distancing itself from the arrogant 'ugly American' tag hung on previous unsuccessful US bids, says the LA Times.

"This stance becomes even more relevant at a time when President Trump has rankled leaders around the world.

"Wednesday's statement continued LA 2024's strategy while also serving as a thinly veiled dig at Paris, which has repeatedly pushed back against the idea of accepting 2028. But none of that diminishes that Wasserman clearly signalled a willingness to cooperate with the potential two-winner arrangement. The timing is significant."

If you want your photography and videos to become even more immersive, then 360-degree cameras are for you. Whether you're trying to capture a cityscape from a high viewpoint, recreate the experience of an amazing gig with footage that captures both the crowd and the band, or cover all angles while filming some extreme sport, this emerging market has you covered.

360-degree cameras and videos can be split broadly into two camps: single and dual lens. The former avoids the need to stitch images together, although it does sometimes leave blackspots around the edges where no images have been captured. The latter can achieve full 360-degree coverage, although with some cheaper models you can tell that the images have been stitched together.

Once you’ve taken your 360-degree videos and pictures, the next question is how to view and share them. The ever-growing world of virtual reality offers an ideal way to relive the memories you've captured, while social media sites like Facebook and YouTube have 360 functionality (that said, other apps such as Instagram don't support 360 images themselves, although some third party apps can help with that).

We tested the following cameras taking into account a number of criteria: how practical and simple they are to use, whether they require further apps or software to use, what features they boast (such as 4K video), how long the battery life is, and overall value for money. Each of them were tested in open landscapes as well within the urban environment of London.

Something to bear in mind: as many of these cameras are small, handheld devices, it may be wise to invest in a monopod to help them reach higher viewpoints.

1. Samsung Gear 360: £219, Samsung

Launched alongside the Galaxy S8 earlier this year, this dual-lens camera is a significant upgrade on the previous 360 offering from Samsung. It shoots video in 4K Ultra HD at 24fps, and the still images look great, with minimal stitching visible, but still some blindspots. There are five different shooting modes – stills, video, time-lapses, looping videos and panoramas – which are chosen either on the camera or on a smartphone. The easy-to-use app, which you need to run the camera, is available for Android and iOS (the latter was missing previously). With an updated oblong shape, it’s comfortable to hold and somewhat negates the need for a monopod. It’s also got a huge capacity, with a microSD slot allowing for up to 256GB, and battery life should last you for around two hours – so make sure you head out knowing what you want to shoot. The small display can take some getting used to, but it’s a minor niggle of an excellent all-rounder.

2. Ricoh Theta SC: £219, John Lewis

This is the slightly simplified version of Ricoh’s already user-friendly 360 camera, the Theta S. This dual-lens camera is very similar to its predecessor, with the main difference being an absence of microSD slot for extra memory (the internal memory is 8GB). It also has a slightly cheaper feel than the S (as you’d expect for a cheaper price), but this is still a light (102g) and ergonomic piece of kit. The 14-megapixel resolution is sharp, and although it doesn’t shoot in 4K, the colours are still vivid, the stitching is impressive and the video is captured at 30fps. You can shoot either video or still images simply with the press of a single button, and then share it on social media thanks to the wi-fi connectivity. You can also control the camera through the Theta app, which is clearly and simply laid out, as well as available on both iOS and Android. Overall, this is a great first camera to have. Comes in three different colours.

3. LG 360 Cam: £179.99, Argos

Another easy-to-use, cheaper alternative is offered by LG (it runs best with an LG phone, but you can also use an iPhone, for example). This camera has dual lenses (but they only cover 200 degreees, so the stitching effect isn’t very noticeable), and the 13-megapixel cameras gives sharp still images, and works well for the 2K, 30fps videos it shoots. The handle design is easy to grip and the minimal buttons on the camera itself means the app is important to use – it runs smoothly and allows you to preview and review shots and videos. It’s also compatible with YouTube and Google Street View, with wi-fi connectivity. We found it gave around 90 minutes of battery life, which is pleasing considering the price. Although it can’t compete with the 4K alternatives, it’s an enjoyable, budget-friendly camera which is great for first-timers.

4. 360Fly 4K: £489, Currys

The single-lens camera would be a wise purchase if you’re looking to capture the great outdoors with your camera. It works under water, and also boasts an accelerometer, an electronic compass, its own GPS (great for geo-tagging your images) and a gyroscope to provide extra stability (that said, because of its spherical shape it would be best to invest in some sort of mount for it). It shoots video in 4K Ultra HD at 30fps, and at the same quality for still images (although the images are not stitched, the field of view is limited to 240 degrees, so there are small blindspots). There is one button to start and stop shooting, which makes it super simple to use – to change the shooting mode, you have to go via the intuitive app, available on both iOS and Android. You can also use it share your images and videos of YouTube and Facebook thanks to wi-fi and Bluetooth capability. It has an internal memory of 64GB.

5. Nikon KeyMission 360: £419, Currys

Firmly placed within the world of action cameras, this camera can be submerged to a depth of 30m, and is both freeze- and shock-proof, all while remaining relatively light at just 198g. It shoots video in 4K HD at 24fps, and we found it delivered some of the very best footage on our test. However, its still images, shot with a dual-lens, had visible stitching marks. There’s a microSD slot rather than internal memory, and the battery life is only around an hour, although there are interchangeable batteries which is great for when you’re on the go. It isn’t the most intuitive to use, with only one button performing a lot of different functions, so it can take some time to get to grips with. There are two apps available, too – SnapBridge and Utility – which allow you to easily review videos, shoot remotely and change your settings. You can also share online. If you’re looking for something rugged that excels at video, this is the one.

6. Kodak Explorer SP360 4K: £339.99, Currys

Somewhere between a sporty and urban-based camera, this is the second generation of the Kodak Pixpro 360 – and has significant improvements. It shoots in 4K Ultra HD at 30fps, and has an improved field of view from its single lens, at 235 degrees, which is similar to the 360Fly. Of course, as there is only one lens, you don’t have to worry about stitching. The USB connection means you can transfer files without a wi-fi connection (not possible on some of the models that are wholly reliant on apps), which is a bonus if you’re out in the wilderness. It’s only splashproof, so not suitable to be submerged, but it is shockproof up to 2m. There are many different packs and accessories available, like an underwater sport pack or a monopod, although these do come at an additional price. The app, available on iOS or Android, isn’t as straightforward or some others, but it still a solid performer.

The Verdict: 360 cameras

Our Best Buy goes to the Samsung Gear 360. The quality of the image and video are excellent, considering the price. The Samsung fits comfortably in any pocket and has very good software that can be used with any device, a big step beyond its predecessor. As a sporty camera, we like the 360Fly 4K – it’s quite expensive but highly satisfactory in terms of final result and durability.

Aid investments in the world’s poorest communities–often in rural areas–may be more expensive than in less-deprived regions, but can save nearly twice as many lives, a new study by the United Nations Children’s Fund published Tuesday shows. The analysis turns on its head the conventional focus of aid targeting easier-to-reach urban areas that aim to […]

This summer's transfer window could be one of the most exciting ever with some of world football's biggest names set for moves.

Cristiano Ronaldo, Alexis Sanchez, Kylian Mbappe and Alvaro Morata are just a handful of big-name players tipped for a move this summer, with the likes of Jose Mourinho, Arsene Wenger and Antonio Conte all eager to bolster their squads ahead of the new season.

Rather impressively, a number of clubs have already set about their business early. Manchester City are the summer’s early pace setters, having already signed both Bernardo Silva and Ederson, while Mohamed Salah recently joined Liverpool in a £34.3m move from Roma.

How Manchester United could line up next season







12 show all How Manchester United could line up next season





















1/12 How could United line up? Jose Mourinho's side have been linked with dozens of new signings, but who is most likely to line up for the club in time for the start of the 2017/18 season? Getty

2/12 Goalkeeper – David De Gea Reports in Spain now suggest De Gea will stay at United once again as Real Madrid have failed to convince the club to sell. Getty

3/12 Right back – Fabinho Jose Mourinho is a fan of Fabinho, who can play at both right-back and as a defensive midfielder. Monaco, however, do not want to lose many of the first-team stars which took them to a Champions League semi-final last season. Getty

4/12 Centre-back – Eric Bailly Bailly had a phenomenal first season at United and looks like he will be the bedrock of Mourinho’s defence for the foreseeable future. Getty

5/12 Centre-back – Victor Lindelof Victor Lindelof has joined the club from Benfica and will start in the heart of United's defence. Getty

6/12 Left-back – Kieran Tierney Mourinho is not a fan of Luke Shaw and Matteo Darmian looked unconvincing when deployed as a left-back last season. United could turn to £15m rated Celtic defender Kieran Tierney, who has established himself for both his club and country despite only being 20-years-old. United scouts were spotted watching the player in England's recent World Cup qualifier against Scotland. Getty

7/12 Midfield - Ander Herrera A fan favourite at Old Trafford, Herrera's tenacious performances in the middle of the park last season saw his stock rise immeasurably. With Wayne Rooney's days numbered, the Spaniard may be in line to take the captain's armband. Getty

8/12 Midfield – Nemanja Matic The signing of Matic is one that screams not only of the need for discipline in the heart of this United team, but one that reiterates how the Portuguese is looking for players who can help him win now, not a couple of years down the line. Getty

9/12 Midfield – Paul Pogba Mourinho is known to want to bring in a defensive midfielder in order to free up the Frenchman to operate further up the field. Getty

10/12 Left-wing - Marcus Rashford The young English forward has done enough to earn Mourinho's trust and should be used in the first XI far more next term. Getty

11/12 Right-wing – Ivan Perisic United are only willing to spend £35m on Perisic but Inter want £50m. The club are still confident they can push the deal through. Getty

12/12 Striker - Romelu Lukaku Mourinho has prioritised a new No.9 this summer following Zlatan Ibrahimovic's season-ending injury and subsequent release and has opted for Lukaku as his top choice. Getty Images

Arsenal finally completed the club record deal for Alexandre Lacazette to go with left-back Sead Kolasinac while Everton are the other big spenders so far in the window, signing Michael Keane for a club-record £30m and Sandro Ramirez to add to Jordan Pickford from Sunderland for £30m and Ajax’s Davy Klaassen for £23.6m.

President Trump on April 5 removed White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon from the National Security Council. Here's what you need to know. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)

THE MORNING PLUM:

Stephen K. Bannon has proven remarkably talented at creating a media mystique around himself. With his diligent assistance, he has been portrayed as both a virtuoso of deliberately orchestrated disruption and an avenging angel to working-class people (such as his father) who have been betrayed by global and financial elites. Bannon cleverly wields chaos to destabilize those elite foes in service of an economic nationalist mission that borders on Messianism.

But now Bannon is being primarily viewed inside the White House as a destructive force, and other senior advisers are trying to undermine him in the eyes of President Trump himself, according to multiple reports out this morning. Those reports undercut the narrative of Bannon as a Maestro of Disruption, and they also provide an occasion to probe the true nature of his self-ascribed economic nationalism.

The New York Times reports that Bannon’s removal on Wednesday from his post at the National Security Council is part of a broader internal push that may “diminish” his role. His position has been “undermined” by the failure of the immigration ban, which has been blocked by the courts. Trump “initially supported” Bannon when he delivered an ultimatum to House Republicans that they must vote on the GOP health-care bill or else (they didn’t vote), but then Trump handed off health care to Vice President Pence. And Bannon is clashing with Jared Kushner and irritating the Big Man himself:

Mr. Kushner … has said privately that he fears that Mr. Bannon plays to the president’s worst impulses, according to people with direct knowledge of such discussions. Moreover, Mr. Bannon’s Svengali-style reputation has chafed on a president who sees himself as the West Wing’s only leading man. Several associates said the president had quietly expressed annoyance over the credit Mr. Bannon had received for setting the agenda — and Mr. Trump was not pleased by the “President Bannon” puppet-master theme promoted by magazines, late-night talk shows and Twitter.

In practice, Bannonite disruption is upstaging the president and being blamed for the failure of the immigration ban. Recall that allies of Bannon initially cast the ban as a masterful coup. A senior administration official (gosh, who could that be?) recently told Bloomberg that Bannon deliberately arranged the release of the first ban on a Friday so that opponents could stage massive weekend protests that would draw maximum attention. Wow, disruption! In reality, Bannon made a hash of it.

[Five reasons why Bannon leaving the National Security Council matters]

What’s more, Kushner now allegedly believes that Bannon — presumably his combative nationalism — is aggravating Trump’s worst impulses. Politico’s reporting indicates a similar dynamic, in which Kushner sees Bannon as an “ideologue whose advice to Trump is making it harder for the president to win popular support,” and an ally of Bannon sees the clash as one between the “nationalists and the West Wing Democrats.”

Bannon himself has talked a great game about his “economic nationalism,” which is supposed to distinguish him from both the squishy globalists inside the White House and the Ayn Randian limited government Paul Ryan Republicans in Congress. But what has it really amounted to so far?

When the health bill was tanking, allies of Bannon leaked that he saw an opportunity to undermine Ryan, whose bill, Bannon believed, was “written by the insurance industry,” suggesting Bannon and Trump secretly harbor more populist impulses than Ryan on health care. But where’s the evidence of this? The White House fully embraced Ryanism at an absolutely critical moment, throwing in with a plan that would have hurt many lower-income Trump voters and rolled back coverage for millions, violating Trump’s pledge of “insurance for everybody” and his vow not to cut Medicaid, while delivering a huge tax cut for the rich. If Bannon has an actual plan or even a vague vision for a health-care alternative to the Ryanism that he supposedly disdains, we haven’t seen it.

[Alexandra Petri: Every story I have read about Trump supporters in the past week]

On taxes, Trump will forge ahead with a plan that delivers an enormous tax cut for the rich, and according to Robert Draper, Bannon may also be open to repeal of the estate tax. Populist! It’s possible we may see Bannon’s economic nationalism shape Trump’s coming agenda on infrastructure and trade. Bannon has vowed a massive public expenditure on infrastructure. But we still don’t know whether Trump’s actual plan will amount to much more than a tax break and privatization scheme. Perhaps Trump will get some species of border adjustment tax on imports. But we still don’t know whether Trump’s renegotiation of NAFTA will do anything to empower workers — and union leaders are skeptical based on what they’ve seen so far.

Bannon’s economic nationalism deserves more scrutiny. He claims he’s angry at Wall Street elites, but Trump has already moved to gut Wall Street oversight. This is not necessarily contradictory — Bannon believes Wall Street needs to regain its sense of responsibility to workers on its own — but that isn’t a plan, and at any rate, Bannon’s true anti-elite ire seems aimed at administrators and bureaucrats. In practice, this seems to be translating into massive proposed cuts to environmental oversight (that won’t actually restore coal jobs), science and medical research, and programs that spur economic development in Trump country.

Stephen K. Bannon, chief strategist to the White House, has emerged as one of the most powerful figures in Washington. Much of his world views can be traced back to his seven years in the Navy and a failed hostage rescue. (Alice Li/The Washington Post)

Based on what we’ve seen so far, what evidence is there that Bannon’s “economic nationalism” amounts to much more than the nativist nationalism we’ve seen — the travel ban, the immigration restrictionism, the wall on the Mexican border, and the support for assorted right-wing nationalist movements worldwide?

*********************************************************************************

* REPUBLICANS ARE SET TO ‘GO NUCLEAR’: The Post reports that Mitch McConnell is reassuring fellow senators that ending the filibuster on Supreme Court nominations — which will happen this week — won’t lead to scrapping it on legislation:

McConnell has tried to reassure his GOP colleagues that will not happen. He says that all presidential nominees will now be free of the filibuster hurdle, returning the chamber to its traditional role of voting them up or down. “There’s not a single Senator in the majority who thinks we ought to change the legislative filibuster. Not one,” he said.

This is actually plausible, in part because ending the filibuster on legislation would likely be a lot worse for Republicans over the long haul than it would be for Democrats.

* REPUBLICANS IN ‘EMERGENCY’ SCRAMBLE ON HEALTH CARE: Politico reports that House Republicans may hold an “emergency meeting” today in a last-ditch effort to revive the repeal push before going on recess:

Two sources did not believe the hearing, if scheduled, would have an immediate impact on the legislative calendar. Lawmakers are slated to leave town for a two-week Easter recess starting Thursday … discussions of a potential last-minute hearing show that Republicans aren’t giving up yet and are feeling pressure to act quickly.

The reaction that Republicans get on recess to their deeply unpopular repeal push may end out outweighing that “pressure to act quickly.”

* THE CALENDAR IS WORKING AGAINST GOP REPEAL PUSH: CBS News notes a crucial point:

Members are scheduled to leave for their spring break Thursday without having voted on health care. They’ll return on April 24 to face another challenge — government funding runs out days after they come back, on April 28.

So after hearing from constituents, members of Congress will immediately plunge into a government shutdown fight, pushing any action on repeal further into the future.

* TRUMP’S LATEST CLAIM ABOUT SUSAN RICE APPEARS BOGUS: Trump is now saying that Susan Rice, the national security adviser under Obama, may have committed a crime. Glenn Kessler examines the claim and finds it doesn’t add up:

On the face of it, Trump’s assertion is absurd. Numerous former national security officials told The Fact Checker that Rice, as national security adviser, had every right to request the identities of U.S. citizens who were incidentally recorded or referenced in surveillance conducted by the National Security Agency.

As Kessler notes, it’s not clear what Trump is pinpointing as a possible crime: the incidental collection of data on U.S. citizens, or the leaking of info about it. It’s unlikely Trump himself knows.

* PRESIDENT SPENDS LOTS OF TIME ON HIS PROPERTIES: The New York Times has a useful tally of Trump’s visits thus far to his properties: He’s visited Mar-a-Lago 17 times; his Palm Beach golf course 10 times; and a few other spots a handful of other times.

Conclusion: “Ethics experts argue that Mr. Trump’s visits to properties that are owned, managed or branded by the Trump Organization amount to free publicity for the company, blurring the line between his family business and his presidential duties.” Actually, it’s taxpayer-funded publicity.

* ACTIVISTS PRESSURE TRUMP ON TAXES: NPR reports that activists are planning multiple marches on April 15 to pressure Trump to release his tax returns. He has said he intends to release them but can’t because he’s under audit (which is nonsense). NPR notes:

Here’s a way around the audit problem: The president can disclose his new return at the same time he files it — before the IRS can start an audit.

Surely Trump will leap at this opportunity to do what he himself claims to want to do.

* ONE QUOTE THAT SUMS UP THE SYRIA HORROR: The Post reports that the chemical attack that killed scores of Syrian civilians was likely a “banned nerve agent,” and talks to families who lost loved ones:

“If the world wanted to stop this, they would have done so by now,” a woman who gave her name as Om Ahmed said in a telephone interview. “One more chemical attack in a town the world hasn’t heard of won’t change anything.” Then her voice cracked. “I’m sorry. My son died yesterday,” she said. “I have nothing left to say to the world.”

Spider-Man: Homecoming has finally reached cinemas, solidifying the web-slinger's place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe after debuting in Captain America: Civil War.

Of course, that’s not where Peter Parker’s role ends, far from it. According to Marvel head Kevin Feige, we can expect Spider-Man to kickstart everything following the fourth, as-yet-untitled Avengers film.

Already, seeds have been sown regarding what to expect thanks to Homecoming’s mid-credits scene. **Warning: spoilers ahead for Homecoming**

Following a quick flurry of credits, we see Michael Keaton’s Vulture in prison, speaking to another comic-book character, Mac Gargan — better known as The Scorpion — played by Michael Mando.

Gargan appears earlier in the film, purchasing Chitauri weaponry, but gets imprisoned after an encounter with Spider-Man. During the mid-credits scene, the character, itching his Scorpion tattoo, asks whether Vulture knows who the superhero really is, saying there are “friends on the outside” wanting revenge.

Little more is shown than this small set-up, but having friends on the outside is relatively revealing. Could Gargan be referring to a team of villains, perhaps the Sinister Six?

Sony almost released a Sinister Six film following The Amazing Spider-Man, cancelling the picture after a negative response to that blockbuster. The team could finally make an appearance.

However, Scorpion was not a primary member of the Sinister Six, only appearing in alternative versions of the team, so another group of villains should probably be expected. (Main S6 line-up was Doctor Octopus, Electro, Kraven the Hunter, Mysterio, Sandman, and Vulture.)

Perhaps relevant is Gargan’s lack of fame; often Marvel villains are played by acclaimed actors, such as Keaton, Ben Kingsley, Robert Redford, Hugo Weaving and others. So expect a somewhat bigger baddie come the sequel.

Still, we should expect further street villains to be pursuing Spider-Man come the sequel to Homecoming — if Thanos hasn’t destroyed the world by then.

Jack Butland has hinted he’d jump at the chance to join Manchester United (Picture: Getty)

Stoke City goalkeeper Jack Butland has hinted he’d jump at the chance to join Manchester United after hailing the Red Devils as ‘the biggest club in the world’.

The England international returned from a year out with a troublesome ankle injury in April to make six appearances for the Potters.

Romelu Lukaku set to join Man Utd in time for pre-season tour as £75m bid is accepted

The 24-year-old was putting pressure on Joe Hart to become England’s number one before his injury and has been tipped in parts to replace David De Gea at Old Trafford.

De Gea’s been heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid and Butland’s suggested he would love to be Jose Mourinho’s number one at the Theatre of Dreams.

Butland joined Stoke in 2013 (Picture: Getty)

‘If it’s the right move at the time, you never know. United, for me, are the biggest club in the world,’ said Butland.

‘I want to play in the Champions League & I want to win trophies. There’s no reason why we can’t win a cup at Stoke.’

United are desperate to keep hold of De Gea this summer and have not discussed the Spaniard moving to Real Madrid in their talks with the La Liga giants over Alvaro Morata’s move to England.

However, Butland’s words are timely and Mourinho is known to be an admirer of the former Birmingham City stopper.

“Rainbow people make this,” says Mussalem as he resets the mystical-looking stones decorating the sand. He is talking about The Rainbow Family of Living Light – the Oregon-born group committed to achieving peace and love on earth which holds gatherings in Egypt. “From all over the world they came here to feast, to play music, just to be in a natural place. Some very intelligent, very wise.” He looks up and smiles: “Some crazy.”

Though I might not be in The Rainbow Family myself, packing a £10 eBay tent with snapped poles, boots now bound by duct tape and shouldering a rucksack held together with string, a few days into Egypt’s first long-distance hiking route it’s clear to which category I belong.

The 137-mile-long Sinai Trail, or Darb Sina, is part of a Middle East-wide hiking network voted the number one new trail in the world by National Geographic. It’s neither the longest or the hardest of the world’s long-distance routes but hiking a landscape steeped in history, guided by Bedouin whose lives are intertwined with the land, is definitely one of the most rewarding.

These days life is hard for the Bedouin of Sinai. Generations past led pilgrims through the mountains to the 6th century St Catherine’s monastery or far further beyond to Mecca. In recent years events such as the Arab spring, revolution, coup d’état, insurgency and an airliner bombing have curtailed tourism in Sinai. “This trail creates work in a difficult time,” says Mussalem. “But not just any work.”

Sometimes ropes were necessary to haul each other over obstacles (Nick Redmayne )

“We are worried a little bit about our culture – the young Bedouin, they don’t know much,” says Nassr, another guide. “We want to keep travelling, living the simple life. We want to keep our tribes, our families together. Training new guides means there will be others to carry on.” The trail is the collective endeavour of three Bedouin tribes, championed by local volunteers, and an NGO – with no help from the government.

Breaking camp along the trail

Since leaving the Gulf of Aqaba at Ras Shitan on the Sinai coast we’ve walked through desert wadis, squeezed through intestinal gorges, and used rope to haul each other through epic boulder fields. The route is expected to take 12 days, ending on the summit of Egypt’s highest mountain, Jebel Katarina.

Now around 35km in we reach the towering stack of Jebel Milehis in south-east Sinai. Below, pillared rock formations carpeted with soft, ochre sand create a natural amphitheatre. The caravan relaxes into a disarray of tents, bed rolls and bags. This is home for the night. The camels settle too – into nosebags of corn, for once silent in their deep-seated disdain for our enterprise.

We number 22, mostly Egyptian along with resident foreigners and a few visiting ones. Bedouin guides from southern Sinai’s Tarabin, Muzeina and Jebelaya tribes lead the way, supported by a changing cast of trainee guides, cooks, cameleers and camels. Ours is the first group to brave the entire trail.

Cameleers overtake hikers en route to the evening’s camp

In the morning it’s the ascent of Jebel Milehis. Steep at first, weathered sandstone is clean and firm, the easy grip a welcome change from soft sand. The party is soon strung out, the two Mohameds leading us – wiry, surefooted Jordanians – to the fore as usual. I inhabit the sweaty midfield, exchanging exaggeratedly polite chitchat with an Egyptian translator fascinated by British idioms. “I’m still glad we got rid of you bastards,” he says. Soon the track loses its sense of humour. Precipitous ledges test nerves but when help is needed a firm Bedouin hand is never far away.

At the first ridge hard-won height is grudgingly ceded as the path drops in a rearwards approach to the summit. We walk in full sun, sweat stinging our eyes. Nassr points out petroglyphs on jutting boulders – social media from another age. “Look at the camel tails – they’re up.” A tribal skirmish is recorded in stone. Riders gallop, spears and bows raised. These are the victors.

Now begins the real climb. An indistinct path zigzags across a scree face. “Be careful,” Mussalem, “there are many loose rocks, think of the persons below.” He is right. Tumbling rocks and shouts of warning punctuate the ascent. Pausing to drink I peer down. The landscape appears unforgiving – and it is.

The initial summit of Jebel Milehis

Eventually the summit dome heaves into view. Alternately baked by the sun and chilled by desert nights, bare rock acquires ceramic fragility, tinkling as we walked over it. Looking east, the Gulf of Aqaba is visible, beyond it rises the emphatic ridgeline of Saudi Arabia’s mighty Hejaz mountains. One of the Jordanians takes out a flute and plays. His companion rolls a cigarette. Others lay on their backs, keffiyehs covering their faces. Six mountains lie along the trail.

After the immense expanse of the Blue Desert, 18 hikers remain, with sickness, fatigue and muscle strain having retired there others. These guys have grown stronger, more confident. Making camp by torchlight, harried by bone-chilling winds, levels us all. Ahead it is higher, colder and more remote.

Final camp on the summit of Jebel Katarina

Entering the High Mountains of Egypt, a circle of jagged peaks surrounding Jebel Katarina, morning sunshine accompanies flurries of frost shaken from tents. Jebel Katarina delivers its promise of an unrelenting climb, opposed by icy winds and taunted by false summits. Firewood gathered along the way is strapped to rucksacks. Conversations are lost to buffeting gusts. Private thoughts, expletives for each misplaced footfall, compete with laboured breathes and thumping heartbeats.

The sun sets over Africa as we reach the highest point. Photographs are taken, embraces exchanged. Burnt umbra skies bleach, fade to grey, then darken. Later, huddled around a smoky fire, sheltered by the walls of a half-enclosed refuge, Nassr pours glasses of hot chocolate for some and so-called Egyptian champagne for others. (Not bad actually – better than some proseccos.) “The people of the villages, they’ve heard about those who walked Darb Sina. It’s been a long time since so many have trekked,” says Nassr. “The Bedouin are happy, there will be work again. And each one of you, now you have a story.”

Day

Today's highlight is the included visit to the haunting ruins of Roman Pompeii, miraculously 'preserved' by the eruption of Vesuvius in AD79. Having been forgotten for hundreds of years, the city was rediscovered in the 18th Century. Since then, excavations have gradually revealed its magnificent villas, temples and frescoed houses.



Afterwards you'll journey around the bay, past the brooding hulk of Vesuvius to one of Italy's most colourful cities, the great southern Italian capital Naples. Highlights of a guided tour will include Garibaldi and Plebiscito squares, the lively 'Spaccanapoli' quarter, San Carlo Opera House and the Royal Palace. You'll also take in the medieval, turreted Castel Nuovo and the spectacular view from Posillipo Hill, which rises up above the city.

In a wide ranging interview with the BBC, Sir John Chilcot said Tony Blair was "not straight with the nation" and relied on belief rather than fact to take Britain into the Iraq War.

That the conflict was an unmitigated disaster, a historic mistake that casts a pall over the body politic to this day, is now accepted by just about everyone not completely won over by that belief at the time. And even by some who were.

But have we really learned anything? Has Sir John’s report into the conflict, and what he said during that interview, taught us anything?

With the country embarking on another historic mistake – Brexit – I’d say not.

On the face of it, there wouldn’t appear to be all that many parallels between the two, but there are if you think about it.

Brexit, too, is motivated by belief in opposition to fact, and expert advice.

Just as happened prior to the Iraq war, it had a corps of fierce partisans backing it, people who were willing to deploy a tissue of lies and half truths to convince a narrow majority of the public of their case.

Just as then, tens, hundreds, of thousands have taken to the streets in protest, only to be ignored or, worse still, to have their patriotism and loyalty called into question.

“I think the country’s had enough of experts,” said the member for Murdoch Central, Michael Gove, who was, at the time, the home news editor of The Times, a newspaper that supported the war. It speaks volumes, doesn’t it?

The big difference between the two is, of course, that Brexit will not see brave young men and women put in harm’s way. Nor will there be any killing of civilians by stray ordinance.

Poverty kills, mind. So, if the economic fallout from Brexit is as bad as some fear, there will be blood on the hands of its backers. A lot less than was shed in Iraq, it is true, but blood all the same.

Minister appointed to negotiate Brexit wanted EU 'torn down'

Belief rather than fact. In a modern, wealthy democracy, which provides an education for its people, it shouldn’t be that way. But it is.

Blair's reliance on belief is what makes him such a problematic figurehead for those who would oppose the country’s current lunacy. He’s a "big beast". A genuine talent, in an age when they are extraordinarily hard to find in British politics.

By comparison to him, both sides of the continuing Brexit debate look small, mean and timid.

But it is all but impossible to call upon the man who once led the country down a deep, dark hole to try and save it from another, as has sometimes been mooted.

Chilcot’s comment doesn’t really cast any new light on things. Most everyone who has followed this story will already have been aware that belief won with Blair. And those who still back his decision, in the face of all the evidence showing that it was a bad one? Their minds will never be changed. They too are motivated by a belief, one that has turned into a faith, just as it is faith that motivates Brexiteers.

Faith can be a dangerous thing if the certainty it confers on adherents is destructive.

Iraq proves that too. The pity of it is we are still prone to blindly follow zealots.

There was a brief moment when it looked like we had understood, or least when MPs showed that they might have understood.

Despite intense pressure being put upon them, they denied David Cameron when he asked for permission to bomb Syria in the wake of an appalling chemical attack that was almost certainly the work of the Assad regime.

Another Labour leader, Ed Miliband, speaking after the vote, said Britain had “learned the lessons of Iraq”.

It looks like he got that wrong.

Given the pit into which politics has descended of late, the shabby deal the Conservatives entered into with a party of faith based sectarian zealots from Northern Ireland, I’m not sure we will be able to trust Parliament to save us the next time it is tested.

Brexit is an act of economic and geopolitical stupidity, but despite the paranoid fantasies of some in the Brexit camp about EU armies with designs on forcing Britain into a superstate, and yes there are people who actually think that, no weapons will be drawn. No gun will be fired and no bomb will be dropped. Let’s be thankful for that, at least.

However, there will come a time, and perhaps quite soon, when a Prime Minister calls for weapons to be raised and bombs to be dropped, based on the belief that it is the only way to solve some awful problem somewhere.

It will matter not that the facts show that violence only results in more violence, and solves nothing, particularly in the quagmire that is the Middle East.

Belief will win out. And people will die.

HONG KONG Authorities in Hong Kong this week made their largest haul of contraband ivory in more than 30 years, amid surging illegal wildlife seizures fuelled by lax regulations and buoyant demand from mainland China.

The former British colony situated at the mouth of China's Pearl River Delta is one of the world's top global transit hubs for endangered species and their products, such as shark fin, pangolin skin and rosewood furniture.

Customs officials on Thursday said they had seized 7,200 kg (15,873 lb) of ivory tusks, valued at around HK$72 million ($9.22 million), at a cargo warehouse beside the city's harbor.

The ivory was discovered in a 40-foot container from Malaysia declared to hold frozen fish, beneath which officers found the tusks.

"The 1,000 boxes were half-empty when we found them with frozen fish put around the ivory," said customs official Raymond Chan.

Conservation group WildAid estimated the tusks had probably been taken from about 720 elephants.

Hong Kong's agriculture, fisheries and conservation department said it was investigating the shipment's final destination, probably a nearby country.

A special administrative region of China, Hong Kong has lagged other places, including the mainland, in adopting tighter rules against trading of ivory and other endangered species.

Regulatory loopholes allow traders to use a stockpile of legal ivory as cover to smuggle illegal ivory to unsuspecting buyers, say groups such as the World Wildlife Fund and WildAid.

China, Singapore and the United States have all banned the ivory trade, with the mainland closing down all operations by the end of this year.

Hong Kong, however, has only timetabled a ban by 2021. Legislators are set to discuss the issue on Friday and decide if traders should be compensated in the case of a total ban.

The teeming port city has the largest retail market for ivory, with 90 percent of consumers from the mainland.

Hong Kong has been trading ivory for more than 150 years, fashioned into jewelry and sculptures, but activists say illegal poaching is pushing elephants toward extinction.

The independent Environmental Investigation Agency last week identified Shuidong, a southern Chinese coastal town close to Hong Kong, as the hub for 10 to 20 Chinese-led criminal syndicates bringing in ivory from Africa.

African rangers detailed harrowing firsthand tales of elephant poaching during a June visit to Hong Kong, an event marked by a tense standoff with traders who say their business is legal.

Alexandre Lacazette signed for Arsenal on Tuesday evening, reports the Daily Mirror, in what the paper says is "a record-breaking £52m deal".

The 26-year-old French forward jetted into London from Lyon for his medical and, once completed, he signed a five-year contract that is expected to make him Arsenal’s top earner on £200,000 a week.

Lacazette was introduced to his new team-mates at the Arsenal training ground and the Mirror says he "may join their pre-season trip to Australia and China".

The paper claims he won't be the last big name to arrive at the Emirates in the coming weeks, with Arsene Wenger "prepared to carry on spending".

The Arsenal manager is still tracking Thomas Lemar but Monaco have demanded a staggering £80m for their playmaker.

Wenger has yet to respond to the Monaco asking price but, according to the Mirror, he may decide that's too much and turn his attention to Leicester winger Riyad Mahrez, who is said to be "keen" to move to north London.

And Lacazette may be strutting his stuff at the Emirates next season with the support of another French frontman.

Sky Sports reports the gist of an interview Olivier Giroud gave to the Arsenal website in which the 30-year-old discusses talk of a possible summer exit.

Everton, West Ham and Marseille have all been linked with the Gallic goalscorer - with some reports on Merseyside claiming that the Toffees have agreed a £20m fee with Arsenal - but Giroud insists he doesn't want to leave north London.

"I want to carry on my good journey at Arsenal and I always want to give my best," he said. "I would love to win another title, or maybe more, until the end of my contract. The motivation is here, always doing your best to make your family proud."

And might Alexis Sanchez also be back for another term at the Emirates The Sun believes so, with the paper boldly claiming that the Chilean sorcerer "will be staying at Arsenal next season".

How come? It appears that both Bayern Munich and Manchester City have realised they haven't got the readies to meet Sanchez's exorbitant wage demands.

Bayern president Uli Hoeness has reportedly ruled out signing Sanchez, saying: "We are not going to pay... €25m [£22m] a year to get Sanchez."

City are also facing the prospect of a transfer ban because of alleged transfer impropriety and in any case Arsenal are said to be unwilling to sell one of their crown jewels to a Premier League rival.

Arsenal transfer news: Wenger eyes Carvalho and Martins

04 July

Arsenal are planning a double swoop on Sporting Lisbon for William Carvalho and Gelson Martins, reports The Sun.

With Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette expected to sign any day now in a £44m deal, it appears that Arsene Wenger has no plans to ease up on his spending spree. The Sun says

the Sporting pair will likely cost the Gunners gaffer £70m.

Taking Portuguese outlet A Bola as its source, the tabloid claims that Wenger "wants to beef up his midfield options" after growing tired of Arsenal’s fragility in that area in recent seasons.

Carvalho, 25, is a no-nonsense midfielder who has been linked to Manchester United in the past but apparently Wenger is confident he will land the Portugal international, and the same goes for Gelson Martins.

The 22-year-old scored seven times in 43 games last season and The Sun says it's the youngster's ability to operate as a winger or full-back that has caught the eye of the Arsenal manager.

Wenger has also had his eye on Thomas Lemar recently, but Talksport says that Monaco don't intend to play ball as far as a possible move is concerned.

The broadcaster claims the French champions intend to knock back approaches from both Arsenal and Manchester City, the latter being interested in signing full-back Benjamin Mendy.

Having already lost Bernardo Silva to City this summer, and with Tiemoue Bakayoko close to joining Chelsea for £35m, Monaco have decided enough is enough and Talksport says "they are putting their foot down when it comes to Lemar and Mendy".

Arsenal had hoped to lure winger Lemar to the Emirates but that won't happen, with French sports daily L'Equipe claiming it's been told by a Monaco insider that they are "no longer willing to part with any more of their star players".

Finally, the Daily Star says that Wenger is set for "crisis talks with Hector Bellerin" over reports he is being courted by Barcelona.

The Spanish giants have long been linked with the Arsenal defender (who came through the Barca youth set-up) and the Star says Wenger has had enough of the speculation.

When the two meet this week, it's expected that Wenger will tell Bellerin that he can forget about a move to Barcelona and he must honour his Emirates contract.

Arsenal transfer news – Lacazette is on his way

3 July

A done deal – that's the consensus among the British and French media as far as the Gunners and Alexandre Lacazette goes.

It was French TV station Telefoot who broke the news, which was quickly picked up by the likes of the Daily Star, who report that after "a week of intensive negotiations" with Lyon, a fee has been agreed and Lacazette is “set to put pen to paper on a five-year contract".

Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis has apparently been driving the deal forward and the Star says that the north London club will hand over £46m in return for the Gallic goal-machine.

French sports daily L'Equipe confirms the story and says that Lyon have already found Lacazette's replacement in Real Madrid marksman Mariano Diaz.

The Daily Mirror quotes the figure of £44m as the fee Arsenal will have to pay to secure Lacazette – that will still surpass the £42.5m club record fee they paid four years ago for Mesut Ozil – and the paper quotes Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas, saying that the deal will be completed in "one or two days", with reports that the French forward flew to London on Sunday to have a medical.

Meanwhile, The Sun reports that Everton are lining up a "shock £20m raid" for Olivier Giroud and the Toffees are confident that they can beat West Ham and Marseille and sign the French striker.

Everton boss Ronald Koeman has resigned himself to losing Romelu Lukaku this summer (with latest reports claiming Manchester United are ready to rival Chelsea for the Everton frontman), and the Dutchman believes Giroud has the skill set to do a job at Goodison Park.

Giroud has been linked with a move away from the Emirates for a while now, since losing his place in the starting line-up, and the Sun says Koeman "believes he can persuade him that his plans to make Everton a Champions League club offer him his best new career move".

The Gunners are unlikely to stand in his way given that they are so close to signing Lacazette.

Arsenal transfer news: Wenger turns attention to 'unsettled' Robert Lewandowski

30 June

They've failed to land Alexandre Lacazette, been floored in their attempt to land Kylian Mbappe but might it be third time lucky for the Gunners in the summer transfer market? According to Metro Arsenal are considering a "swoop for Robert Lewandowski" amid reports in Germany that he wants out of Bayern Munich.

Chelsea and Manchester United have already been linked to the Poland international in recent weeks, as were Real Madrid when it was rumoured that Cristiano Ronaldo might be leaving. He's not and with Chelsea closing in on Romelu Lukaku and United chasing Alvaro Morata, the options are running out for the 28-year-old Lewandowski.

But German newspaper Sports Bild claims that the striker has become "a surprise target for an increasingly ambitious Arsene Wenger". The Gunners boss knows he needs to beef up his squad and with the London Evening Standard reporting that Lyon have rejected a £44m bid for Lacazette, it now appears he wants the Bayern marksman.

The former Borussia Dortmund man scored 43 goals in 47 games in all competitions last season but if Wenger does want to sign him it's likely to cost the Frenchman in the region of £50m.

Finally, the Daily Express claims that Hector Bellerin "will push Arsenal into sealing a deal with Barcelona next week". Rumours have been growing in recent weeks that the Spanish defender wanted to return to his homeland, and the club where he learned his trade as a teenager, and according to the Express there has already been "an initial enquiry from Barcelona", which the Gunners rebuffed. But Spanish paper Mundo Deportivo claims Bellerin is now set to intervene with the right-back ready to confront Arsenal officials and "pressure the club to let him go".

Arsenal transfer news: Wenger bids £35m for ‘top target’ Lemar

29 June

Having admitted defeat in his pursuit of Kylian Mbappe, Arsene Wenger has instead turned his attention to his Monaco team-mate Thomas Lemar, reports The Sun.

The paper claims that the midfielder, also comfortable down the flanks, is the Arsenal manager's "top transfer target" and he has tabled a £35m bid for Lemar, having had his initial offer of £30m rejected.

The 21-year-old was courted by Atletico Madrid last summer but The Sun says that Wenger has been tracking Lemar for more than two years. He first tried to sign him in 2015 when he was at Caen but lost out to Monaco, who paid just £4m for Lemar back then. His value has rocketed after he was instrumental in helping Monaco win the French title last season.

In confirming the bid for Lemar, the Daily Telegraph also claims that the Gunners have made an official approach for Lyon frontman Alexandre Lacazette, saying that the north London outfit have tabled an offer of £49m, which is expected to increase to £55m with add-ons.

But according to Sky Sports, Lyon have followed Monaco in kicking the bid into the long grass, although it's not known whether they are merely trying to get the Gunners to up their price.

The reason why Arsenal are desperate to sign Lacazette, says The Guardian, is that Manchester City are "increasingly confident" of landing Alexis Sanchez. The Chilean frontman is eager for a reunion with City boss Pep Guardiola, with whom he worked at Barcelona, plus there's also the little factor of money.

The Guardian says that the 28-year-old Sanchez has been offered around £250,000 a week by the Gunners "but could earn closer to £300,000 at City".

The confusion is causing headaches for Wenger, with the Frenchman "minded against allowing his finest player to leave". But if he doesn't sanction a sale now – and The Guardian says City are willing to pay £50m – then Sanchez will likely leave for nothing on a free transfer when his contract expires next June.

Arsenal transfer news: Riyad Mahrez agrees to £35m switch

27 June

This week could see the saga of Riyad Mahrez reach its conclusion with the Daily Star claiming the the Foxes flier is set to sign for Arsenal "after giving up on Barcelona".

At the start of the summer it had been rumoured that the Catalans were coming for the Algerian winger but they never quite made it to the King Power Stadium and consequently, claims the Star, Mahrez is ready to accept Arsenal's advances.

Apparently new Barca manager Ernesto Valverde wants Marco Verratti ahead of the Leicester wideman and so the four-year contract that has reportedly been offered by the Gunners will now be accepted.

Spanish rag Sport claims that Mahrez "has had enough of waiting" and has authorised his agent to set up the move to the Emirates. The Star says that Mahrez will cost around £35m with Leicester acknowledging that's it better to cash in on him while the going's good despite the fact he signed a lucrative new contract 12 months ago.

Still with Barcelona and according to the Daily Mirror Arsenal will have to do battle with the Spanish giants for the right to sign Pedro Neto.

The 17-year-old sensation is rated as one of the most exciting talents in Portugal having broken into the Braga first team last season. It's thought that Man United boss Jose Mourinho has had his eye on the frontman for a while but the Mirror claims it is Arsenal who moved first and tabled a £13.5m bid, which was rejected by Braga.

They're holding out for a club to trigger the full £17.5m release clause and that club could be Barcelona with Valverde of the opinion that the youngster is already ready for top-flight football. But Arsenal haven't given up on Neto and they're expected to come back with a bigger bid, which in true Gunners style is still likely to be too low.

Teachers, police and nurses are feeling the biggest impact of the Tories' controversial one per cent pay cap on public sector workers, according to a government report.

See related Boris Johnson joins call to end 1% public sector pay cap

According to the Office of Manpower Economics (OME), an average teacher saw their pay fall by £3 an hour in real terms, while police officers experienced a drop of £2 an hour. The wages of nurses have stagnated.

Researchers from the OME, which provides independent research to official pay bodies, examined ten groups that have their wages set by pay review groups and found they had all seen wage decreases or stagnation.

Adjusted for inflation, hourly earnings of UK public sector workers dropped six per cent between 2005 and 2015.

Downing Street has said it would consider potential wage increases on a "case-by-case" basis, after Conservative cabinet members expressed their concern over the pay cap.

While Chancellor Philip Hammond last night urged his party to "hold our nerve" on the issue, his Labour counterpart John McDonnell called for an increase in public sector pay.

"The fact that some of the pillars of our community and the public sector such as teachers, doctors and police officers are seeing their pay cut exposes the double standards of a government that likes to praise their work but will not actually truly reward it," he said.

The Samsung Galaxy S8 has finally arrived, and it’s a major new leap for mobiles.

The handset, available now at John Lewis, shakes up the smartphone status quo with plenty of game-changing updates.

It’s the perfect excuse to finally make that upgrade – here’s what you need to know.

1) It’s got an amazing new screen

Catching up on the latest episode of Silicon Valley on your commute just got even better thanks to the Galaxy S8’s 5.8” Infinity Display. Samsung has ditched the home button found on most mobile handsets, allowing them to fit a huge 2960 x 1440 pixel screen on the S8 without taking up any more space in your pocket.

2) The upgraded cameras offer increased protection

Privacy is important on a gadget that contains so much of your personal information. Security on the S8 has been upped thanks to an iris scanner in the front camera which can unlock the phone.

Tesla Inc's Model S did not get the top score in certain tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), the agency said on Thursday.

Chevrolet Impala, Ford Motor Co's Taurus and Tesla's Model S were the three sedans that got "only an acceptable rating" in a test designed to simulate what happens when the front driver-side corner of a vehicle strikes a tree or another vehicle, the IIHS said.

Ford's Lincoln Continental, the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Toyota Motor Corp's Avalon received the highest rating overall, the agency said.

In the test, the seat belt in Tesla's Model S was not effective and could lead to the driver's head striking the steering wheel hard through the air bag, according to the report.

Tesla's Model S received the highest rating in IIHS's crash testing in every category except one, the small overlap front crash test, where it received the second highest rating available, a Tesla spokesperson said in an email.

"IIHS and dozens of other private industry groups around the world have methods and motivations that suit their own subjective purposes," the spokesperson said.

Tesla said the most objective and accurate independent vehicle safety test is done by the U.S. government, which found Model S and Model X to have the lowest probability of injury of any cars that it has ever tested.

In order to get the top IIHS rating, automakers must have a frontal crash prevention system with automatic braking capabilities to prevent a rear-end collision.

The vehicles must stop or slow down without driver intervention before hitting a target in tests at 12 or 25 miles per hour among other factors, IIHS said.

Toyota said in a statement it is committed to developing safe and reliable vehicles.

General Motors Co declined to comment, while Ford and Mercedes were not immediately available for comment.

The IIHS is a research arm of the insurance industry, and its crash tests are increasingly influential in guiding vehicle safety design. Automakers strive for top ratings in IIHS tests as they do on federal crash tests.

A fierce political debate is raging about whether austerity for the UK, after seven long years, is finally over. But what actually is austerity? Who was responsible for it? What was it for?

Did it actually achieve what it was supposed to achieve? And what were the human costs of the policy?

Finally, should we believe those who say that the end is in sight? Here Ben Chu, the economics editor of The Independent, tackles all those questions.

Fixed-term gas and electricity contracts often include exit fees but Ofgem rules bar companies from charging these during the final 49 days of a contract Andrew Milligan/PA

British Gas is being investigated by the energy regulator over concerns that it may have wrongly told customers they would be charged up to £60 for switching to a different supplier.

Ofgem said that it had opened an investigation into Britain’s biggest energy supplier to examine whether it had breached licence conditions related to charging exit fees. If found to have breached licence conditions it could face a fine.

Fixed-term gas and electricity contracts are typically cheaper than indefinite standard variable tariffs, but often include exit fees that penalise a customer if they switch before the contract term is up.

Ofgem rules bar companies from charging these fees during the final 49 days of a contract, termed the “switching period”, so that they can sign…

I'm no stranger to wild behaviour – but there's one thing that even I wouldn't do, and that's running "with" the bulls in Pamplona, Spain. That can f**k right off.

While there may be guts (from the runners who are gored), there certainly isn't any glory in trying to stay a few steps ahead of frightened, confused bulls. In the lead-up to the event, the animals are held in dark enclosures before being forced out – usually with an electric shock prod – into the jeering, drunken crowd.

As they are momentarily blinded by the sunlight and struggle to take in their surroundings, men hit them with sticks and rolled-up newspapers. The panicked animals take off running down the city's slippery cobblestone streets, often losing their footing and slamming into walls – or spectators – in their desperate attempt to flee the chaos.

This isn't a test of nerve and resolve. It's a pathetic display of human idiocy and cruelty.

Bulls gore spectators and matadors after breaking free during bullfight

At the end of the day, each bull is herded into the city's bullring to fight to the death – except that it'll never be a fair contest. From the moment he enters the ring, he has no chance of winning. As many as eight men spear and stab the exhausted animal to weaken him further.

At this point, he sometimes drowns in his own blood, but if not, the matador finally attempts to kill him with a sword. If the matador's bravado ends in failure, an executioner enters the ring to sever the bull's spine with a dagger. This, too, can be botched, leaving him paralysed but still alive as his wounded, bleeding body is dragged out of the arena.

Then another bull enters, and the horrific process starts all over again. It's truly more twisted than anything I could have imagined, even during my wildest days with Mötley Crüe.

Pamplona's Running of the Bulls

And let's be honest: if people paid to watch a man in a sparkly leotard torment and butcher a dog or cat in this way, we wouldn't dare try to excuse it as "tradition" – we'd declare him a sicko, lock him up, and throw away the key.

Fortunately, most people in Spain don't support bullfighting, and many consider it a national disgrace. It's the tourists who keep the bullfights alive and the bulls dying.

By paying money to run with the bulls or attend bullfights – even out of curiosity or by passively going along with events lined up for them in their travel itinerary – they are supporting cruelty. By the time they rush out of the arena in horror, the damage has already been done.

Fortunately, organisations like PETA and other kind people are working to get these cruel, cowardly spectacles banned across Spain – and they have my support. I hope they have yours, too. Because from music to motocross, we have limitless ways to entertain ourselves that don't involve harassing, torturing or killing animals.

A recent puzzle had a theme which was mis-reported as a printing error. Themes and hidden messages may be more common than you think ...

I’ll be quixotic to avoid spoilers, but today seems quite appropriate for this question: is this a place to discuss quick crosswords?



Take the Times’s concise puzzle, which has been in the news. Devotees of that puzzle will have noticed, over time, that it is now never merely a set of definitions. One day, you might spot that some of the rows of the completed grid contain two-word phrases. Another day, perhaps, there are some symmetrically arranged Ks – as has happened in that paper and elsewhere.

Every so often, the theme is more explicit. Here’s a selection of down clues from Times2 Concise 7,358, published last month:



1. Large cat (5)

3. Cat (4)

6. Large cat (7)

7. Large cat (7)

12. Large cat (7)

13. Cat (7)

19. Cross between 21 down and 1 down (5)

21. Large cat (4)

And here’s the peculiar thing. The more obvious a setter makes his or her special feature, the more likely it is to be mistaken, not for a feature, but for a bug. The Mirror reported on the puzzle like this:

Clearly there was a malfunction in the printing of yesterday’s Times crossword, because it had many more people than usual scratching their heads.

Imagine how much head-scratching would be caused by the revelation that every single day, the Times’s second section publishes a puzzle with just such an “error”, some of them disguised with Bletchley-like levels of ingenuity (incidentally, the crosswords-in-D-Day story has reappeared this week in the Washington Post).

I’ve yet to work out when this Times tradition began: there is a long period in which, as far as I can see, there are no hidden extras, and a transition phase when special tricks appeared now and again. If you have any intelligence on this, please do share.



Because for me, the answer to the question at the top is: yes. If a quick crossword tries out tricks where, say, all the four-letter answers are anagrams of each other, that is surely wordplay. And if the wordplay might help the solver to get some answers where the definitional clues have not provided clarity, then you’re really talking about cryptic crosswording in disguise.

Over to you.

David Beckham has defended kissing his daughter Harper on the lips – after a photo of the pair sparked a debate about boundaries in parenting.

The veteran football star posted a photograph of him kissing his five-year-old daughter on a beach last month, but some of his followers responded by calling it “inappropriate”.

But in a discussion on Facebook Live, Beckham insisted he is “very affectionate” with his kids because that is how he was brought up.

He said: “I got actually criticised for kissing my daughter on the lips the other day. I kiss all my kids on the lips.

Kiss for Daddy ❤️ A post shared by David Beckham (@davidbeckham) on Jun 1, 2017 at 10:55am PDT

“Brooklyn, maybe not. Brooklyn’s 18, he might find that a little bit strange. But I’m very affectionate with the kids. It’s how I was brought up and Victoria, and it’s how we are with our children.

“We want to show our kids love and we protect them, look after them, and support them, and we’re very affectionate with them.”

One doctor previously provoked anger after suggesting that parents should not kiss their child on the lips because it could be “confusing”.

Dr Charlotte Reznick, a child and educational psychologist at Californian university UCLA, said: “If you start kissing your kids on the lips, when do you stop? It gets very confusing.”

Happy Birthday baby girl 🙏🏻💕 We all love you so much 💜💜💜 X @davidbeckham @brooklynbeckham kisses from mummy X A post shared by Victoria Beckham (@victoriabeckham) on Jul 10, 2016 at 1:27am PDT

But child psychologist Dr Fiona Martin disagreed, saying: “It’s beautiful. Anything that promotes emotional connectivity is good. It’s certainly not inappropriate to kiss your child.”

Beckham’s initial post appeared on his Instagram account, on which he had 38 million followers. It was captioned with the words: “Kiss for daddy”, alongside a heart emoji.

It received 2 million likes, but some of the comments included: “David, to kiss lips of your daughter that’s wrong,” and “to be honest kissing your daughter on the lips is a little weird.”

But other fans sprung to his defence, with one writing: “A father having a bond with his child is nothing less than beautiful.” His wife Victoria was the subject of a similar debate in July last year, when she posted a photo of her kissing Harper on the lips in a pool.

The idea of a ‘big marriage’ to tackle issues such as North Korea is dead and what might come from their G20 meeting is unknown, but it will be tense

“Occasionally, yes, toughness does involve some old-fashioned ass-kicking,” Donald Trump mused in “Surviving at the Top”.



In his dealings with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, though, the US president has until recently preferred to kiss.

“He is a very good man ... he loves China and he loves the people of China,” Trump fawned after their first date in April at his Mar-a-Lago estate.



In another interview he boasted: “I really liked him a lot. I think he liked me. We have a great chemistry together.”



But as the pair prepare for their second tête-à-tête on the sidelines of the G20 in Hamburg this week, the passion appears to be fading. “So much for China working with us – but we had to give it a try!” Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning before setting off for Europe on Air Force One.

Experts warn that, after a brief and unusual honeymoon, relations between the world’s top two economies are veering towards the rocks after Xi and Trump failed to find common ground over how to rein in North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.



Kim’s test of an intercontinental ballistic missile aimed at the “American bastards” this week did nothing to improve the atmosphere between Washington and Beijing.

Björn Conrad, the vice president of Berlin’s Mercator Institute for China Studies, said that on reaching the White House Trump had shelved campaign promises to confront Beijing over what he termed its “rapacious” trade practices. He did so in the hope Xi would help him thwart Pyongyang’s nuclear ambitions.

Beijing, however, had been unwilling to forge such an alliance, meaning the risk of a full-blown US-China trade conflict was now back. “Now the focus of the Trump administration shifts once more – and China is back in the cross-hairs,” Conrad said.



Zhu Feng, the director of Nanjing University’s institute of international studies, agreed ties were entering “a new phase of uncertainty”: “The future of US-China relations is worrying.”



Trump’s shock election fuelled fears of a clash between the world’s top two economies. On the stump and in print, Trump had spent years denigrating Beijing, particularly over the damage he alleged it had inflicted on the US economy.

“There are people who wish I wouldn’t refer to China as our enemy. But that’s exactly what they are,” he wrote in his campaign manifesto, Great Again. When one of Trump’s first post-election acts was to thumb his nose at Beijing by fielding a call from Taiwan’s president those fears intensified.



Chinese New Year, however, appeared to herald a new dawn. In February, Ivanka Trump made a peacemaking visit to the Chinese embassy in Washington. Her husband, Jared Kushner, emerged as a key intermediary between his billionaire father-in-law and China’s top leadership. Two months later, Xi and Trump finally met at Mar-a-Lago, and the US president’s rhetoric pivoted immediately from insults to unbridled affection. “I think in the long term were going to have a very, very great relationship,” Trump gushed, heaping praise on Xi and his “incredibly talented wife”.



In recent weeks, however, the tone has soured, amid signs Trump is losing faith in Xi’s willingness to act on North Korea. In late June he vented his frustrations on Twitter: “While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried.”



Then he bared his teeth. Last week Washington unveiled sanctions against a Chinese bank linked to North Korea, announced a major arms sale to Taiwan and sailed a warship close to a disputed island in the South China Sea - moves experts described as unmistakable snubs designed to convey US dissatisfaction with Xi’s regime.

During a phone call on Monday, Xi warned his US counterpart of “negative factors” that were creeping into what Trump had termed their “great relationship”.



Asked if the Xi-Trump bromance was really over, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry replied tetchily: “The ‘honeymoon period’ between China and the United States ... is an interpretation of the media. Officials from both the United States and China ... have not employed this expression.”

Orville Schell, the director of the Centre on US-China Relations at New York’s Asia Society, said Trump’s effusive courtship of Xi had been part of a genuine bid to propose “a big marriage” that would have seen the two powers confront North Korea together.



But the US president considered China’s response to his advances – which included halting imports of North Korean coal – inadequate, “so now Trump is starting to drift away and to turn up the heat”.

“I think Xi has missed a great opportunity, actually,” Schell said. “Had he buddied up with Trump and put the screws on North Korea I think he would have gained immensely in other realms like trade, the South China Sea, the East China Sea. But it seems he is not willing or able to really declare himself married to the US and Trump on the question of North Korea.”

Conrad said Trump had hoped that by teaming up with Beijing on North Korea he could achieve “a quick and very visible foreign policy win”. “And then it turns out - as it always does - that reality is just much more complicated than that.”

“I wouldn’t say it was a mistake [for Xi] not to take that offer in exchange for peace on the trade front,” he added. “I don’t think there was real space [for a deal].”

On the eve of their G20 meeting, Trump has hinted his proposal to the Communist party chief still stands. “Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!” he tweeted on Tuesday after Pyongyang’s latest missile test.



Schell predicted Trump would make one final pass at China’s leader in Hamburg: “I think this is the last flight out for Xi.” But it was an offer Xi was likely to decline. “They are such a deeply conservative regime that they have a very difficult time imagining real paradigm shifts and really perceiving how the world has changed and where new convergences of common interests actually lie, à la Kissinger.”

Conrad said the question now was how destructive the fall-out would be. “There will be tensions over trade with China - this is almost certain. But there are still different ways for this to play out,” he said.



Conrad said the best case scenario was a “subtle” trade dispute that stayed within the realms of World Trade Organisation rules. The worst: provocative and blatantly protectionist steps from Trump that thrust both sides into “full-blown trade war mode”.



After months of simpering, “some old-fashioned ass-kicking” may be back on the cards.

Jack Shepherd: OK, so, what the hell is Love Island?

Christopher Hooton: This isn't actually easy to answer. It's essentially Big Brother - with contestants being slowly voted out of a house (in this case, a Mallorcan villa) by the public and the last pair standing winning £50,000 - only the road to victory is paved with Machiavellian gossiping and condom wrappers. Ostensibly, the ITV2 show is about finding love, but going far in it seems to require successfully walking the tightrope of being honourable without being boring.

I should also note it's quite meta in the sense that the rules literally don't matter and are changed at the producers' whim. It's a complex beast, Jack.

Right. I’m kinda with you. From the outside, it just looks like dozens of swole lads trying to out-alpha male each other in order to "bang". And if I wanted to see that I could just go to Infernos.

True, and wouldn't it be great/sociologically interesting if they televised Infernos?! Like that Fried Chicken Shop show. I guess the appeal is kind of 'people watching' but within this really weird, shiny ITV2 artifice. I swear I've learned more about human beings and how they interact and treat each other from Love Island than a lot of recent scripted shows. I'm plundering the depths of humanity here. This is important research.

Then why hasn’t Big Brother taken off again? That was another example of ‘people watching’ and Love Island just seems like a facsimile, albeit it a more crass one. Frankly, it seems like Love Island only has an edge because of the nudity; or perhaps we just go through reality TV show fads?

I think it's partly down to how bleak the global situation is right now - I actually wrote about this the other day - people need a distraction, something mindless and inconsequential, more than ever. But yes, also it has lots of butts and they're always at a premium on TV.

Yeah, I get that it’s a distraction, and there’s not exactly much joyful TV right now. But I just don’t understand how Love Island has elevated itself above other trash TV shows, to the point where publications who don't normally touch these shows (including this one) are writing about them. What makes Love Island special?

The producers. Big Brother et al were all about rules, to the point where good TV/good contestants would be allowed to fall in accordance with them. If Love Island knows a contestant is good value they'll switch the voting procedure up so it's more likely they'll stay on the island. If everyone is too coupled up and being dull, they'll put the men in a separate house, flood it with women, tell them 'what happens on tour stays on tour' but then feed back photos of them 'cracking on' (to use Love Island parlance) back to their other halves in the main house (this literally happened the other day). They don't draw the line anywhere. They're playing God.

Sounds like there are some seriously weird complexes going on here; I am intrigued. Let’s say, then, I did want to try this thing out, am I too late?

Nope! It's only two-thirds of the way through and the show's actually been extended by a week it's so popular (viewers are well into the millions, which is big for ITV2). I'm suddenly hesitant to recommend it though, it'll take over your life like it has mine. Jesus, I'll never get round to The Handmaid's Tale.

Okay, I’ll give it a go. But, much like the fidget spinner, I may never truly understand the hype.

Thank you and, I think, I'm sorry.

Those of us soul-searching for reasons Donald Trump has been able to erase Hillary Clinton's formidable mid-summer lead have homed in on several plausible explanations, from media failures to Clinton's health scare. What has largely escaped serious consideration is the fact that Trump, as a candidate, has improved.

The Republican nominee hasn't improved in the sense that he suddenly stands for good ideas or has boned up on policy in any serious way. But if Trump's campaign bottomed out when he mocked the Muslim immigrant family of a dead Iraq war soldier, it is now clearly less erratic. As odious as they may be in their views and public roles, his new top aides, Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway, have brought at least some measure of discipline to the most id-driven candidate in living memory. Trump now reserves his ire for journalists and news outlets rather than Gold Star families. He's even found it within himself to express sympathy with victims of police shootings and grudgingly admit that Barack Obama was born in America.

If unfavorable news coverage drove Clinton's numbers downward, Trump's modicum of discipline might partly explain why his numbers have crept up between mid-August and today. Granted, he has cleared a bar of professionalism so low it could be confused for a tree root. But because much less of what he says now is gut-level extemporaneous pandering, Trump has also compelled us to treat his pronouncements with more seriousness. And the unsurprising picture that has emerged is of a considered, coherent and horrifying program of white supremacy.

This week, Trump has floated a vast punitive policy regime that would mostly leave white communities untouched.

In multiple comments on Wednesday and Thursday, he called for the revival and expansion of stop-and-frisk policing quotas, which amount to government-mandated profiling and harassment of inner-city black men.

"They'll stop, they'll frisk and they'll take the gun away, and they won't have anything to shoot with," Trump explained on Fox News. That Trump proposed this during what has been described as a campaign of "outreach" to black voters is almost as jarring as the breeziness with which Trump -- who falsely accuses Clinton of wanting to repeal the Second Amendment -- advocates taking guns away from black people. The single explanation for both contradictions is that Trump is championing, as a safety measure for black communities, a policy that whites want to impose for their own sense of security.

Also this week, Trump admitted that he wants to ban Muslims and Syrian refugees from entering the United States, not just as a dubious security measure, but as "a matter of quality of life." In a similar vein, he has proposed stripping U.S. citizens suspected of jihadi terrorism of their due process rights, an idea that echoes in alarming fashion his past praise of Saddam Hussein as an efficient extra-judicial terrorist killer. He extended this pattern to non-security issues in promising that under his administration, the country will be rebuilt with "American hands ... not the hands of people from other countries."

In examining why Jewish conservatives have largely fled the GOP this cycle, Jonathan Chait recently wrote: "The whiff of Herrenvolk democracy ... is an especially frightening phenomenon to those who suspect they're not included among the Volk." It's more frightening still when even the vestiges of democracy turn out to be negotiable: All of Trump's above ideas, after all, are likely or clearly unconstitutional.

He envisions an America in which a variety of legal rights don't apply to millions of minorities -- a regime constructed for the enrichment and safeguarding of white people, where the principle of equal protection is eroded into meaninglessness.

And this, supposedly, is Trump at his most docile and controlled -- proposing the imposition of a white ethnocracy.

Children of Russian oligarchs are expected to celebrate weddings in the most extravagant methods possible and the latest celebration did not disappoint.

Lolita Osmanova chose LA’s iconic Dolby Theatre - where the Oscars take place - as the venue for her wedding to Gaspar Avdolyan, that cost a total of $10m (£7.7m).

No expense was spared on the extravagant occasion and Lady Gaga and Jason Derulo were flown in to perform. The wedding celebration included a ten-tier golden cake and the flowers alone are believed to have cost a total of $500,000 (£386,000), according to Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.

Lolita Osmanova is the daughter of tycoon Eldar Osmanov, owner of the energy sales company Mezhregionsoyenergo. Albert Avdolyan, a Russian telecommunications magnate is the father of her husband Gaspar, and is among Russia’s richest businessmen with capital of $750m (£580m) according to Forbes.





Wedding guests were greeted by several rows of classic violinists, a symphony orchestra and a ballet performance.

Lolita, 22, wore a dramatic floor-length gown designed by Zuhair Murad, with resplendent jewels and intricate lace. Opulent flower arrangements adorned the gold aisle and every table had centrepiece displays of red roses.

Jager-bombs, snake-bites and cheap squash mixed with vodka are fine to neck when you’re an undergrad and your dignity matters less than getting wasted.

But as you reach your thirties, and surpass that milestone, you’ll find that people also posing as adults will come to your home, and for some reason they won’t want to drink bottom-shelf cider from a novelty mug. Just a heads up, they’ll probably also expect wine glasses.

Oh and, from experience, picking up some plastic picnicware in Tesco an hour before people in their 30s come round is not acceptable and is not conducive to looking like you have your life together. Sorry...

Thankfully, help is at hand as top bartenders have run down the drinks that a person should get to grips with before they turn 30, or need to learn sharpish if they’ve already hit that age.

An Old Fashioned

This drink combines 50ml whiskey or brandy, 1 teaspoon of sugar and two or three dashes of angostura bitters and citrus rind. “It's simple yet sophisticated classic cocktail that you’ll drink for the rest of your life,” says Peter Tunney of London’s European Bartender School. “All you need is a good bottle of bourbon and a few condiments to make it but it serves as the perfect remedy for pretty much anything."

Mojito

"There are a handful of cocktails everyone should know how to make before they turn 30 but nothing says ‘at home cocktail aficionado’ than a well-made Mojito," suggests Be At One Brand Ambassador, Ricardas Znamenskas.

“To make the perfect Mojito, simply add mint sprigs to a long glass and press lightly with a muddler to release the flavour. Half-fill a tall glass with crushed ice before adding rum, lime juice, lemon juice and sugar syrup. Churn the mixture with a spoon before topping with soda water and capping with more crushed ice. Served with a sprig of mint and a straw, the added attention to detail will make it an instant talking point."

“What’s more, the Mojito is also a great drink when catering for those not wanting alcohol – simply miss out the alcohol for a delicious non-alcoholic version," adds Znamenskas.

The Milanese G&T

This cocktail is an Italian take on a British classic with the amazing flavour of Campari, according to Joe St Clair Ford of member’s club Disrepute in Soho, London. "People are trying to be experimental with how they enjoy their gin. A great alternative to the classic gin and tonic is the Milanese G&T." To whip up this cocktail take one part gin, one part Campari, top up with tonic water to taste and add twist of lemon or a wedge of lime.

Berlin Sour

David Cole, the drinks development manager for Roc & Rye opening in Manchester this summer calls this a "surprisingly delicious sour drink". The Berlin Sour is made using 50ml kummel, 25ml lemon juice and 10ml maraschino. The mixture is then shaken and strained and garnished with a cocktail cherry at the bottom of the glass. "The kummel offers a strong caraway backbone, which is softened by the sweet acidity of lemon and the dryness of maraschino. If you love daiquiris, give this a try – you won’t be disappointed,” says Cole.

Greenpoint

“A sweet herbaceous riff on the better-known Manhattan cocktail,” says Cole. “The peppery rye whiskey and smooth sweet vermouth remain, but the addition of chartreuse makes this slightly punchier. One sip warms you up and makes you feel like it’s probably doing you some good... It’s delectably quaffable, either way." To make a Greenpoint, take 50ml whiskey, 15ml sweet vermouth, 10ml yellow chartreuse, and two dashes Angostura bitters. Stir, and strain into a martini glass. Twist an orange zest over the drink and discard

Negroni

“Before you turn 30, learn to make a Negroni,” advises, bar manage at Craft London, Dave Brosnan. “It’s not just ‘cool’ right now, it’s a brilliant drink. It’s also easy, equal parts of Campari, Gin, and Vermouth, all stirred over ice. If you want to impress, experiment changing the Campari for other Italian amari like Cynar, a bittersweet amaro made from artichokes.

“At Craft London we took this a step further with the Cutty Sark, exchanging the vermouth for a mix of lemon juice and raspberry tea syrup. It’s a complex and vibrant drink that still has its roots firmly grounded in the traditional Negroni recipe.”

Bamboo

"This is a delightfully delicate drink, which is also lower in alcohol content than most," says Cole. "The mixture of sherry and vermouths ensure that it is dry enough to be more-ish, whilst the triple sec brings in a hint of citrusy sweetness. You could drink these over, and over, and over, and over,” says Cole. To create a Bamboo, take 40ml of sherry, 20ml sweet vermouth, 10ml dry vermouth, 5ml triple sec, and two dashes Angostura bitters. Stir, strain into a martini glass and twist an orange zest over the drink.

Charlie Chaplin

The Charlie Chaplin combines 30ml sloe gin, 20ml apricot brandy, and 25ml lime juice, with a twist of the zest of a lemon over the drink. "The bitter-sweet sloes and sweetened apricot are harmonised by the sharp lime juice," says Cole. "It's an easy-drinking sipper that gives you a warm hug from the off. It’s also a great way to use up that sloe gin that you have left over from last Christmas (or possibly the one before that…)."

Bramble

“The Bramble is a modern-masterpiece crafted by legendary English bartender, Dick Bradsell. It’s the perfect cocktail to serve on a scorching hot summer day,” says Tunney. A Bramble features a mix of dry gin, lemon juice, sugar syrup and crème de mûre.

Leftist protesters vow to disrupt G20 summit in Hamburg

HAMBURG "Welcome to Hell". That's the greeting for U.S. President Donald Trump and other world leaders from anti-capitalist protesters in Hamburg, who have vowed to disrupt the G20 summit in the German port city.

Tinkers Bubble will stay lodged in my memory for ever. When I recall it, I can smell the grass. It’s unique among low-impact, ecological communities around the UK in being almost entirely free of fossil fuel. They occasionally use paraffin lamps in winter, but all the work they do, they do manually. Haymaking takes place over a couple of days in June or July. I was spending a week there, volunteering and taking photographs, so I joined in.

We got up early each day, at about 4.30am, and worked until about 12, when we’d stop for lunch under a tree: bread, cheese, some cider. It is a beautiful bit of countryside, about a 20-minute walk from the nearest village, Stoke-sub-Hamdon in Somerset. And it was amazing to work in that ancient way, scything, using a pitchfork to turn the hay. You pick up a bundle and turn it in the air and watch it fall down. What made it really special was that we were doing it for Samson, the shire horse in the picture – it was all for his winter feed.

This photograph was taken on the second day, shortly after lunch. A strap on Samson’s harness broke and everyone had to stop. I went to sit under a tree, and when I looked over, I saw this timeless scene, which seemed to capture not just that moment but the culmination of the whole two days, and everything about life in the community. It’s one of only two handheld shots in my series. Immediate, and backlit to some extent, but with a beautiful light.

A trip to Glastonbury festival in 1994 first sparked my interest in this type of community. Some people were demonstrating how to build a bender – an eco-dwelling made of hazel-wood poles, bent and tied and covered with canvas. The structures we build and the communities they embody have always been a way of understanding the world, and these benders stuck with me. In 2004, I decided to record communities around the country living in these and other kinds of low-impact structures. Tinkers Bubble was the second I found – they’d been going for a decade already when I met them. It sounds like a fairytale name, but it’s the local name of a stream on the land where tinkers used to water their horses.

Scything is hard labour. Living this way is very hard – it takes a person with a good set of skills. And the community has fought hard to do what they do, with their appeals for planning permission going all the way to the High Court. In the 90s, the government decided their subsistence farming wasn’t a practical pattern of land use: it was not sustainable in any wider national sense that other people could live like this. But after the Conservatives lost the election, in 1997, the community reapplied. In 1999, they got permission to continue for five years. This permission has since been renewed and extended but it still remains temporary.

The beauty of the scene captured here is countered by the weight of the politics. But it also represents this idea of a simpler life. Like Henry David Thoreau spending a couple of years in his hut at Walden Pond, it taps into a desire to figure out what you truly need in life. At Tinkers Bubble, when someone is poorly, everyone helps. They eat communally every day, taking turns to cook.

Samson died a few years after this photograph was taken, and is buried on the grounds. He was a great horse – it took the community a long while to find another. Horses are central to everything they do, from the communal logging business to pub outings. There is another shot, of everyone coming back from their local, where we’d gone for a drink. There’s something very special about going to the pub in a horse-driven cart, tying him up on the street outside and sitting in the garden so we can keep an eye on him.



Life inside Tinkers Bubble is refreshing, and I remember how amazed I was on my first visit. I parked my car and walked up a path through an orchard, past Samson grazing in his field, climbed over a solar-powered electric fence, walked past allotments and polytunnels, solar panels and a wind generator and then up a steep hill that got steeper. At the top, sheltered from view under a canopy of Douglas fir, were a handful of dwellings arranged around the communal roundhouse. Each first visit I made to a community was wonderful. I felt as if I’d arrived in a parallel reality. I couldn’t believe that, in 21st-century, Britain people were living like this.

WASHINGTON—North Korea’s provocative July 4 test of an intercontinental ballistic missile comes as the Trump administration faces an uncomfortable reality: Any use of force against North Korea carries the risk of a catastrophic war and could still fail to stop the regime from wielding a nuclear arsenal.

A recent review of the issue at the White House provided American officials with possible options on North Korea, including the outside possibility of using force against the regime or its nuclear facilities with the aim...

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley says, ''If we act together we can still prevent a catastrophe and we can rid the world of a grave threat,'' in response to Pyongyang's recent intercontinental ballistic missile launch. Rough Cut (no reporter narration).

ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) STORY: U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Wednesday (July 5) that North Korea's actions were "quickly closing off the possibility of a diplomatic solution" and the United States was prepared to defend itself and its allies. "One of our capabilities lies with our considerable military forces. We will use them if we must, but we prefer not to have to go in that direction," Haley told a U.N. Security Council meeting on Pyongyang's recent intercontinental ballistic missile launch. She said the United States would propose new U.N. sanctions on North Korea "in the coming days." She also warned that Washington was prepared to cut off trade with countries trading with North Korea in violation of U.N. resolutions.

With new Monarch flights starting from Luton, Birmingham and Manchester, it's easier than ever to reach Porto. The home of port wine, Portugal's enchanting second city also offers a winning blend of austere architecture and cutting-edge design, plus buzzy bars and beaches, just up the Douro river.

What to see

Porto is bursting with beautiful structures: blue-tiled churches here, Eiffel-designed bridges there. Be sure to gasp at twin-towered Se do Porto cathedral – and climb to its mesmerising miradouro (lookout) – and nearby Sao Bento station's blue-and-white azulejo tiles. Then, for more modern kicks, admire Casa da Musica, a concert hall hewn from stark white concrete, and the Serralves, Portugal's finest contemporary art museum.

Image 2 of 4 Description Casa da Musica

Take some time out

On the Douro's southern shore is Vila Nova de Gaia (aka Gaia) and the original old port lodges of companies like Cockburn's and Croft. Tasting and walking tours are available, but for slicker sampling cross back over the river to Vinologia, whose port flights are as heavenly as they are educative. Don't swallow? Fat chance.

Where to shop

A glut of design-focused, multipurpose spaces have materalised in recent years, most hawking desirable handmade products. Lobo Taste and Scar.ID are two such, while newly arrived Armazem is an old wine warehouse turned cafe, gallery and shops, selling everything from vintage clocks to chic handbags.

Image 3 of 4 Description Serralves

Where to eat

Petiscos (Portuguese tapas) are available in most bars and restaurants, but the classic snack is something saltier. 'Being so near to the sea, Porto is famous for its fish,' says Margarida Ribeiro, an editor of gastro website Porto Tasty. 'I suggest Taverna do Sao Pedro: it's a very traditional seafood restaurant that few tourists know.'

Where to drink

A bookstore focused on art and cinema by day, Candelabro transforms into a smoky bar after-dark, although many guests congregate on the pavement just outside. It's the kind of place that is effortlessly but unpretentiously hip: everyone's friendly and welcoming. Bottles of Super Bock beer cost only a few euros and DJs play late on weekends.

Image 4 of 4 Description View from the Tree Garden at The Yeatman

Where to stay

Porto's chicest residents clink pink port and tonics at The Yeatman's suntrap rooftop, set on a hillside above the city. Inside, this five-star hotel affords its guests an extensive spa, an equally extensive wine cellar and fine dining.

Donald Trump begins his second foreign foray as US President today with a stop-off in Poland before heading to the G20 summit in Germany on Friday. Trump’s trip comes at a time of troubles for him, internationally, with publics in many countries already having less confidence in him than George W Bush at the height of his own travails as president.

Given Trump’s unpopularity is particularly marked in Western Europe, it is no coincidence that he has decided to make a Polish stop-off where Washington recently deployed hundreds of troops. The country’s government, run by the conservative, Eurosceptic Law and Justice Party, has been much more welcoming of Trump than many other EU counterparts, and the country is one of only four NATO members other than the United States that spends the 2 per cent target of GDP on defence.

Examples of the Polish administration’s affinity with Trump include its opposition to immigration, support for burning coal, and scepticism of multilateral institutions. Right now, for instance, Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo finds herself in heated battles with the EU over her administration’s refusal to resettle refugees and migrants, and opposition to judicial changes that Brussels says will weaken the rule of law.

Recalling former US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld’s controversial division between so-called “Old Europe” in the west of the continent and “New Europe” in the east, Trump will also attend the Three Seas initiative. This is a conference in Wroclaw for leaders from 12 Central European, Baltic and Western Balkan states.

MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski responds to Donald Trump's attack

Yet, despite the warm reception the US president will receive in Poland, he is likely to find himself in a significant foreign policy disagreement even here. That is because many in the country are concerned about Russia’s resurgence, especially given Trump’s previous scepticism of NATO and his occasionally warm rhetoric toward Vladimir Putin.

However, the trip’s overall theme will be US-Polish solidarity and this will bolster Trump before the G20 which could be a significantly rougher ride for him. Criticism he could receive at that German summit stems from his “America First” philosophy, including his controversial withdrawal from the Paris climate change deal; his pledge to build a “Mexican wall”; plus his temporary travel ban for six Muslim-majority countries.

The latest evidence of the extent of international disdain for Trump is found in a major report last week from Pew Global Research. Remarkably, this found that around three quarters of the world has little or no confidence in his international leadership and policies. Indeed, in many countries, support for the President is lower than that for Bush in 2004 after the controversial US-led invasion of Iraq.

To be sure, at least two significant countries – Israel and Russia – have much higher faith in Trump and his international leadership. But these are very much the exceptions in a sea of international negativity toward him from Asia-Pacific to the Americas.

As last week’s Pew data revealed, the spike in anti-US sentiment in many countries for the first time since Bush’s presidency means Trump now has potential to become the least popular ever US president overseas in modern history. And this could undercut much of the work that Barack Obama undertook to turn around the climate of perception about the country in the last eight years.

Covfefe, Meryl Streep and North Korea - Trump's most controversial tweets

Coming into office in 2009, Obama confronted a situation in which anti-US sentiment was at about its highest levels since at least the Vietnam War. The key factor driving this was the international unpopularity of the Bush administration’s foreign policies in the so-called “war on terror”.

The Obama team did much to reverse these public opinion patterns. And according to one research study, by Anholt-GfK Roper Nation Brands Index, which uses the same tools that consultants use to value corporate brands, the “Obama effect” was estimated to have raised the value of “Brand America” by $2.1 trillion in the first year of his presidency alone.

This reflected the substantial increase in foreigners regarding the United States as the most admired country in the world again following the Bush presidency. And this turnaround in fortunes was not only been welcomed in Washington but also in corporate America, following concerns during the Bush years that US-headquartered multinationals were becoming a focus for a commercial backlash because of anti-Americanism.

However, despite successes, Obama’s progress was uneven. Perhaps the biggest failure of his global public diplomacy was toward what he called the Islamic world.

For instance, despite the early promise of his Cairo speech in his first term in which he sought to reset US relations with Muslim-majority countries, there remain pockets of very high anti-Americanism in several key states. This includes in countries like Pakistan and Egypt which Obama failed to substantially address, as surveys have shown over recent years.

Yet, despite this, more than 64 per cent of global publics overall had trust in Obama’s international leadership in the final year of his presidency: far cry from the situation for Trump today.

Indeed, it is crystal clear that much of the world still wishes that Hillary Clinton was elected last November. Although she lost last year’s US election, she was the stand-out winner in last year’s poll of nearly 50,000 people in 45 countries, covering 75 per cent of the world, by WIN/ Gallup International Association. The survey found that the public in all but one country (Russia) wanted Clinton to win over Trump.

And the WIN/Gallup poll results were very similar to that by Handelsblatt last year that was taken with some 20,000 people in the G20. Once again, Russia was the only state where Trump bested Clinton.

Taken overall, the Polish trip will be welcome respite for Trump given growing international disdain for him. As polls indicate, he may become the least popular US president overseas in modern history, undermining his potential for foreign policy success in coming years.

Um Jad holds her daughter Suha, 2, in the refugee camp where they live, having fled Mosul. Hundreds of children have been left shellshocked by their time in the city under Islamic State, Save the Children says Ahma Baroudi/Save the Children/Press Association

When a bullet from an Islamic State sniper killed her brother, Sara, 11, passed out in shock. “I felt my soul squeezed so hard,” she says, recalling how his body lay for a day outside their home in Mosul.

The trauma did not end with losing a sibling. Sara is one of thousands of Iraqi children who have been psychologically scarred by the brutal fight to retake Mosul from Isis.

They need urgent psychological support lasting years to prevent lifelong damage, according to Save the Children. The charity says there are signs of “toxic stress”, where the mind is constantly in “fight or flight” mode, with some numbed and left “robotic”. About 90 per cent are said to have lost a loved one to violence…

Private not state hackers likely to have targeted UK parliament - sources

The capital city of Africa’s most populous country is to be cut off by air for six weeks because of runway repairs — with the recommended alternative airport in territory on the Foreign Office no-go list.

The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria has announced that Abuja airport will close between 7 March and 19 April 2017.

During the closure, airlines have been invited to land and take off at Kaduna airport, 100 miles north of the capital. But the latest travel advice from the Foreign Office shows that this airport is deep inside "no-go" territory. The FCO warns of the risk of “significant attacks” in Kaduna state, with the city itself “particularly at risk”.

The aviation minister, Senator Hadi Sirika, has inaugurated a security sub-committee aimed at keeping passengers safe in transit between Kaduna and Abuja.

But British Airways has announced that it will cancel all its flights to Abuja during the closure.

The airline said: “We have been informed that the runway at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja will be closed for extensive repairs.

“Unfortunately this means that we have to cancel all flights to/from the airport for that period of time."

BA currently has a daily flight to and from Heathrow. The airline is offering passengers a full refund, the chance to alter the flight date, or to fly instead to Lagos or Accra.

It said: “We hope that we can restart our normal flight schedules from Heathrow to Abuja on the evening of 19 April and from Abuja to Heathrow the following morning on 20 April 2017.”

The US State Department says that American officials in Nigeria are allowed to travel to Kaduna only if they ask permission in advance: “US officials and their families must receive advance clearance by the US Mission for any travel to or from Kaduna, Kano, and Port Harcourt, including overland transit to airports outside Abuja.”

Besides British Airways, six other international airlines currently fly to Abuja: Air France, Egyptair, Ethiopian Airlines, Lufthansa, South African Airways and Turkish Airlines.

The White House and a pair of influential conservative advocacy groups have endorsed a proposal by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) that would allow health insurers to offer cheaper, less-comprehensive plans as long as they also offered at least one plan that includes the essential consumer protections required by the Affordable Care Act. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has sent Cruz's proposal to the Congressional Budget Office for cost-benefit analysis.

Wednesday's endorsement of the Cruz amendment by the leaders of FreedomWorks and the Club for Growth "is significant: Without at least a neutral stance from conservative groups, it could be impossible for McConnell to find the 50 votes needed to pass a repeal this month," Politico reports. "But what the right is asking for may not be able to pass the Senate." The proposal may well violate budget rules that McConnell is using to push through his bill with 51 votes, and more centrist senators and outside insurance experts are concerned that it would essentially price people with pre-existing conditions and other high medical needs out of the insurance market.

"People who have higher health-care needs and need more comprehensive coverage would choose ACA-compliant plans," said Cori Uccello at the American Academy of Actuaries. "People who are healthy now would tend to choose noncompliant plans with really basic benefits. People who want or need more comprehensive coverage could find it out of their reach, because it might become unaffordable." Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who was frequently thanked during July 4 festivities for helping at least slow down the bill, agreed that the Cruz language "would lead to adverse selection in the marketplace," adding: "It would also vitiate the important consumer protection of having a prohibition against annual and lifetime caps" on benefits.

Cruz and his allies argue that the amendment would lower premiums and allow individual consumers to essentially opt out of ObamaCare, but touching the pre-existing condition language may be a deal-breaker for other Republicans. "Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee is speaking against it in caucus lunches and Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska, a staunch conservative, also vocally opposes Lee and Cruz's idea," Politico says. "Many senators believe that the House made a critical error by allowing states to opt out of pre-existing condition protections and are determined not to touch that part of ObamaCare." A Senate vote could come as early as next week. Peter Weber

Questions have been raised about the UK's withdrawal from the London fisheries convention, including whether EU law supersedes UK policy and whether Britain has the capacity to police its own waters.

Environment Secretary Michael Gove announced on Sunday that the UK was "taking back control" of the fishing territory between six and 12 nautical miles from UK coastline, a decision he hailed as an "important moment" for the UK fisheries policy.

However, Michel Barnier, the European Union's chief Brexit negotiator, downplayed Gove's announcement and said EU law supersedes the UK's position.

UK denunciation of London Convention=no change: EU law/Common Fisheries Policy had superseded it. EU 27 interests=my priority for negs — Michel Barnier (@MichelBarnier) July 2, 2017

Others questioned whether the UK has the naval capability to police its own territory. Admiral Lord Alan West, a retired senior officer of the Royal Navy, described the UK plan as "amazingly complacent".

He also warned the country risked becoming a "laughing stock" if it didn't increase the number of vessels needed to police the territory.

The London fisheries convention, signed in 1964, allows vessels from France, Belgium, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands to fish in waters within six to 12 miles from the UK coast.

The EU Common Fisheries Policy allows all European countries access between 12 and 200 nautical miles of the UK, as well as setting quotas, and some argue it may take precedence over UK law.

Turning off the A40 onto the single-track road leading to the sleepy village of South Leigh, deep in the Oxfordshire countryside, there’s an immediate sense of getting away from it all. And that’s what many Londoners and locals looking for a grown-up night away from the kids have been doing since the Artist Residence group of boutique hotels relaunched this thatched-roofed 16th-century limestone inn this year.

This is the fourth hotel for owners Justin and Charlotte Salisbury – and, on the face of it, it’s an anomaly in the group. Launched in 2008, Artist Residence have previously opened in louche, bohemian locations including Brighton, Penzance and a London backstreet near Victoria station. A fifth is due to open in Bristol next year.

The hotel is in the beautiful Oxfordshire countryside (Artist Residence)

But this former farmhouse has history. Formerly known as Mr Stonhill’s Most Individual Mason Arms, previous owner Gerry Stonhill hit the headlines when he was fined for flouting the anti-smoking laws – a maverick stance that may well have helped attract famous fans such as chefs Marco Pierre White and Raymond Blanc.

As soon as you walk through the door you know this is no ordinary country inn. Yes, there’s a flagstoned floor, stone fireplace and bentwood chairs. But there’s also a neon sign in the bar that reads “What Did I Do Last Night”, while the lounge houses a large, mirrored cross studded with fairground lights – both artworks by Brighton-based artist Andy Doig. Meanwhile, Pulp Fiction-inspired artworks by the Connor Brothers pepper the Morris & Co floral-papered walls.

The Artist Residence group has established a reputation for food and drink, particularly in Brighton, and Mr Hanbury's Dining Room will only enhance that. Chef Leon Smith’s Michelin-starred background includes Restaurant Tom Aikens and Wild Honey in London and the Pony & Trap in Bristol, and it’s evident in a tasting plate of nibbles that includes a miniature portion of fish and chips, the cod coated in a crispy and deeply-flavoured sourdough batter.

Rooms are livened up with things like freestanding copper baths (Artist Residence)

There’s nothing fiddly or fancy here, just hugely enjoyable dishes made with carefully prepared ingredients that are so local and seasonal that a rump of lamb comes from the neighbouring field and is served with delicately spicy bhajis made with courgettes from the hotel’s own kitchen garden. If you’re not up for the full three courses (and you really should be, because Smith is a name to watch), then grab a burger with triple-cooked chips from the bar menu. Smith even manages to make a breakfast bowl of house-made granola with yoghurt and fresh fruit a thing of beauty.

Location

The rural, well-to-do village of South Leigh is about 10 miles west of Oxford city centre. With a population of 336, a village hall and a church, you’ll need to travel to nearby Witney for anything approaching nightlife. The nearest train station is Hanborough, a 15-minute taxi ride away, or Charlbury, 25 minutes from the hotel. Oxford, of course, is a beautiful place to visit.

Comfort

The five individually designed en suite rooms are all built into the eaves of the building, so expect sloping ceilings and original beams. I stayed in the Farmhouse Suite, the largest of the five. Given the age of the building, the lack of air conditioning was no surprise but on a sweltering summer night it was disappointing to discover that fans for the rooms were still on order.

Although the super-king bed was roomy and had a comfortable mattress, its ornate, Moroccan-style carved headboard banged against the wall with every fitful change of sleeping position. The high quality Volga linen sheets and duvet cover looked the part but weren’t quite up to scratch, being tough on the skin and not as cooling as you’d think on a June night.

I stayed within the first month of opening and teething problems were apparent. The capsule coffee machine was faulty and flooded the desk; the retro dial phone didn’t work when I tried to call reception for help, and one of the back legs of the attractive antique two-seater sofa collapsed under me. Management’s response was impressive, however, with a well-made latte quickly delivered to my room and the coffee machine and sofa replaced while I was at dinner. I was assured the phone system would be looked at, though it was still faulty when I checked out.

Architectural salvage stylings with reclaimed doors on the wardrobe and bathroom, a repurposed and distressed painted cabinet housing the minibar (stocked with Cotswolds lager, cider and gin, Bensons soft drinks and Fever-Tree mixers; a hamper of treats included Mr Trotter’s pork crackling and Rococo chocolates), antique wood-framed mirror and a freestanding copper bath added bags of character. In the bathroom, there was good water pressure in the large rainfall shower as well as organic Bramley bath products.

The three Farmhouse Loft rooms (one of which can be set up as a twin room if required) are smaller but equally attractive with pitched ceilings, lead windows and wooden floorboards and also include super-king beds, rainfall showers, roll-top baths and either armchairs or a sofa. The cosy Rabbit Hole is the smallest room but still has enough space for a king-size bed and compact shower room.

Work is under way to convert outbuildings into ground-floor, accessible and dog-friendly accommodation (including a three-bedroom family cottage) by the end of 2017, and there are plans for “shepherd’s huts” on an adjoining field that will also be used as an events space for proposed beer and live music festivals. If the Salisburys get their way, South Leigh will soon be just as louche and bohemian as all the other Artist Residence locations – and who wouldn’t want that?

ROUGH CUT. NO REPORTER NARRATION. Karl Lagerfeld presented a very Parisian haute couture collection for Chanel on Tuesday (July 4) in that most Parisian of settings - the foot of the Eiffel Tower. Lagerfeld has a history of eye-catching set designs for his runway shows and models have previously weaved through an airport departure lounge, a supermarket and a busy brasserie. This season it was back to basics with a scaled-down reconstruction of the 324-metre high tower as backdrop for unveiling a collection including demure A-line skirts and wide-legged jumpsuits in classic Chanel tweed. Models were crowned with matching bowler-style hats in keeping with the collection's vintage feel, but their low block heels were transparent in a modern twist. Haute couture fashion week is open to an exclusive club of designers who make bespoke collections by hand with Chanel, Dior and Jean-Paul Gaultier among the current members. Another of Lagerfeld's labels, Fendi, is set to close couture fashion week on Wednesday.

Ferrari has released a new entry into the front-engined super GT market to replace 2012's critically acclaimed F12 Berlinetta.

The 812 Superfast houses a 6.5-litre naturally aspirated V12 engine with a power output of 789bhp and 530lb-ft of torque - 49bhp and 20lb-ft more than the F12. That's enough to send the aptly-named car from 0-62mph in 2.9secs and on to a top speed of 211mph.

The engine is paired to a seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox which channels power to the rear axle, while the rear wheels are fitted with the second generation of the company's virtual short wheelbase steering system, helping the car navigate corners more easily than its predecessor.

Ferrari says the 812 Superfast's design has been inspired the carmaker's 1969 365 GTB4, incorporating cues such as the high tail and sloping roofline.

It's the most powerful front-engined road car Ferrari has ever made, but how does it compared to the F12 it replaces? Here's what the critics think.

Design

Ferrari has completely overhauled the underpinnings and aerodynamics of its super GT, meaning it should be considered an all-new car rather than a replacement for 2012's F12, says AutoExpress.

It retains its predecessor's front-engined, rear-wheel drive layout and also gets "a new rear-wheel-steering system" together with "Ferrari's Side Slip Control", which lets drivers slide the car without spinning it.

In addition, there is an "active and passive" aerodynamic system, adds the mag, allowing the 812 Superfast to generate more grip at higher speeds without the negative side-effects of drag.

The design has clearly been derived from the F12, says the Daily Telegraph, although the new car is now "festooned in aerodynamic aids that are effective yet discreet".

"You have to study it carefully to comprehend the extent of the airflow management", the newspaper adds. Onlookers will be able to see small ducts and "passive aerodynamics" that have been incorporated "to produce downforce while reducing lift and turbulence around the high tail".

Buyers can also choose from a new colour called "Rosso Settanta" celebrating the company's 70-year anniversary.

Interior

Inside, the super GT gets a pair of new sports seats that are firm but "clamp you in place" for a perfect view of the car's dashboard, Evo says.

It is packed with leather and carbon fibre and gets Ferrari's multifunctional steering wheel, featuring the Manettino switch used for cycling through different driving modes.

"It's certainly the most liveable car with this kind of performance at any price", says Car.

The 812 Superfast "inherits some of the new dash layout from the Ferrari GTC4 Lusso", with its "twin-screen layout" located either side of the rev-counter giving drivers "the most important info right in front of [them]".

It's also "pleasingly practical", says the mag, with a boot space of around 320-500-litres, "depending on how you configure it".

On the road

Although the 812 Superfast is "groaning in electronic aids" to help drivers cope with its 789bhp, it "remains a chiefly analogue experience" on the road, Car says.

Refinements to its aerodynamic and classic set-up, as well as the abundance of driver aids, means it feels "less nervous than the F12 it replaces". It also "turns in eagerly" and will impress drivers with the speed it carries through corners.

"There is much witchcraft occurring within this chassis," says Top Gear, as the rear-wheel steering helps the car get around bends quickly without the driver feeling the onboard electronics working.

Switching to the softer suspension settings irons out bumps in the road nicely, adds the site, although it is a little firmer than the F12.

It's "simply mighty" on the road, says the Telegraph, praising the front-engined supercar's composure on even the most challenge of road surfaces.

The engine note is equally as impressive, as the newspaper says the V12 motor provides a "perfectly executed blip during downchanges."

Some buyers may want a manual gearbox for a more engaging experience, but the paper says the car's dual-clutch system is so good that most won't need a manual transmission to get their driving kicks.

Verdict

The Superfast's "straight-line performance alone has gone from outrageous to thoroughly ridiculous", says AutoExpress.

Indeed, adds the mag, it's such a drastic improvement that it's difficult to see how the 812 Superfast will ever be superseded.

Evo says it "feels approximately twice as fast" on the road as it does on a race track, but the array of onboard computers will "help you keep your quarter million pound 812 Superfast out of the undergrowth".

It also says the sheer performance of the car means it's difficult to pinpoint a rival offering a similar driving experience "at any price point" in the market.

Autocar agrees, saying there are no rivals in this price range that come close to the Superfast's level of performance and "few feel this comfortable to push hard in".

While it's "less natural" than the front-engined Aston Martin Vanquish, continues the mag, the 812 Superfast offers buyers a better driving experience in almost every area over the British-made GT.

Price and release

The Ferrari 812 Superfast is available to order now, says AutoExpress, with prices starting at £253,004. However, expect that number to rise substantially after a few optional extras are added on.

It's official. Alexandre Lacazette has finally become Arsenal's record signing, joining from Lyon in a deal which the Daily Mail says "could be worth up to £53m" with £7m in add-ons on top of the £46m fee.

Having completed his medical at Arsenal's training centre in Hertfordshire on Tuesday, the Lyon frontman then put pen to paper on Wednesday and signed a five-year deal that makes him the club's record signing, surpassing the £42.5m that Arsenal paid for Mesut Ozil in 2013.

The Mail says that Lacazette will link up with his new teammates for a pre-season tour to Australia and China next week.

Arsene Wenger was cock-a-hoop at the signing, telling the official Arsenal website: "We are very happy to have Alexandre join our group. He has shown over a number of years that he can score goals and that he is a very efficient finisher… he is a guy who is a great addition for us, and someone who will help us challenge at the top level this season."

Lacazette was also chuffed at the prospect of playing in the Europa League next season, declaring himself "delighted and very proud" to have signed for the club. Asked why, he said: "Throughout my childhood, thanks to Thierry Henry and other French players, I always dreamed of playing for this club so today that dream has been fulfilled."

Lacazette also praised the club's past, and their manager, saying of Wenger: "The fact that the manager has been here for a while shows that it is a stable club which I like." And asked if he had a message for those fans, many of whom spent last season demanding the head of their manager, Lacazette said: "I want to give one hundred per cent in every match. I want to show I'm worthy of the shirt. I want to do everything I can to make sure we win titles."

Lacazette's arrival does not seem to have left Alexis Sanchez overly impressed says Metro.

The Gunners hoped the striker's arrival would convince him that Arsenal were serious contenders in the Premier League, but the paper says that the Chilean marksman is now "demanding £400,000-a-week to sign a new contract" and the Gunners have told him where to get off.

Apparently the most they are prepared to pay Sanchez a week is £275,000 and it remains to be seen whether the South American will accept this derisory sum.

Mark Cavendish has withdrawn from the Tour de France after he suffered a fractured shoulder blade in a horrendous crash 200 metres from the finish line on stage four. Cycling’s governing body quickly disqualified the world champion, Peter Sagan, for a dangerous move in the sprint finish in which he appeared to elbow the British rider to the floor.

Cavendish also sustained a heavy cut to his hand and was taken to hospital for x-rays to investigate injuries to the shoulder he damaged in a similar pile-up at the end of the first stage of the Tour in Harrogate in July 2014. In a chaotic finale, the yellow jersey holder, Geraint Thomas, also fell – but to no ill effect.

On Tuesday night it was confirmed that Cavendish’s Tour is over. “I’m obviously massively disappointed to get this news about the fracture,” he said. “I feel I was in a good position to win [the stage] and to lose that and even having to leave the Tour, a race I have built my whole career around, is really sad.”

Cavendish’s sporting director at Dimension Data, Roger Hammond, described the move that led to Sagan’s expulsion as “a flick of the elbow which was completely outrageous”. He added: “No one comes out of it well. This is a sad, sad day for the sport, Sagan is a hero and an idol of mine but a precedent has to be set.”

Sagan was initially relegated to 115th place on the stage – last place in the lead bunch – and received the standard sanction of a 30-second time penalty but the president of the jury, Philippe Marien, said the referees applied a sterner sanction because the world champion “had put several other riders involved in the crash in danger”.

Sagan’s Bora-Hansgrohe team announced they had officially protested about the Slovak’s expulsion. The German team said Sagan “rejected [the claim] to have caused, or in any way intended to cause, the crash of Mark Cavendish”. On Wednesday morning, Sagan appeared to have accepted his fate.

“I can accept the decision but for sure I do not agree with them, because I think I have done nothing wrong,” Sagan said in a statement delivered outside the team hotel.

“It is very bad that Mark fell down, it is important he can recover well, I am sorry for that,” he added. “As you saw it was a crazy sprint, it was not the first one like that or the last one. I wish that Mark recovers well.”

In two crashes in the final kilometres involving about 20 riders, it was Cavendish who came off worst, being the first of three sprinters to hit the deck. He lay prone on the tarmac as the rest of the group passed and crossed the line several minutes after the stage winner, Arnaud Démare. Cavendish was holding his right shoulder, with his skin suit ripped from shoulder to waist, and with heavy bandaging on his right hand.

“I’m going to go and get it checked out,” he said. “I will definitely need stitches in this finger, it’s bleeding a lot. With the shoulder, it might be something to do with a previous injury, it’s sat backwards, so I’m not sure if I’ve done something to the ligament. I’m not a doctor but from the feelings, I’m not optimistic.”

The Guardian understands he hit the road so hard he folded the spider and the chainring of his chainset so that they were pointing backwards. Sagan was one of several riders, including Cavendish, who launched their sprints in the wake of the Norwegian Alexandr Kristoff and were accelerating to full speed with around 250m to go. Cavendish was following Démare through a gap between Sagan and the crowd barriers when the Slovak moved to his right, making contact with the Manxman.

Sagan then lifted his elbow up and Cavendish was forced into the barriers in a split second and fell heavily on his right side. “There was no reason for that elbow,” said Hammond. “As a former professional bike rider I know the way it is done.” The German John Degenkolb, who was close behind, rode over Cavendish’s body and helmet and also fell, while the Briton Ben Swift performed a somersault over Cavendish’s bike as it lay on the ground but later told the Guardian he had no injuries.

“I get on with Peter well; if he came across that’s one thing but I’m not a fan of him putting his elbow in me like that,” Cavendish said. “A crash is a crash but I would just like to know about the elbow. I have a good relationship with Peter but I would like to speak to him about it.”

The world champion apologised to Cavendish afterwards but offered no real explanation. “I didn’t know Mark was behind me, he was coming from the right side and I wanted to take the wheel of Kristoff, I think. I wanted to go on his wheel but Mark was coming pretty fast from the back. I didn’t have time to react to go left, he just came to me and then to the barriers.”

Sagan added: “When I was told after the finish that Mark had crashed, I went straight away to find out how he was doing. We are friends and colleagues in the peloton and crashes like that are never nice. I hope Mark recovers soon.”

Philippe Marien, the head UCI commissaire [race official], said: “Before the Tour de France we warned the sprinters that we would look very closely at every sprint, that is what we did today. It was not an easy decision, but this is the beginning of the Tour and now is the moment to set our boundaries. And that is what we did today. It was not about Sagan, but about the act the rider made. What happens here, it looks like it was on purpose and it almost looks like hitting a person. It’s not about Cavendish and Sagan, it could be anybody, the names won’t matter.”

Better known as a sedate spa town and a still mineral water, Vittel does things when the Tour comes to visit. In 1968 this was the start town for a Tour de Santé, supposedly to relaunch the sport in the wake of Tom Simpson’s death, but which ended in two positive drug tests over the three weeks.

On Tuesday, what should have been a decorous celebration of 10 years in which Vittel has been the ‘eaufficiel’ du Tour, ended in Sagan’s disqualification.

This was a massive event, partly because of Sagan’s profile as the most popular rider in cycling, but also because this was the first time a world champion had been thrown off the race since Laurent Brochard was given his marching orders during the Festina drug scandal of 1998. And it is rare indeed for the race’s referees to decide that any of the plethora of dodgy manoeuvres and dirty tricks that happen in sprints is sufficiently life-threatening to merit expulsion.

The last time such a thing happened was in 2010 when the mild-mannered Australian Mark Renshaw decided to use his head as well as his legs at Bourg les Valence, not once, but several times, while in 1997 the otherwise utterly genteel Belgian Tom Steels was sent home for bunging a bidon at a fellow fast man.

The problem boils down to this: sprinters are usually as pleasant as they come, but the scent of the line causes a red mist to descend. This is part of their makeup, but just occasionally there is an attempt to draw a line. Unfortunately the fast men will be butting up against that line – if that is not an unfortunate choice of words – soon, probably as early as Thursday.

Sagan’s expulsion left the race for the green jersey wide open, and the favourite now will be the Frenchman Demare, who emerged from the chaos here to give France its first bunch sprint stage winner since Jimmy Casper. Demare is the national champion and rides for the national favourite Francaise des Jeux, whose patriotic manager Marc Madiot refuses to sully the tricolour by letting it be daubed with his sponsors’ logos.

France will delight in Demare’s win, which reflected well on his turn of speed and it will follow his quest for the green jersey with bated breath in the next 17 days. If there was a slight false note, it came when he was accused of misbehaviour by fourth-placed Nacer Bouhanni, who alleged he had cut him up in the finale. Then again, nor is Bouhanni a stranger to the referees’ communiques. Where sprinting is concerned, earning the right to throw the first metaphorical stone is a big ask.

On Wednesday, the race gets serious with the finish at La Planche des Belles Filles ski resort in the Vosges mountains north of Belfort. The Tour has finished here twice, in 2012 and 2014, and on each occasion the race leader at the summit – in 2012 Bradley Wiggins, in 2014 Vincenzo Nibali – has worn yellow all the way to Paris, and perhaps more importantly that the finishing order at the summit strongly reflects the eventual standings at the end of the Tour.

In both years, seven of the first 10 finishers on top of the 20% wall that concludes the six-kilometre climb also finished in the first 10 in Paris. The chances are that either Geraint Thomas or his leader Chris Froome will retain the lead for Team Sky, although the Welshman hinted that Team Sky may give free rein to a long-distance escape. In Vittel, Thomas fell in a 15-man pile-up in the final kilometre, while Froome was held up, but did not fall.

That would happen if there are no riders up front who are a threat to Froome in the overall standings, as relinquishing the lead to another team will relieve them of the need to expend energy in defence of the maillot jaune. “I don’t think we will waste a lot of energy to bring back a big break if there is no one dangerous in it, and if it goes to someone who is not a threat overall, it’s not a big deal. If we are all together on the climb Froome is our main goal, so I will do what I can to help him. If he gets the jersey, great, if I keep it, that’s even better.”

Cristiano Ronaldo could be back at Old Trafford next season, claims the Sunday Times, after the Portuguese striker decided to sever all ties with Spain.

The 32-year-old Ronaldo is said to be livid with his treatment in the wake of last week's accusation from Madrid’s regional state prosecutor that he committed "tax fraud of €14,768,897 (£12.9m)". The Real Madrid ace denies all the charges and the paper says that the Portugal international has been "angered and saddened by the claim and the reporting of it in Spain".

Believing he is the target of a vendetta, Ronaldo has informed Real Madrid of his decision to leave and has ordered his representatives "to find him a new club". So might that be United?

According to the Sunday Times, the Red Devils would love to welcome him back eight years after they sold him to Real Madrid for a then world record transfer fee of £80m. The paper says that United are "exploring the viability of buying the 32-year-old back", but they will face stiff competition from Paris Saint-Germain while several Chinese clubs are "ready to substantially improve the terms of his €21m (£18.4m) per annum net salary".

Ronaldo retains a soft spot for United and according to The Sun he has told his agent, Jorge Mendes, "to do everything possible" to facilitate a return to Old Trafford. The paper confirms that PSG are also interested (as well as Bayern Munich) and says that the French club are "prepared to offer £122m to land him plus a staggering salary of £26m per year".

Metro throws a fresh angle on the story with its claim that Ronaldo in fact told Alex Ferguson of his intention to leave Real before the tax fraud accusations. The pair keep in contact and Metro says that Ronaldo has become disenchanted with life in Madrid because of the "negative reaction" he receives from a section of the club's supporters. As for what Real would expect to receive in return for selling Ronaldo, Metro says "a €150m (£131m) bid could be enough".

But The Sun thinks that even more money could be about to change hands and claims that United are poised to offer Real Madrid "a deal of unbelievable proportions" and one which involves offering the European champions "£183m and David de Gea for Cristiano Ronaldo and Alvaro Morata".

The United goalkeeper has long been linked with a return to his homeland, and the Sun says Old Trafford chiefs are ready to make that happen provided they receive Ronaldo and striker Morato in return.

PM ‘found £1bn to keep her own job’ so why can’t find similar amount to keep nurses and teachers in their jobs, Labour leader asks

Jeremy Corbyn accused Theresa May of presiding over “a low-pay epidemic” in the UK as he used a noisy and boisterous prime minister’s questions to challenge her repeatedly over the continued cap on public sector pay.

Following a week in which several ministers have called for the cap to be eased, May vigorously defended continued austerity, saying it was more unfair still to “load debt on our children and grandchildren”.

The Labour leader used all his questions to pressure May over issues of pay. He began by noting the prime minister’s acknowledgement of the 69th anniversary of the NHS, adding: “I was hoping she was going to say a bit more about NHS staff and their pay during her birthday greetings.

“After a week of flip-flopping and floundering, we thought we’d got some clarity from Downing Street at last.”

May outlined the process by which a series of pay review bodies recommend rises for NHS staff, teachers and others, and said the government would “consider those reports very carefully”.

But she added: “We will always recognise the need to makes those decisions against the need to live within our means.” Both she and Corbyn valued the contribution of public sector workers, May said but added: “The difference is, I know we have to pay for them.”

May also claimed the UK could go the way of Greece if it does not keep controls on public spending in a defence of austerity that echoed the messages of David Cameron and George Osborne in the 2015 election.



Several other ministers and aides went on to echo that comparison with Greece in a sign there is a concerted effort by the Conservatives to stress their desire for “sound money” and attack Labour on the issue of economic competence.

“There are siren calls from Labour to abandon any kind of fiscal restraint whatsoever, and we’ve seen what happens,” a Conservative spokesman said after PMQs. “What happens, we’ve seen as a case study, is what happens in Greece, and as [the prime minister] pointed out, that saw a 36% reduction in health spending in Greece, and that is no good for nurses and doctors. I think she was suggesting if Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party got the chance to impose its fiscal policies on the United Kingdom that is a very real threat.”

A spokesman for Corbyn described the claims on Greece as “preposterous”.

“The situation in Greece is tied up with the eurozone and the management of the eurozone banks – we’re not remotely in that situation. Our manifesto and our pledges were costed, unlike the government’s,” he said.



Later, Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said the cap on public sector pay was the “responsible thing to do” in response to an urgent question from Labour.



“The process is very simple, we’ve received recommendations from pay review bodies already this year,” she said. “They make decisions based on the individual circumstances within those sectors, we have followed all of their recommendations, we will look at the further recommendations we need to make decisions on and we will look at that balance between affordability and making sure that we retain and recruit high quality public sector workers.



“But this is the right approach, it’s not saying that we’re going to open up the cheque book, bankrupt our public services and see people lose their jobs.”

But during PMQs, Corbyn argued the continued 1% pay limit was causing “real shortages in nursing and teaching” as well as hardship, and accused ministers of “recklessly exploiting the goodwill of public servants”.

Responding to May’s insistence that the government provided “good management of the economy”, Corbyn said: “The prime minister simply doesn’t get it. There is a low-pay epidemic in this country and it has a terrible effect on young people. Those in their 20s will earn £12,500 a year less than the generation that went before them – the first generation to be worse off than the last.

“They’re less likely to be able to buy their own homes, more likely to be saddled with debt, more likely to be in insecure, low-paid work. Except for more misery, what does the prime minister and her government actually offer for the young people of this country?”

Saying the UK was among the only nations where wages had not recovered since the economic crash, Corbyn said more people were using food banks and 4 million children were growing up in poverty.

He said: “The low-pay epidemic is a threat to our economic stability. So can she take some tough choices and instead of offering platitudes, offer some real help, and real support for those in work, young people who deserve better and deserve to be given more optimism rather than greater inequality?”

May responded vigorously, bringing cheers and cries of “more” from some backbenchers.

She said: “It isn’t fair to refuse to take tough decisions and to load debt on our children and grandchildren. It isn’t fair to bankrupt our economy, because that leads to people losing their jobs, and losing their homes.



“And it isn’t fair to go out and tell people that they can have all the public spending they want without paying for it.”

May was also attacked by Corbyn over the cost of her deal to win support from the Democratic Unionists. He said: “The prime minister found £1bn to keep her own job. Why can’t she find the same amount of money to keep nurses and teachers in their job, who after all serve all of us?”

In response, May taunted the Labour leader for calling his frontbench a “government in waiting”. She said: “We all know what that means: waiting to put up taxes, waiting to destroy jobs, waiting to bankrupt out country. We will never let it happen.”

British workers feel "frustrated and squeezed" by their pay, which has flatlined for more than a decade, the Bank of England's chief economist Andy Haldane told BBC Newsnight.

But despite broad stagnation in wage growth, it is still possible to maximise your chances of getting a pay rise. Here's what the experts recommend:

Simply ask

According to the Financial Times, "the first rule of negotiating a pay rise is to ask for it."

However, don't do it via email or text message, says Green & Black's boss Josephine Fairley in the Daily Telegraph.

"Preferably, pay rises need to be asked for face-to-face. As a boss, it's never great when someone emails and says, 'I work hard and I'm broke. I need more money,' which has happened to me in the past. These things need to be done in the context of a proper review."

Know your worth

Do a bit of research to find out what people in the same position as you are being paid elsewhere, says The Guardian: "Check job sites on the internet and newspaper ads for comparable rates of pay for your position. Trade magazines frequently carry out salary surveys."

Aim high

As with any negotiation, you should always ask for more than you expect to be given, says jobs website Monster.co.uk. But don't go in with an outrageously inflated figure at first offering.

You should also give your boss a set period within which to respond, the site suggests. "Buried in that is the implication that you have other options, and the company may risk losing you if they don't at least meet you halfway."

Talk to your boss after lunch

According to careers coach Simon North, co-founder and director of careers consultancy Position Ignition, talking to your boss after he or she has eaten is key. "After lunch – having eaten and with their blood sugars higher, it is a better time to broach tough subjects," he told ShortList.

Consider taking other benefits

If you work for a business that is experiencing financial difficulties, cash may not be an option, so consider asking for non-financial benefits such as flexible working or longer holidays, the FT says.

Roger Federer will be out to complete unfinished business at Wimbledon on Thursday after he was denied a chance to savour match-point glory in his first-round match.

Seven-times champion Federer takes on Dusan Lajovic in round two, and will be hoping to put on an entertaining show from start to finish after Tuesday's fans were left feeling rather short-changed.

Federer's opponent, Alexandr Dolgopolov, pulled out when trailing 3-6 0-3, to hand Federer an easy route into the second round.

Here’s everything you need to know as Federer attempts to make it into the third round for the fourth successive year.

Who is Dusan Lajovic?

Lajovic has never before played Federer (Getty)



A 27-year-old Slovenia, who excels on clay. He has reached two ATP finals – losing at the Vegeta Croatia Open in 2014 and winning the Istanbul Open a year later – and reached the fourth round of the French Open in 2014.

However, he’s only made it past the first round of Wimbledon once before, in 2014, when he lost to Poland’s Łukasz Kubot in four sets in the second.

What’s the head to head record?

The pair have never player against one another before.

What has Federer been saying?

Roger Federer serves in his Wimbledon first-round victory ( Getty )

“The thing what's nice about when you're not playing tournaments is that you're in charge of your daily routines. If you're carrying an injury, well, you don't have to practice. If you don't feel so well, you're sick, whatever, you don't have to play through it. That's nice about it.

“But, of course, at the end I'm a tennis player, I'm a match player, that's why I want to be. Sometimes you have to reset to come back there.

“I just think for me to have this sort of really, like, big distance to actually playing matches and understanding that I won't be around for a long time, really put me in a place where I could really relax and do other things, not think about tennis day-to-day.”

What are the odds?

Roger Federer to win: 1/100

​Dusan Lajovic to win: 42/1

You opened it as a child, or maybe a fresh-faced adult looking for somewhere to put your first pay cheque. Your parents probably have one with the same bank.

The chances are you’ve never moved your current account in your entire adult life, regardless of how impressed or otherwise you are with the service, fees or rates on offer by your bank or building society.

In fact, the situation had become so static and uncompetitive for consumers that a huge initiative making switching your current account quickly and easily was launched in a bid to combat fears that changing current account provider would mean lost direct debits, complex arrangements and a long drawn out process altogether.

And yet, 99 per cent of current accounts were switched in 7 days or less last year.

So with news of current account closures hitting the headlines, some juicy cashback incentives, not to mention ranks of complacent banks and building societies, how can you go about securing the best current account for your everyday money needs? As with so much in life, it really depends on what you’re looking for.

Current accounts defined

But what are we actually talking about here? A current account is the most straightforward financial product available to British consumers. It’s held with a bank or building society and allows the account holder to access their money with the minimum fuss.

Facilities include the ability to withdraw money (with no notice using a bank card that combines cash, debit and cheque guarantee services), deposit money simply and easily in cash, cheque or electronic form, such as salary, pension income or benefits and set up consistent ways to pay bills and costs via direct debits and standing orders.

Not having one can dramatically restrict your ability to access and use your money, even earn it in some cases. The effects can be felt across every aspect of life so there have been significant initiatives over the years to ensure that even those with the lowest or non-existent credit score are eligible for a basic bank account.

Comparing current account deals

They may have long been a necessity in modern UK life, but in 2017, having the best current account can be the difference between punitive charges and some lucrative gains, particularly when it comes to rewards for switching.

Switch to an online bank account from First Direct and you’ll benefit from £125 of cash for your new account, for example.

But Smile’s current deal is hard to beat. Transfer to the cheerful bank's Current Account and you'll receive a market-leading £150 when you switch.

Of course, if you’re only comfortable with the ups and downs of modern life when you’ve got a decent financial cushion to hand then £100 or so just won’t cut it. In which case, you’ll need a high interest current account. Enter the Nationwide Flex Direct, by far the best deal on offer right now with a 5% introductory rate for the first 12 months - followed by a follow-on rate of 1% - for balances of up to £2,500.

If, for some inexplicable reason you don't want to go with the UK's biggest building society, perhaps preferring a consistent interest rate, it may be worth plumping for Santander’s 123 account, offering 1.5 per cent interest on balances of up to £20,000, monthly cashback on household bills and an interest free overdraft for the first four months.

Elsewhere, if you’re at the other end of the spectrum and describe yourself more as a spender than saver, you’ll gain the most from a cashback offer. In which case, NatWest’s current account deal is likely to be your best fit, offering 3 per cent cashback on your household bills.

And if you're a consistent shopper with high street brands like M&S can remain in the black, a rewards account could see you quids in. The M&S Current Account offers £185 rewards to spend in the store and access to 5% interest, with some conditions.

There are also rewards if your spending has got a little out of hand and you’re heading for overdraft territory. First Direct is likely to be a good port of call in this particular storm.

(Which? recently revealed that banks charge us more for overdrafts than those infamous payday lenders do for their eye-wateringly expensive borrowing)

Its deal offers a £125 switching reward if you go through MoneySupermarket.com and 0 per cent interest on your first £250 of overdraft.

So don’t be a slave to your bank account, now is the perfect time to make sure this foundation for your entire financial life fits that life.

You’ve got the cocktail shaker. You dutifully made a stash of ice. And although you remembered the lemon and lime wedges, somehow the good intentions to blend a passion fruit and muddle some mint went awry.

Infusing your own spirits and making cocktails with fresh ingredients is lovely. But let’s face it, sometimes you just want a shortcut. Packed with flavour and easy to mix, flavoured vodkas can offer a tasty, straightforward option. Add to that a recent trend for increasingly premium flavours, and there are now a wide number of simple drinks to be made at home.

So, what makes a good flavoured vodka? Firstly, with vodka being a particularly good flavour carrier, we’re looking for it to actually taste of its namesake ingredient. Intense, well-rounded, bold – we’re looking for flavours with impact, and that don’t taste overly artificial. And let’s not forget the underlying vodka itself. We’re looking for quality and some discernible character showing through.

So, from coffee to ginger, here’s our round-up of the best.

1. Chase Espresso Vodka, 40%: £40 for 700ml, John Lewis

If you’ve ever had Patrón XO Café you’ll know what a heavenly combination booze and coffee can be. And this limited edition from Herefordshire distiller Chase is just as heavenly, perhaps more so in many ways. Light in colour and not overly sweet, it delivers that intense burst of coffee but without being excessively bitter. Made from Ethiopian coffee and a base of Chase’s English Potato Vodka, it’s slowly distilled through a copper gin still, then cold brewed, chill filtered and blended with more coffee. We’re just going to get the clichés out of our system because this vodka warrants them; smooth as silk, soft as velvet, etc etc. Sip on its own and let the flavours of muscovado sugar and bitter coffee slowly unfold. You may want to set aside an evening to slowly savour this one.

2. Zubrowka Bison Grass Flavoured Vodka, 40%: £17 for 700ml, Waitrose

Throw this in the freezer, buy some cloudy apple juice and mix for a drinks nirvana. This is what it’s all about, especially on a hot summer’s day. This Polish vodka is 100 per cent grain, and having been distilled seven times is exceptionally smooth. Not the most overtly flavoured, each bottle contains a blade of bison grass, giving the liquid a subtle green tinge. Taste-wise, there’s a lot of almond up-front, with a big, rich, oily mouthfeel and a big burst of fruit (similar to grapefruit) followed by beautiful marzipan notes. Honestly, try the apple juice mix. Perfection.

3. Cîroc Pineapple, 37.5%: £38.50 for 700ml, Tesco

Who needs rum? Make ours a vodka Piña Colada! This gorgeous offering from the French vodka house is made, quite fittingly, with grapes. But it’s bursting with the juiciness of ripe pineapples, followed by just a hint of coconut. A flavour match made in heaven, it’s ideal for all your summer drinks. However, if you want that coconut dialled-up a touch, go for the new limited-edition flavour, Cîroc Summer Colada.

Buy now

4. Absolut Raspberri, 40%: £16 for 700ml, Asda

Big and fruity, this gorgeously rich raspberry vodka smells like jam. But, whereas some fruit-flavoured vodkas can be overly sweet and a little synthetic tasting, this one is made from ripened raspberries harvested in the Swedish hillsides, and contains no added sugar. Mix with a cranberry juice for a refreshing summer drink. Or if you want to bust out that cocktail shaker to impress any guests, add lemon juice, simple syrup and soda water and garnish with raspberries for an Absolut Raspberri Collins.

5. Whitley Neill Blood Orange Vodka, 43%: £25.85 for 700ml, The Whisky Exchange

This Sicilian-inspired vodka from the much-lauded gin maker is pretty new having launched just under a year ago. Though the bottle is orange, the liquid pours clear. There’s tangerine, and a slightly sherbet nose, and to sip, it’s zesty and slightly lemony. But overall, there’s a satisfying orange intensity. Though perfect in summer cocktails due to its underlying hint of spice, we’re going to stash this one away for some warming winter cocktails when the weather turns. Meanwhile, just throw in a quality tonic for a burst of Sicilian summer.

6. Curio Cocoa Nib Vodka, 40%: £30.45 for 700ml, The Whisky Exchange

The beautifully packaged vodkas from Cornish distiller Curio endear themselves before you’ve even tasted them, with their sweet squat bottles and pared-back design. But as you know, we’re not ones to judge books by their covers. And though we have to acknowledge the brand’s very aromatic and floral Cardamom Vodka, it’s the Cocoa Nib Vodka that has us salivating. With a slightly milky chocolate nose, there’s no heat or spice from the triple-distilled vodka spirit, which has been infused with Peruvian Cocoa Nibs. It’s kind of like a boozy version of the chocolate milk you have left after your Coco Pops, but with a hint of lemon cutting through it. It’s nostalgia and refinement all in one. Good enough to sip neat, though we can imagine this in an Espresso Martini. Mocha Martini anyone?

7. Nelson’s Gold Caramelised Vodka, 26.5%: £29.13 for 500ml, Master of Malt

This is decadence bottled. The good folk at Norfolk premium vodka brand, Wild Knight, must have been feeling naughty when they put this delightful concoction together. Technically a liqueur (due to its abv and the addition of sugar) we had to include it in our list due to its stand-out deliciousness. Made in small batches using Norfolk-grown barley, this rich delight still retains the sippable smoothness of the original vodka, but the addition of caramelised Norfolk sugar beet makes this akin to drinking pure caramel. You can mix with apple juice, but to be honest, this is one that’s best enjoyed chilled and sipped.

Buy now

8. Hophead Hop Vodka, 45%: £35.95 for 750ml, The Whisky Exchange

From the same company behind US craft beer legends, Anchor Brewing, comes this hopped vodka. In fact, it’s the Anchor Distilling company based in San Francisco, California that is responsible for this inspired tipple. Pot-distilled and unfiltered, this is very robust in flavour. While the vodka itself is very smooth, peppery and oily, the hops add earthiness and some mineral-like, menthol notes. Certainly an acquired taste, but we love it.

9. Virtuous Vodka Organic Ginger, 38%: £27.95 for 700ml, The Whisky Exchange

Organic. Check. Preservative free. Check. No added sugars, flavours or aromas. Check. This Swedish rye-based vodka ticks all the boxes when it comes to its all-natural credentials. In fact, Virtuous Vodka claims to be a “grown-up” and “crafted” take on flavoured vodkas. There are two things of note when it comes to the taste though. Firstly, because it’s unfiltered, the liquid is cloudy and may contain a natural sediment. And – as with the other flavours in the range – the ginger taste is very true to life. We’ve chosen Ginger over the Raspberry and Bitter Lemon flavours, as while there’s a wealth of ginger drinks available, few manage to capture the authentic taste of ginger root. Tangy, with a little heat, it’s in a word, delicious.

The Verdict: Flavoured vodkas

Winning brownie points for its richness, stand-out full coffee flavour and easy mixability, we simply love this latest release from Chase. Though there are some considerably lower-priced vodkas on our list, we truly think Espresso Vodka is worth every penny.

Bedene has played at Wimbledon five times, but only three times as a Briton Stefan Wermuth/Reuters

Aljaz Bedene reached the third round of Wimbledon for the first time with victory over four sets against Damir Dzumhur of Bosnia and credited having home crowd support as the decisive factor in his 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 win.

“I couldn’t have won without them,” the world No 58 said.

This is Bedene’s fifth appearance at Wimbledon but his third as a British citizen and so the spectators are still getting to know him, to understand his style of play, his character out on court. And they are still, probably, none the wiser because this was a baffling contest, one that Bedene could and should have won speedily and convincingly but during which, instead, he wavered.

Bedene’s second serve was weak all afternoon Adam Davy/PA

Rarely will you see as reliable a first serve…

Why go now?

Amid the buzz surrounding British artist Bruce Munro’s epic light installation at Uluru, which was recently extended until next March, Australia’s original outback town has fallen off the tourist radar. But skipping Alice Springs on a Red Centre holiday would be a mistake.

Befitting its status as the artistic capital of central Australia, “The Alice” boasts more art galleries (per capita) than anywhere else in the country, and is perennially in festival mode. The big one for July is the annual Camel Cup (camelcup.com.au) on the 15th, followed by the Desert Festival (desfest.com), Central Australia’s premier arts bash, from 18 August until 7 September. Yet between its fascinating heritage sites, unique attractions and many outdoor activities, there’s plenty to do in The Alice at any time of the year.

Get your bearings

Roughly marking Australia’s geographic centre, Alice Springs might be the Northern Territory’s third largest town, but residents number less than 30,000. Hugging the left bank of the Todd River (which is bone dry for most of the year), the sleepy centre is laid out in a grid and is easy to navigate on foot. Sights outside the core, including historic Telegraph Station (1), the Araluen Arts Centre (2), and Alice Springs Desert Park (3), are an easy cycle – bikes can be borrowed from most hotels.

Day one

Take a view

Topped by a memorial dedicated to those who have served in defence of their country, Anzac Hill (4) is the perfect spot to survey The Alice. Take the stairs from Wills Terrace or drive up Anzac Hill Rd for panoramic views of the town and the spectacular MacDonnell Ranges that frame it. Sacred to the local Arrernte people, the “Macs” form part of the caterpillar jukurrpa (creation story). Indeed, it’s not difficult to picture the undulating ranges as giant caterpillars marching across the scorched earth in ancient times.

Take a hike

Start at the Visitor Information Centre off Todd Mall (5) (00 61 8 8952 5800; discovercentralaustralia.com), the town’s main artery. The centre is open 8.30am-5pm Monday to Friday, and from 9.30am-4pm on weekends. Heading northwest along Parsons Street, you’ll pass heritage buildings including the Old Stuart Town Gaol (6) built in 1908 and The Residency (7) (00 61 8 8951 1122; araluenartscentre.nt.gov.au/residency), where Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh lodged for two nights in 1963 as part of their Royal Visit to Australia. Built in 1928, the former home of the government resident during Alice Springs’ brief tenure as the capital of Central Australia can be visited from 10am-3pm weekdays.

Continue along Parsons Street until you reach the junction of Railway Terrace. Making a left, you can’t miss the enormous mural (8) depicting Territory life and history that covers the entire side of the Coles supermarket building. Painted by community volunteers in 1981, it’s the town’s most famous piece of public art.

From here it’s a 10-minute walk to the Royal Flying Doctor Service (9) (00 61 8 8952 1129; flyingdoctor.org.au), which now houses a state-of-the-art tourist facility. Running every half hour from 9am-4pm Monday to Saturday, tours (£9) include a short introduction by staff, a holographic show, and access to a small museum. Around the corner on Stuart Terrace, the former women’s prison now houses the delightfully oddball Pioneer Women’s Hall of Fame (10) (00 61 8 8952 9006; pioneerwomen.com.au). It’s open daily from 9am-5pm; entry is £6.

Lunch on the run

Pick up a fresh sandwich or traditional Aussie meat pie at The Bakery (11) (00 428 595 429; alicebakery.com.au) – it’s open 8am-1pm Saturday and Sunday and until 2pm Wednesday to Friday – or head to Piccolo’s (12) (00 61 8 8953 1936) for a decadent toastie or sit-down cafe meal such as a steak sandwich or homemade lasagne. It’s open 7am-2pm Saturday, 8am-noon Sunday, and 7am-3pm Tuesday to Friday.

Window shopping

Shopping in Alice Springs centres around Aboriginal art. Dedicated to providing high-quality contemporary art while ensuring artists who work with them (who you can often watch in the on-site studio) are treated well and paid fairly, Yubu Napa (13) (00 61 8 8952 2007; yubunapa.com) should be your first stop. It’s open 10am-4pm Saturday, and until 6pm weekdays. Papunya Tula Artists (14) (00 61 8 8952 4731; papunyatula.com.au) is also renowned for showcasing particularly exquisite works. It’s open 10am-2pm Saturday, and 9am-5pm Monday to Friday.

An aperitif

Packed to the rafters with outback memorabilia, Bojangles Saloon (15) (00 61 475 228 733), open 11.30am-2am daily, is a fun spot for a schooner of NT Draught. For a more classic Aussie pub vibe, head to the Todd Tavern (16) (00 61 8 8952 1255; toddtavern.com.au) at the north end of the mall; open noon-midnight daily. Note that Alice is a “dry” town, which means drinking is banned in public spaces.

Dine with the locals

Part gastro pub, part outback circus, Monte’s (17) (00 61 8 8952 4336; montes.net.au) is a quintessential Alice Springs dining experience – it’s open Wednesday to Sunday. The pub grub is decent, but those looking for more than pizzas and burgers (from £6) may prefer the mod-Oz offerings at Epilogue Lounge (18) (00 61 429 003 874), which also has a decent wine list. The best table in town, however, is at Hanuman (19) (00 61 8 8953 7188; hanuman.com.au), the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel’s Thai and Indian fusion restaurant. It’s all about sharing here; make one of your small plates the Punjabi lamb cutlets, served with a delicious yoghurt sauce (£12).

Day two

Take a ride

Who knew Alice Springs had over 200km of well-tended mountain biking trails? Beat the heat and sign up for an early-morning tour (£87/three hours) with Outback Cycling (00 61 8 8952 1541; outbackcycling.com) or rent a bike and explore yourself. It’s a lovely 4km-cycle north of town to Telegraph Station (1) (00 61 8 8952 3993; alicespringstelegraphstation.com.au), established in 1871 to relay messages between Darwin and Adelaide. There are four guided tours of this must-see historical reserve daily between 9am-5pm, all included in the £8 ticket price.

Out to brunch

Refuel with eggs any way and a perfectly brewed espresso coffee at Page 27 (20) (00 61 8 8952 0191), arguably the hippest cafe in Alice Springs. The central location – tucked just off Todd Mall – is a bonus, though you’ll need to get there early on weekends to snag a table. It’s open 8am-2pm Saturday and Sunday, and 7.30am-2.30pm Tuesday to Friday.

Cultural afternoon

The pinnacle of the Alice Springs arts circuit, the Araleun Arts Centre (2) (00 61 8 8951 1122; araluenartscentre.nt.gov.au) focuses on contemporary Aboriginal art, with a dedicated gallery showcasing the works of renowned watercolourist Albert Namatjira. There’s also a professional theatre; check the website for upcoming events. Your ticket (£9) includes entry to the adjoining Museum of Central Australia, the Central Aviation Museum, the Strehlow Research Centre, and a host of public works including the impressive Yeperenye Sculpture. It’s open 10am-4pm daily.

A walk in the park

If you didn’t spot any rock wallabies around Telegraph Station, head to the Alice Springs Desert Park (3) (00 61 8 8951 8788; alicespringsdesertpark.com.au) where you can see the creatures of Central Australia on display in a series of recreated habitats, 2.5km west of town (open 7.30am-6pm daily). If you prefer a walk closer to centre, take a spin around the Olive Pink Botanic Garden (21) (00 61 8 8952 2154; opbg.com.au), which showcases over 600 central Australian plants. It’s open 8am-6pm daily with entry by donation.

The icing on the cake

Stay on to take a day trip of the mesmerising gorges, waterholes and sacred sites of the West MacDonnell ranges (22). Hire a car or join an organised tour with the likes of Alice Wanderer (00 61 8 8952 2111; alicewanderer.com.au) or Emu Run (00 61 8 8953 7057; emurun.com.au) which take in key stops such as Ellery Creek Big Hole, Ormiston Gorge, Simpson’s Gap, the Ochre Pits, and more. For Aboriginal rock art, head to the lesser-visited East Macs.

Travel essentials

Getting there

Located 15km south of town, Alice Springs Airport (23) is serviced by Qantas (00 61 07 3815 8000; qantas.com) from eight domestic hubs, several of which connect to London. A shuttle operates for all scheduled incoming and outgoing flights (£9; about 20 minutes travel time). A taxi (00 61 8 8952 1877) to the centre costs roughly £11.

Staying there

It could do with an update, but the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Alice Springs (19) (00 61 8 8950 8000; doubletree3.hilton.com) is arguably still the nicest hotel in town. Doubles from £75, room only. It’s worth stumping an additional £11 for a mountain-view room.

If you’re driving, consider Squeaky Windmill (24) (00 0414 885 034; squeakywindmill.com). Nestled at the base of the West Macs, just 15km from town, this boutique B&B has two luxury tented rooms (one queen, one twin), with barbecue hampers available if you’d rather dine in for dinner. Both rooms cost £110, B&B.

You might remember Lasseters (25) (00 61 08 8950 7777; crowneplazaalicesprings.com.au) from 1994’s Priscilla: Queen of the Desert, in which the cast played a cabaret gig at the adjoining casino. Rebranded as Crowne Plaza Alice Springs Lasseters last December, the resort’s comfortable – if tired – rooms should give the DoubleTree’s a run for their money following an upgrade that is currently in progress. Doubles start at £58, room only.

London’s Royal Free hospital failed to comply with the Data Protection Act when it handed over personal data of 1.6 million patients to DeepMind, a Google subsidiary, according to the Information Commissioner’s Office.

The data transfer was part of the two organisation’s partnership to create the healthcare app Streams, an alert, diagnosis and detection system for acute kidney injury. The ICO’s ruling was largely based on the fact that the app continued to undergo testing after patient data was transferred. Patients, it said, were not adequately informed that their data would be used as part of the test.

“Our investigation found a number of shortcomings in the way patient records were shared for this trial,” said Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner. “Patients would not have reasonably expected their information to have been used in this way, and the Trust could and should have been far more transparent with patients as to what was happening.

“We’ve asked the Trust to commit to making changes that will address those shortcomings, and their co-operation is welcome. The Data Protection Act is not a barrier to innovation, but it does need to be considered wherever people’s data is being used.”

The ICO ruled that testing the app with real patient data went beyond Royal Free’s authority, particularly given how broad the scope of the data transfer was. “A patient presenting at accident and emergency within the last five years to receive treatment or a person who engages with radiology services and who has had little or no prior engagement with the Trust would not reasonably expect their data to be accessible to a third party for the testing of a new mobile application, however positive the aims of that application may be,” the office said in its findings.

While privacy campaigners were hoping the ruling would touch on the continued use of patient data for the production version of Streams, the ICO was muted on the live use of Streams in a clinical environment, but warned that “concerns regarding the necessity and proportionality of the use of the sensitive data of 1.6 million patients remain”.

The Royal Free has been asked to commission a third-party audit of the trial following the ruling, complete a privacy assessment, set out how it will better comply with its duties in future trials and establish a proper legal basis for the DeepMind project.

In a statement, the hospital trust said: “We are pleased that the information commissioner … has allowed us to continue using the app which is helping us to get the fastest treatment to our most vulnerable patients – potentially saving lives.

“We accept the ICO’s findings and have already made good progress to address the areas where they have concerns. For example, we are now doing much more to keep our patients informed about how their data is used. We would like to reassure patients that their information has been in our control at all times and has never been used for anything other than delivering patient care or ensuring their safety.”

The ruling does not directly criticise DeepMind, a London-based AI company purchased by Google in 2013, since the ICO views the Royal Free as the “data controller” responsible for upholding the data protection act throughout its partnership with Streams, with DeepMind acting as a data processor on behalf of the trust.

In a blogpost, the company said: “We welcome the ICO’s thoughtful resolution of this case, which we hope will guarantee the ongoing safe and legal handling of patient data for Streams.

“Although today’s findings are about the Royal Free, we need to reflect on our own actions too. In our determination to achieve quick impact when this work started in 2015, we underestimated the complexity of the NHS and of the rules around patient data, as well as the potential fears about a well-known tech company working in health.

“We were almost exclusively focused on building tools that nurses and doctors wanted, and thought of our work as technology for clinicians rather than something that needed to be accountable to and shaped by patients, the public and the NHS as a whole. We got that wrong, and we need to do better.”

The company highlighted a number of changes it had made since the launch of Streams, including a significant increase in transparency, and the creation of a independent health review board.

Streams has since been rolled out to other British hospitals, and DeepMind has also branched out into other clinical trials, including a project aimed at using machine-learning techniques to improve diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, and another aimed at using similar techniques to better prepare radiotherapists for treating head and neck cancers.

While some eyes are focussed on Andy Murray's progress at SW19 for the next few weeks, ​there's British sporting excellence ongoing elsewhere.

Geraint Thomas became the eighth Brit to lead the Tour de France when he won Saturday's opening stage, and he's joined some illustrious company...

Tom Simpson

Days in yellow: 1

One of Britain's greatest ever cyclists, Tommy Simpson spent just a single day in the Maillot Jaune in 1962, a daring attack up the Col du Tourmalet in the race's first mountain stage saw him become the first Britain to don the famous leader's jersey.

Simpson finished sixth that year, 17 minutes behind five-time winner Jacques Anquetil. He would only finish one more Tour de France in his career, registering a DNF in 1965, '66 and '67; the year in which he died while ascending Mont Ventoux on the 13th stage.

Chris Boardman

Days in yellow: 6

A superlative time-trialist, Boardman ended Britain's 32-year wait for a Tour leader in 1994 when he thrashed around a 7.2km prologue in Lille to put 15 seconds between him and second-placed Miguel Indurain.

He held that jersey a further two days before being unseated by classics specialist Johan Museeuw, but came back to snatch the yellow jersey in the 1997 and 1998 prologues.

Sean Yates

Days in yellow: 1

You wait 32 years for a British yellow jersey wearer, then two come along in a week.

A punishing 270.5km stage six in 1994 saw Yates jump into a breakaway early on, finishing sixth in the stage behind Gianluca Bortolami - but ended the day one second ahead thanks to a better prologue performance the previous Saturday.

David Miller

Days in yellow: 3

Another tour beginning with a time trial, another Briton in yellow. The 16.5km stage against the clock in Futuroscope was Miller's first experience in the famous race, and saw him beat a pre-doping scandal Lance Armstrong by two seconds.

It wasn't until a team time trial three days later that he was deposed, Laurent Jalabert taking advantage of the strength in depth of his ONCE-Deutsche Bank team to wear yellow for the next two days.

Bradley Wiggins

Days in yellow: 13

Track star turned time-trialist turned Grand Tour contender, Wiggins took the lead at the ski resort of La Planche des Belles Filles in stage seven of the 2012 event - a stage which was actually won by his teammate Chris Froome.

He and his Team Sky squad never relinquished that lead, their dominance such that they took a rare one-two with Froome in second place.

Chris Froome

Days in yellow: 44

In the absence of Wiggins in 2013, Froome stepped up as Team Sky's leader in style. A dominant team display saw him wear the maillot jaune from the eighth stage through to Paris - a feat he repeated in 2016.

2015, though, was possibly Froome's crowning moment. Bouncing back from the disappointment of an injury-enforced exit the year before, the Nairobi-born Brit spent all but five days of the race in yellow across two different spells. Don't bet against a fourth success in 2017.

Mark Cavendish

Days in yellow: 1

The absence of an opening time trial in the 2016 edition of the Tour gave the sprinters a chance to snatch the lead early, and Cavendish grabbed that opportunity with both hands to beat out Marcel Kittel and Peter Sagan - his first of four stage wins last year.

Geraint Thomas

Days in yellow: Ongoing

A masterful performance in the driving rain in Düsseldorf on Saturday saw the Welshman become the eighth Brit to wear one of sport's most recognisable strips. Don't expect him to hold it through to Paris though - he'll be riding in support of his team leader Froome.

There’s a reason social care is a hot topic for politicians campaigning in the run up to 8 June. More of us than ever will come to need it. But covering the cost of long-term care is a very expensive business indeed. State-funding rules change all the time so few of us have any idea how we’ll pay for it.

Just one in 10 of the over-45s have set aside anything to help pay for potential car costs and it’s no surprise that 40 per cent of us don’t think we’ll need to, according to research by financial planner Tilney. In fact, around 80 per cent of us will need some sort of care by the time we hit our eighties.

While wannabe MPs battle it out with soundbites, threats and empty promises, on the ground it’s time to take control of your future and that of your loved ones. If you or your elderly parents or relatives need residential care in later life, ensuring that you have the right financial plan in place can be a minefield. Decisions often need to be made in a very short time, and at a time of great emotional stress.

This pressure combined with the complexity of the system can result in benefits being missed and people being inappropriately funded, or worrying that their money will run out.

“It’s extremely complicated,” says Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK. “Unless you’ve encountered the system before it is easy to feel befuddled.”

Funding for care is means-tested, most will end up paying something towards their care, but ensuring that your parent or relative is getting everything that they are entitled to in terms of tax reductions and extra benefits can make a difference to the whole family’s comfort levels at what can be a difficult time.

What do you need?

Long-term care is a very broad term, covering everything from temporary placements for those who need to recuperate from a fall or illness, to round-the-clock dementia care and end-of-life palliative care. Your family member may need different types of care at different times in his or her life, so it is important to build in flexibility to meet changing needs.

Depending on what type of care is needed, the financial picture can change. Some forms of benefit are only available to those with very severe medical needs, while different rules apply when care is likely to be temporary rather than permanent. There are also some forms of care available at home, which can be a less costly alternative to full residential care, depending on the needs of the individual, while warden-controlled or “sheltered” housing can also be an option.

A local authority care assessment is a good place to start, particularly if you are confused about your relative’s needs, and is essential if you are hoping that the council will fund any part of his or her care. The council has a statutory duty to provide this, and it should be carried out by a qualified health professional.

After it is done a care plan will provided with advice on what your love one needs, and what type of care is appropriate for them. Not all types of care home are suitable for all needs. If your relative needs nursing care’, for example, they will need a home that offers more support than an ordinary care home.

Get a financial assessment

Working out how to pay for care is complex. In many cases the council will bear some of the cost but most people will have to pay for a part of their care out of their own pocket.

Care costs can be very high. The average residential care bill is over £29,000 and the average stay is around two years, according to figures from Laing & Buisson.

For those requiring nursing care or other specific care, the bill is higher, while many people may wish to choose more expensive care homes for their relatives because they prefer the facilities or the ambience.

If you do this, you need to ensure your relative will have enough money to stay there for a potentially long time, or that your family is able to pay any proportion of the bill that is not being met by the local authority.

The average life expectancy for a man aged 65 is now 84 years, while a woman of the same age could expect to reach her 86th birthday, while many live longer, so bear this in mind when doing your calculations.

Local authorities will look at your relative’s assets and income when deciding how much they must pay towards their care. At present, if their capital and income is above £23,250 they will have to pay their own fees. Those with less than £14,250 worth of assets will have to pay nothing, and those assessed as having somewhere in the middle will pay some. If your relative is assessed as needing care in their own home, the value of the house will not be taken into account, but if they are in need of residential care this will be included if they live alone. If a partner lives there, though, or a relative over 60 or child under 18 then the value of the home will be disregarded when the assessment is made.

David Samson, from from financial hardship charity Turn2Us, says that a local authority will give one of three outcomes, “either, agree to meet the full cost of your care needs, agree to meet some of the cost, and you’ll need to top up the rest or it will leave you meet the full cost of your care”.

Many people who go into care do not want to sell their home, especially if it is far from clear how long they will need to be in care for. Local councils have to offer what is called a “deferred payment system” for those who do not want to sell their homes to pay for care. This means you can delay paying the costs of your care until a later date, and the costs can be paid after you die out of the estate. The local authority can charge interest on the scheme, currently at around 2 per cent, and are required by law to offer it. However these schemes are poorly utilised and seldom promoted. “There are some local authorities that haven’t lent out a single penny on this scheme,” says Steve Lowe, from retirement finance expert JRP.

The Tory manifesto suggests that these schemes will play a bigger part in the funding landscape in future. The party’s proposals suggest that although no-one will have to sell their home to pay for care, they will have to use a scheme akin to the deferred payment system or to current equity release schemes to pay for care. When those in residential care die, the care costs will be clawed back from their estates. However, under the Tories plan, once the value of the individual’s assets has fallen to £100,000 the government will pay the cost of care.

Choosing a home

Just because the local authority does the assessment, it doesn’t mean that you have to choose one of its homes for your relative. If you choose a more expensive care home for your relative, you may choose to pay top-up payments on top of the local authority’s funding or they, or you, can pay the whole amount. You can also choose to move your relative closer to you, if you are far away, and still receive the funding.

Take time to make the decision, and don’t be rushed, says Age UK’s Abrahams. “Even if you have the hospital breathing down your neck and saying that they want the bed, it is important to take this one step at a time.”

Entitlements

When your relative moves into a home, they may be entitled to more or fewer benefits, depending on their circumstances.

The most important thing to check is whether they are eligible for NHS Continuing Care. This is for people who have health needs, and the eligibility criteria are quite strict. There’s more information here about Continuing Care. Because it is not means-tested, and can fully fund care, it is worth checking whether your relative qualifies.

If a relative gets this funding, their other benefits will stop.

“Very few people get awarded this, but it is worth checking,” says Jeremy Davies, founder of care home-fees-planning group Symponia. Once your relative is awarded Continuing Care Funding, all other benefits will stop.

Self-funders can still claim other benefits though. These include Attendance Allowance, which Davies says often goes underclaimed, even though it is not means tested. Rates for this allowance change depending on how much care your relative needs. The lower rate is £55.65 a week and the higher rate is £82.10 a week.

You must normally have been ill for six months (unless you are terminally ill) before you can get Attendance Allowance, which is not means tested.

Pension Credit, which tops up income for older people, also often goes unclaimed. Pension credit comes in two parts, known as Guarantee Credit and Savings Credit, and your relative may be eligible for one or both. Savings Credit, is being phased out. Most people who reached State Pension age on or after 6 April 2016 won’t be eligible for Savings Credit, unless they are in a couple and the other member of the couple reached pension age before that date.

Guarantee Credit tops up weekly income to a guaranteed minimum level of £159.35 if you are single or £243.25 if you are in a couple.

Savings Credit is extra money if you’ve got some savings or your income is higher than the basic State Pension. If you are entitled to it, you could receive £13.20 extra per week if you’re single or £14.90 if you’re in a couple. However, once your relative sells his or her house to pay for care they may find they miss out on Savings Credit, as eligibility depends on having a relatively low amount of savings.

A new study has been criticised for suggesting that women are less intelligent than men.

Scientists concluded that men’s average intelligence quotient (IQ) is four points above women’s because their brains are typically larger.

But using IQ – which relies largely on symbolic logic – is a controversial measure of intelligence, as it's harder to apply to everyday life.

British neuroscientist Dr Adrian Owen has previously called IQ assessments "pretty meaningless".

The latest study was carried out by Erasmus University in Rotterdam and reignites the controversial debate about how to measure intelligence.

Historical bigotry has seen women denied the right to vote and own property, often on the basis that their brains were physically smaller, leading to the incorrect assumption that they are less intelligent.

But author and science journalist Angela Saini says this is not the case, and the latest study is part of a long-running attempt by male neuroscientists to undermine women.

Ms Saini, who has written a book on how science underestimated the intelligence of women, told The Sunday Times: "It is scientifically well established that there is no difference on average in general intelligence between women and men.

"It's also well known that women have, on average, slightly smaller brains than men because they are, on average, slightly smaller in size. This paper does not disprove these facts.

"For more than 100 years, male anatomists and neuroscientists have sought to find evidence of women's intellectual inferiority by comparing their brains to those of men.

"It's surprising that in the 21st century those efforts haven't ended."

Van der Linden and his colleagues used detailed MRI scans of people aged between 22 and 37 to measure the volume of their brains and the areas of their cerebral cortex which are linked to conscious thoughts and actions.

The IQ of each participant was also measured. The team found that men had an average brain volume of 1.2 litres compared with 1 litre for women, and that people with bigger brains had slightly higher IQ scores.

However, some studies have shown that EQ – emotional intelligence – is a more effective indicator of success in the workplace and wider life. Women typically score higher than men on this measure.

路透柏林6月27日 - 美国商务部长罗斯周二表示，如果贸易伙伴国不能就钢铁倾销问题帮助找到共同解决方案，美国除了寻求“大规模”举措来应对外可能别无选择。

罗斯在柏林参加一场经济活动时表示，在这种情况下，那些本来不是倾销直接来源的国家可能会面临困境。

他没有具体说明总统特朗普将采取哪些举措来解决钢铁业产能过剩问题。在美国政府看来，这是一个重要问题，称其希望让美国贸易关系更公平。

“如果总统特朗普就倾销问题采取行动，希望会促使进口国采取集体解决方案，”罗斯对默克尔所在的保守派基督教民主党(CDU)成员表示。

“由于缺少与伙伴国强有力的联合行动，我们可能别无选择，只能自己行动，”他说。“如果我们这样做，或许会是大规模的举措。”

罗斯此前曾表示，他希望在6月末前完成对美国钢铁产业的国家安全调研，此举或带来全面的钢铁进口限制新规。

美国商务部正在启用冷战时期的一部贸易法案，可允许总统对被视为重要国防用途的特定产品和材料实行进口限制。

尚不确定调研结果的出炉时间以及相关的后续行动。

特朗普政府官员周二早些时候告诉路透，特朗普对中国在朝鲜和双边贸易问题上无作为感到越来越沮丧，现正考虑对华采取贸易行动，包括对钢铁进口加征关税等。

美国原已对中国的钢材征收了多项反倾销和反补贴税，导致中国在美国钢铁市场上的直接份额大受影响。本次国家安全调研推出的新限制措施，或将对来自德国、日本和韩国等美国盟友的钢材产生更大影响。

罗斯在会上还提及，在药品、化学品和运输等其它领域，美国对欧盟的贸易赤字尤其巨大，但他表示双方应协作应对第三方国家的倾销行为。

罗斯发言后，默克尔对他有关恢复美欧贸易协议相关工作的呼吁表示欢迎，但强调德国的在美投资是美国就业岗位的重要来源。(完)

“So what’s this surprise then?”

“You’ll see in a minute.”

Excited as a child, trying to wheedle the details of the day’s excursion out of my long-suffering beau as we enter the idyllic grounds of Lingholm Estate – famously the childhood holiday home of Beatrix Potter – I shield my eyes from the sun and look up. And see something truly astonishing.

Fifty metres ahead waits a man wearing wellies and a tweed flat cap over his flaming red hair. That isn’t what’s astonishing – it’s pretty standard dress code for nearby Keswick, the pretty Lake District town where we’ve been staying for the last few days. No, what’s taken me aback is his two companions: a couple of joyously adorable alpacas.

“Surprise!” The boyfriend looks at me with a grin as I splutter in shock. Of all the things I was expecting, this wasn’t one of them.

“What…? How…?” I stumble forward in awe, staring lovingly at the creatures before me and immediately anthropomorphising them: “They’re smiling!”

(They’re not.)

The man turns out to be Terry, former soldier turned breeder and entrepreneur, who in just four short years has grown his herd from a couple of alpacas to over 40. He has no background in farming but learnt the trade as he went along, asking breeders for advice and doing research online.

“Here you go, this is Jake,” says Terry, handing me a lead attached to the white fluffy specimen on his left. I cling on, half delighted, half terrified, as he informs me that this is Jake’s first time out of the paddock – he’s never been walked by a stranger before.

Beatrix Potter's holiday home provides the perfect backdrop (Oliver Jarvis )

“Won’t he be nervous?” I ask, covering for the fact that I’m a tad nervous myself.

“Nah, he’ll be fine. Probably. You can’t tell whether they’ll like it until you get them out on the lead, so we’ll see.”

Terry hands the other alpaca, a gorgeous auburn beast called Bradley, to my partner and explains to us that we can pet them, but only in certain places. “Stroke them on the side of the neck – but don’t touch them on the back. It makes them anxious.”

I gulp. Got it, no back-touching.

Lingholm Estate backs onto Derwentwater (Oliver Jarvis )

There’s really no need to be scared though – Terry is quick to inform us that our charges’ top teeth have been trimmed, so they can give us a nip but it won’t do any damage.

Adding that alpacas make different sounds to indicate their mood – when they hum it means they’re contented – the perpetually laid-back Terry beckons us forward to begin our tour of the estate’s private grounds.

Alpacas aside, booking this experience provides an innovative loophole in the law of the manor. Only parts of Lingholm Estate are open to the public – namely The Lingholm Kitchen café, a smattering of public footpaths and the walled garden that provided Ms Potter with the inspiration for Peter Rabbit’s adventures with Farmer McGregor. But the actual house and grounds behind are privately owned by boy-done-good millionaire businessman David Seymour, who bought the estate in 2014: “He’s a decent lad,” Terry tells us. The only way you can walk freely around the grounds is by staying on the estate in one of the 11 accommodation options, ranging from bijoux apartments to sizeable houses – or by taking an alpaca for a walk.

Taking a selfie with an alpaca is harder than it looks (Oliver Jarvis)



The latter is infinitely more entertaining. As we tentatively take our first steps with our new best friends, I’m torn between gazing in wonder at Jake’s jovial face and gazing in wonder at the magnificent grounds. The house is perfectly positioned at the top of a gentle slope leading down to Derwentwater, providing an unbeatable view of what I consider to be the Lake District’s most beautiful body of water.

We soon warm up to our companions, gently leading them across the path, trying to discourage them from eating every blade of grass in sight. In no time I hear the unmistakable vibrations of a hum: “It’s Jake! He loves me!”

Terry gives us his patter as we walk, telling us about how he built up the business from nothing; in addition to alpaca walks, he makes a tidy profit from selling their fleece, coveted for its softness. He throws in some ghoulish Beatrix Potter facts that were conveniently left out of the movie – apparently she chloroformed and stuffed animals as a child so she could draw them more accurately. Nice.

Terry takes the alpacas for a dip (Oliver Jarvis )

We make our way down to the water’s edge at a leisurely pace, pausing every now and then for Terry to capture a few snaps of us as a memento. When we reach the shore, he encourages us to take a selfie with our alpacas: it’s much trickier than it sounds, as they move their heads this way and that in diva-like fashion.

I sigh contentedly as I stand looking over the tranquil beauty of Derwentwater while Jake the alpaca nuzzles into the sleeve of my coat (there’s a sentence I never thought I’d write). How could life get better than this?

Moving on, we come to a rope swing tied to a tree, which was reportedly a favourite hangout of Beatrix’s. “Fancy a swing?” asks Terry. Do I?!

I push off, hoping for the inspiration and creativity of Britain’s most lauded children’s author to filter through the years and take root in my head. Ooh, imagine if a hedgehog did laundry – wait, that’s already been done. Oh well.

The hour passes ludicrously quickly, and before I know it we’ve circled back around to the field where Terry keeps some of his herd. I look down sadly at Jake – I can’t bear to be parted from him already.

And it turns out I don’t have to. “Come on, it’s feeding time,” shouts Terry. He brings a big bucket of feed, pouring pellets into our outstretched palms so that alpacas trot over and snuffle their soft snouts against our fingers. We spend a busy half-hour ensuring everyone has had their fill before it really is time to go.

“Goodbye Jake,” I say softly, stroking his neck as I imagine I see his clear blue eyes welling up with tears.

(They’re not).

And then I chloroform and stuff him, Potter-style, so our love will never die.

Just kidding.

Travel essentials

A 90-minute long alpaca walk around Lingholm Estate for two people costs £60. Children under 8 can walk for free (sharing an alpaca with a paying adult).

An iconic hotel that's played host to stars including Beyoncé and Jay Z, Princess Diana and Dodi al Fayed, Elton John, Grace Kelly and Robbie Williams, Cala di Volpe on Sardinia’s exclusive Costa Smeralda is perhaps best known as one of the locations where Roger Moore was filmed as James Bond in The Spy Who Loved Me.

Despite the all-star status, luxury is discreet here. Built in the style of an ancient Italian fishing village, you'd be forgiven for thinking Cala di Volpe is centuries old. With its terracotta-tiled roofs and ombré walls painted in pastel shades of pink, orange and yellow, its rustic style harkens back to a simpler time – but in fact it only opened in 1962.

It may be understated, but this is still an exclusive hotel; I relish the decadence of hopping aboard the private five-minute shuttle boat, complimentary for hotel guests, that whisks me to a secluded beach around the corner. It’s nice to get the celebrity treatment once in a while, even when you’re not Beyoncé. For those who prefer to stay in their depth, the hotel boasts a huge saltwater pool, plus an indoor and outdoor gym.

Cala di Volpe has views over a quiet bay (Cala di Volpe)

And I’m tempted to make use of the work-out facilities after being plied with cuttle-fish ink spaghetti and Sardinian roasted pork, both exceptional, at the hotel’s main restaurant. Breakfast is served here too - I indulged in traditional Sardinian cakes, freshly-baked bread and mozzarella, with a side of exquisite views of the private harbour. There’s another eatery on site, too – the more informal outdoor Barbecue Restaurant, offering a colourful Mediterranean buffet and a more dressed-down feel.

This is a place where people come to see and be seen, and everything is Instagram-worthy – including the signature bellinis, made with fresh white peaches and best enjoyed on the hotel terrace as the sun sets. Cala di Volpe isn’t short of bars to savour a drink at, with four to choose from including the trendy Atrium bar, which serves up cocktails complemented by views across the bay.

There's a selection of designer shops on the hotel’s ground floor, which gives you an idea of the type of clientele Cala di Volpe attracts. About a third of the guests are well-heeled Italians, and moneyed Americans and Brits flock here too to soak up the sun.

Location

Located on the Costa Smeralda on the northern coast of Sardinia, Cala di Volpe is just a half-hour drive from Olbia airport, a two and a half hour flight from London Gatwick. The hotel provides a free deluxe minivan shuttle service to ferry guests to and from the airport.

Costa Smeralda translates as the Emerald Coast, named for the distinctive deep green colour of the sea along this 55km stretch of coastline. I can confirm it lives up to the name – the water manages to be both clear and an eye-catching shade of jade simultaneously, striking a stark contrast with the pale blue of the cloudless sky.

Cala di Volpe – or Bay of Foxes – feels completely secluded. It’s set next to a quiet bay so still it feels like a lake, with a tucked-away stretch of sand accessible by the speed boat shuttle that comes every half hour. I was happy to relax and enjoy the surroundings, but for those who fancy venturing further afield there are plenty of other beaches and coves to explore in the area.

Comfort

Rustic whimsy meets all-out luxury at Cala di Volpe – I find the simple white sheets of my king-sized bed graced with a Lindt chocolate after turn down, the colourfully tiled bathroom is stocked with premium Acqua Di Parma toiletries, and the roughly hewn white stucco walls are adorned with a large flat-screen television in addition to the more traditional Sardinian arts and crafts.

There’s high-speed wifi, a business centre and even sockets on the balconies for those who’d prefer to work with a view of the turquoise bay and surrounding verdant greenery.

Cala di Volpe's bedroom are charmingly rustic (Cala di Volpe)

Ranging from singles to doubles to suites, the hotel’s 121 rooms are gratifyingly spacious – particularly the one three-bedroom presidential suite, complete with private rooftop and swimming pool. Not that I’m staying there. After all, I’m not really Queen Bey.

If this were high stakes blackjack, Warren Gatland would be holding a pair of kings in his hand right now, content with the cards he has been dealt and letting his poker face do the talking. His opposite number, Steve Hansen, is not so comfortable at the table, as he has a pair of fives, but the All Blacks coach is ready to twist in the hope of receiving the ace he needs to wrestle back the advantage in this intriguing British and Irish Lions tour of New Zealand.

That’s because where Lions coach Gatland has been able to name an unchanged line-up, a first for the tourists in 24 years, Hansen has decided the revamp his back-line. His hand has been partly forced by the suspension of Sonny Bill Williams following his red card last weekend, but rather than put his faith just in the untested Ngani Laumape, Hansen has elected to throw two players in at the deep end by also handing Jordie Barrett his first international start.

It’s a massive gamble by the World Cup winner. The loss of Ben Smith and Ryan Crotty to concussion and a hamstring injury respectively has significantly hampered the All Blacks’ cause during this Test series, and rather than stick with the power game that they have surprisingly resorted to in the first two matches, Hansen has put his faith in young Jordie to bring the flair and dazzling rugby that he has displayed for the Hurricanes this season.

British and Irish Lions player ratings vs All Blacks second Test







30 show all British and Irish Lions player ratings vs All Blacks second Test

























































1/30 Israel Dagg – 6 out of 10 Dropped the first high ball he had to field that was a sign of things to come. Struggled with the conditions and will not have expected to face so much coming his way. AFP/Getty Images

2/30 Waisake Naholo – 5 out of 10 Ran at times like a headless chicken as he followed the defenders rather than the ball. Did well to take an early cross-field kick, but suffered a head injury and didn’t return. Getty Images

3/30 Anton Lienert-Brown – 5 out of 10 Little impact on his return to the side. Had one good run in the second half but did little else of note. Getty Images

4/30 Sonny Bill Williams – 3 out of 10 Rightly sent-off for an intentional shoulder charge to the head of Watson that was meant to hurt him. First All Black to be sent-off since 1967. Getty Images

5/30 Rieko Ioane – 5 out of 10 Wasn’t given the chances to make an impact as he was in Auckland and didn’t come off his wing enough to find work. Getty Images for NZR

6/30 Beauden Barrett – 6 out of 10 Struggled with his goal kicking as he missed three penalties that ultimately cost the All Blacks the game. Passing was accurate and he swept back well when the ball was kicked in behind. Moved to full-back for the second weekend in a row. Getty Images

7/30 Aaron Smith – 6 out of 10 Wasn’t given the easy ride that he had at Eden Park, and the pressure affected his performance. His kicking was slightly off-target. Getty Images

8/30 Joe Moody – 7 out of 10 Enjoyed a good battle with Tadhg Furlong that left them both equal in the scrum. Didn’t carry as well as his opposite man, though his defending was good. Getty Images

9/30 Codie Taylor – 7 out of 10 Did incredibly well to soldier on after taking a knock midway through the first half and didn’t come off until the final minute. Lineout was much stronger this week and he should take credit for his throwing. Getty Images

10/30 Owen Franks – 7 out of 10 Probably edged his battle with Vunipola but his removal gave the Lions the edge in the pack. Wonder if Steve Hansen’s preference to replace both props at the same time has cost him. Getty Images for NZR

11/30 Brodie Retallick – 6 out of 10 Not as effective as the first Test as the Lions won that physicality battle. Penalised twice by Jerome Garces at the breakdown. Getty Images

12/30 Sam Whitelock – 6 out of 10 Came off second best in the battle of the second rows. Jumped well in the lineout. Getty Images

13/30 Jerome Kaino – 5 out of 10 The unfortunate casualty of Williams’ red card as he was removed to allow Ngani Laumape to fill the gap in the centres. Getty Images

14/30 Sam Cane – 7 out of 10 A presence again at the breakdown and won a penalty within 10 minutes when he got over Watson. Put in a big tackle on Farrell to make sure the centre knew he was watching him, and probably the All Blacks’ best performer. Getty Images

15/30 Kieran Read – 6 out of 10 Should take credit for running the lineout to a 90 per cent success ratio, but he was not as prominent in the loose as last weekend. Getty Images

16/30 Lions: Liam Williams – 7 out of 10 Knocked the first box-kick forwards but posed problems for the All Blacks with his strong chasing off restarts. Smart pass gave Faletau the chance to score the opening try. Getty Images

17/30 Anthony Watson – 6 out of 10 Wore a heavy blow to the head in Sonny Bill Williams’ red-card tackle. Struggled for space as he had to cut-back on the switch twice, one of which saw him penalised when he met Sam Cane. Gaps just aren’t breaking in his favour, though made a good break late in the game. Getty Images

18/30 Jonathan Davies – 7 out of 10 Straightened the line usefully with the final play of the first half that led to a penalty. Kept his head late on to clear the ball immediately when in trouble. Getty Images

19/30 Owen Farrell – 8 out of 10 Looked much happier with the extra time he was offered at 12. Will have been relieved to see Williams depart early, and grew into the game as it wore on. While Barrett felt the pressure, Farrell missed just one conversion and kicked the match-winning penalty. Getty Images

20/30 Elliot Daly – 6 out of 10 Very quiet as the weather kept the ball away from his wing. Showed good awareness to retreat when All Blacks’ spotted space, but lengthy kick rolled dead to hurt the Lions. Getty Images

21/30 Johnny Sexton – 7 out of 10 Overcooked one kick that rolled dead but had a nice one into space that put Ioane under pressure. Began to get his trademark loop going with Farrell that brought some success, though dropped a high ball when he appeared to panic. Getty Images

22/30 Conor Murray – 7 out of 10 Given much more time on the ball though he took his time to come into the game. Took his moment brilliantly though to spot a gap and surge through to score. Getty Images

23/30 Mako Vunipola – 5 out of 10 Singled out for first penalty of the match when he collapsed the scrum, though Barrett’s poor kick let him off the hook. Lost his head when he conceded two penalties in three minutes for dangerous play. Guilty of being penalised four times. AFP/Getty Images

24/30 Jamie George – 8 out of 10 Saw two lineouts go astray but carried well, not least when his surge set Murray up for his try, and put in a huge 80 minute shift that should not be knocked at Test level. AFP/Getty Images

25/30 Tadhg Furlong – 7 out of 10 Impactful run early in the match as he took two All Blacks defenders with him in to the 22. Came off equal with Franks in an intriguing scrum battle and replaced by Kyle Sinckler midway through the second half. Getty Images

26/30 Maro Itoje – 8 out of 10 The Test match animal that the Lions have been waiting for. Phenomenal in defence as he stole the ball and disrupted All Blacks’ possession. Started like a house on fire, and he would have scored a nine had he not started leaking penalties in the second half. Getty Images

27/30 Alun Wyn Jones – 8 out of 10 Much better start to the match and rewarded Gatland for his faith in him. Delivered what was expected of him and carried much stronger this week. Looked like the Lion he is famous for in past tours. Getty Images

28/30 Sam Warburton – 7 out of 10 Good offload released Jones in the first half and dogged work at the breakdown slowed All Blacks’ ball that left opposite skipper Read frustrated. Getty Images

29/30 Sean O’Brien – 7 out of 10 Helped Sexton and Farrell by defending in-between them and carried brilliant as he took the fight to the All Blacks. Struggled to turn ball over but otherwise faultless. Getty Images

30/30 Taulupe Faletau – 8 out of 10 Popped up when it mattered most to score the first try and did exceptionally well to hold off Dagg and score. Carried well off the base. Getty Images

He is the youngest of three brothers named in the matchday squad, with Beauden at fly-half and Scott on the bench as the replacement lock. Yet he proved he can mix it with the Lions after starring in the 31-31 draw for the Canes last week in Wellington, and if he can bring his running boots with him on Saturday, Jordie could well be the man who does the most damage to the Lions – not to mention he is a better goal-kicker than big brother Beauden.

Lions Diary: Jared Payne ruled out of tour

However, the weather forecast again suggests that running rugby may not be the order of the day in Auckland this weekend, and do not be surprised if images of Gatland leading his squad through a rain dance emerge over the next 48 hours.

The Lions have been the side that have adapted to conditions much better over the series, and he has unsurprisingly kept faith with the side that secured a 24-21 victory last time out at Westpac Stadium.

The key for the tourists will be to see how quickly they can regain their focus. While the All Blacks made an immediate return to the training field to right the wrongs of their second Test performance, the Lions ventured to Queenstown for some rest and recovery, though that can also be read as bungee jumping, jet boating and booze.

It’s a plan that has worked for the Lions under Gatland, given they won the third Test in 2009 and 2013 after similar trips. But if the players do not hit the ground running this weekend, there will be plenty of questions about why the squad were living it up in Queenstown rather than knuckling down in Auckland.

The row between Jeff Hendrick and another man was just “drunken handbags”, a court has been told.

Mr Hendrick, 25, the Ireland footballer, and his co-accused, Jonathan Doran, 26, deny charges of committing violent disorder outside a nightclub in 2013. Mr Doran also denies assault.

Darren McDermott told Dublin circuit criminal court that Mr Hendrick dragged him from a taxi outside the club in Harcourt Street, Dublin on October 12, 2013 shortly after a verbal row inside the club. He said that he had ended up on the ground and received kicks to his head, face, chest and back.

He is now suing the footballer and the nightclub for damages.

Under cross-examination by Sean Gillane, SC, defending Mr Hendrick, Mr McDermott said he could not…

Turkey's Minister for EU Affairs Omer Celik reacts during an interview with Reuters in Ankara, Turkey, March 14, 2017. REUTERS/Umit Bektas

ANKARA Turkey rejects any proposals to drop European Union accession talks in favour of cooperation in other areas, its EU Affairs Minister Omer Celik said on Thursday ahead of a European Parliament vote on suspending Turkey's membership bid.

Speaking during a visit to Ankara by EU enlargement commissioner Johannes Hahn, Celik said it was wrong for EU lawmakers to call for the suspension of Turkey's membership talks, adding such approaches would benefit neither side.

"We reject with the back of our hand any proposals that there should be strong cooperation between Turkey and the EU in other areas instead of accession talks," Celik told reporters.

On Wednesday, EU lawmakers called for a suspension of Turkey's membership talks with the European Union, saying President Tayyip Erdogan's crackdown on opponents meant Ankara did not meet the bloc's democratic criteria.

A vote on the proposal is expected to pass comfortably on Thursday, but the parliament has limited influence on the issue. The European Commission and EU governments have ignored calls for a formal suspension of a process already in limbo.

Turkey's ties with its European allies have deteriorated since last July's abortive putsch, with Turkey accusing some European states of not showing enough support.

"The European Parliament has failed in its solidarity with Turkey following the coup attempt. We had expected strong support, but the call to end membership talks instead is wrong," Celik said.

Relations soured further in the run-up to an April 16 referendum that narrowly handed Erdogan sweeping presidential powers, as tensions between Turkey and the bloc escalated when some European states barred Turkish ministers from delivering speeches to drum up support ahead of the vote.

In an interview on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus told Reuters that Turkey was not responsible for the escalation of tensions between the two sides.

"Europe displaying inappropriate behaviour towards Turkey is not a situation we can accept. Being against our President Erdogan is also not a rational stance from Europe. Europe must decide: ... do they really want to enlarge?" Kurtulmus said.

EU commissioner Hahn said he hoped the interaction between the two sides would lead to a higher level of political dialogue.

"I don't know what will be decided, but I have to stress that the European Parliament is one of the institutions elected by the European citizens. Members of the European Parliament represent the view of their voters," Hahn said.

Kurtulmus said he believed sincere negotiations between the two parties would help resolve issues, and that Europe should take notice of the helping hand Turkey has extended.

EU leaders have been critical of Erdogan and his behaviour towards opponents, both before and after the abortive coup. But they do not want to undermine an agreement struck last year whereby Turkey effectively stopped migrants reaching Greece, easing a crisis that had threatened EU unity.

Celik said Turkey had noted the bloc's criticism regarding its judiciary and freedom of press and expression, but added the EU was blocking the process by not opening new chapters.

The White House and a pair of influential conservative advocacy groups have endorsed a proposal by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) that would allow health insurers to offer cheaper, less-comprehensive plans as long as they also offered at least one plan that includes the essential consumer protections required by the Affordable Care Act. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has sent Cruz's proposal to the Congressional Budget Office for cost-benefit analysis.

Wednesday's endorsement of the Cruz amendment by the leaders of FreedomWorks and the Club for Growth "is significant: Without at least a neutral stance from conservative groups, it could be impossible for McConnell to find the 50 votes needed to pass a repeal this month," Politico reports. "But what the right is asking for may not be able to pass the Senate." The proposal may well violate budget rules that McConnell is using to push through his bill with 51 votes, and more centrist senators and outside insurance experts are concerned that it would essentially price people with pre-existing conditions and other high medical needs out of the insurance market.

"People who have higher health-care needs and need more comprehensive coverage would choose ACA-compliant plans," said Cori Uccello at the American Academy of Actuaries. "People who are healthy now would tend to choose noncompliant plans with really basic benefits. People who want or need more comprehensive coverage could find it out of their reach, because it might become unaffordable." Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who was frequently thanked during July 4 festivities for helping at least slow down the bill, agreed that the Cruz language "would lead to adverse selection in the marketplace," adding: "It would also vitiate the important consumer protection of having a prohibition against annual and lifetime caps" on benefits.

Cruz and his allies argue that the amendment would lower premiums and allow individual consumers to essentially opt out of ObamaCare, but touching the pre-existing condition language may be a deal-breaker for other Republicans. "Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee is speaking against it in caucus lunches and Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska, a staunch conservative, also vocally opposes Lee and Cruz's idea," Politico says. "Many senators believe that the House made a critical error by allowing states to opt out of pre-existing condition protections and are determined not to touch that part of ObamaCare." A Senate vote could come as early as next week. Peter Weber

Floors swimming in nastiness at a Chengdu hospital, open-to-your-neighbours squat toilets at a Beijing restaurant, and cubicles without doors at a theme park in Kunming: just three of the bathroom nightmares experienced by The Independent’s travel desk in the last two years in China.

But such unexpected delights may be a thing of the past, since last week the Chinese government announced its much trumpeted “toilet revolution” is nearly 90 per cent complete, a year ahead of schedule.

In January 2015, China’s National Tourist Administration pledged to build 33,500 new public toilets around the country, focusing on tourist sites. An additional 25,000 were slated for renovation under a three-year plan.

Last week, the CNTA announced that almost 36,000 toilets have been installed and 15,000 renovated. It’ll be a relief for President Xi Jinping, who had personally approved the scheme – as well as for the 4.4b tourists who visit China’s sights every year.

But the improved facilities have caused extra problems. Last month, Beijing authorities installed facial recognition software at the public toilets in the city’s Temple of Heaven Park, in order to combat an increasing problem of people stealing toilet paper, which is rarely on offer at public facilities.

Now, anyone entering the toilets must undergo a facial scan and be allocated a 60cm strip of paper. The system then bars them from requesting more paper within a nine-minute period. Paper use has dropped from 20 rolls per day to just four since the software was installed, according to China Radio International. Most visitors seem to approve – although one man, Wang Jianquang complained to the New York Times that “the sheets are too short.”

Most toilets at the country’s main tourist attractions have now been upgraded, according to Li Jinzao, head of the CNTA – and lesser known sites are now on the agenda. Hopefully before too long, the revolution will reach Kunming.

Cruz and his allies argue that the amendment would lower premiums and allow individual consumers to essentially opt out of ObamaCare, but touching the pre-existing condition language may be a deal-breaker for other Republicans. "Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee is speaking against it in caucus lunches and Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska, a staunch conservative, also vocally opposes Lee and Cruz's idea," Politico says. "Many senators believe that the House made a critical error by allowing states to opt out of pre-existing condition protections and are determined not to touch that part of ObamaCare." A Senate vote could come as early as next week. Peter Weber

British football is braced for a wide-ranging crackdown on tax avoidance, including investigations into potential abuse of the “image rights” loophole, after HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) won its long-running case against Rangers at the Supreme Court yesterday.

After a long-running appeal process, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in HMRC’s favour over Rangers’ use of employee benefit trusts (EBTs), whereby more than £47 million was paid to players, managers and directors in tax-free loans, via trust funds in Jersey, between 2001 and 2010. The offences were committed by a previous regime and at a previous company, since Rangers were liquidated and reformed in 2012, but yesterday’s judgement represents another low in the Scottish club’s inglorious recent history.

Responding to the verdict, HMRC warned of “wide-ranging…

Facebook is due to start hiding posts from people who spam users' news feed with clickbait, sensationalised and misinformative articles.

In a statement, the social media giant said it was making the update "to reduce low quality links" in users' news feed.

Facebook said it carried out research which showed that a small group of users were "routinely sharing vast amounts of public posts per day", which was effectively spamming people's feeds.

The study showed that the same people, who were sharing vast amounts of public posts, were also sharing low quality content.

As a result of the research, Facebook said it would "deprioritise" posts being shared from those accounts.

The new policy will only apply to links for individual articles and domains - pages, videos, photos, check-ins or status updates will not be affected.

Facebook said it aimed to make people's news feed more "informative".

It said: "By taking steps like this to improve news feed, we’re able to surface more stories that people find informative and reduce the spread of problematic links such as clickbait, sensationalism and misinformation."

Meanwhile, Facebook is also reported to be rolling out a new Discover tab for Messenger that will make it easier for users to find and engage with brands and chatbots, Business Insider reports.

The tool, which was unveiled during a Facebook conference in April, is part of the company's strategy to make Messenger a go-to communication platforms between users and businesses.

The social network said it wants to make the app more like the Yellow Pages and make it easier for users to get in touch with businesses.

While users will be able to use the Discover tab to "find the businesses they care about", this will also mean businesses will also be able to pester users more easily.

Activity among the UK's builders slowed by more than expected in June according to the latest survey snapshot of the sector.

The Purchasing Managers' Index came in at 54.8 in the month, down from 56 in May and lower than the 55 City of London analysts had pencilled in.

Any reading above 50 signals growth.

All three of the main construction sectors - housebuilding, commercial and civil engineering - slowed in the month.

Measures of business optimism hit their lowest levels of the year so far.

"Survey respondents commented on renewed caution among clients, in response to heightened political and economic uncertainty," said Tim Moore, senior economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the PMI.

June's construction reading follows a bigger than expected June slowdown in manufacturing reported by the PMI Monday.

Construction accounts for around 6 per cent of UK GDP and manufacturing 10 per cent.

The services sector PMI, which covers the rest of the economy, will be released on Wednesday.

The building sector grew by 1.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2017, while the wider economy slowed to just 0.2 per cent GDP growth, according to the Office for National Statistics.

"The average level of the PMI in Q2 is consistent on past form with quarter-on-quarter growth in construction output of about 0.5 per cent in Q2," said Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon.

"The official measure of output in April, however, was 1.5 per cent below its Q1 average, so unless the data are revised significantly the construction sector likely dragged on GDP growth in Q2."

Official statistics show the construction sector expanded by 2.4 per cent in 2016 as a whole, following a 4.5 per cent expansion in 2015 and 8 per cent in 2014.

However, the level of construction output level still remains below its peak in 2007.

The financial markets have been rocked by Donald Trump’s victory in the US election, but what are the president elect’s policies?

After a long and bitter campaign for the US presidency, Donald Trump has triumphed over Hillary Clinton and the world’s financial markets have been rocked.

For Trump’s supporters he represents a chance to shake up a system that many Americans feel has increased inequality and squeezed living standards. For less complacent investors, there are worries Trump’s anti-globalisation mantra will spread protectionism around the world, put up trade barriers and curb global economic growth. Furthermore, markets do not like unknowns and with Trump going to the White House they are dealing with a complete newcomer to politics. His administration is widely expected to mark a departure from the policies of his own Republican party as well as the outgoing Democrats.

So what do we know about Trump’s economic policies? We look at the key areas:

Trade

Tapping into economic discontent Trump has argued for protectionism and asserted that decades of free-trade policies were responsible for the collapse of the American manufacturing industry. He has been feeding on the perception among many Americans that globalisation has brought more pain than gain, for example, by bringing cheap consumer goods into the country, costing domestic jobs and depressing wages. Outsourcing of jobs to cheaper markets has also been a concern. Against that backdrop, Trump’s stance on trade is perhaps the clearest of his economic policies.

The billionaire Republican wants to renegotiate, or possibly even scrap, the North American Free Trade Agreement. Nafta lowers trade barriers between the US, Canada and Mexico and was negotiated by George HW Bush and enacted in the 1990s by Bill Clinton. The incoming president wants Nafta to offer a better deal for Americans and has rejected claims by his opponents that the deal has helped the US economy by opening up export markets.

The protectionism with regard to Mexico does not stop there. One of Trump’s most notorious pledges in the presidential campaign was to build a multibillion-dollar wall along the US southern border and force Mexico to pay for it. On the markets on Wednesday fears over the blow to Mthe Mexican economy from Trump’s victory have sent the peso plummeting.

Other global trade deals are also now very much in doubt, notably the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), between 12 countries around the Pacific rim, excluding China, and the agreement being negotiated between the US and Europe, known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).

In terms of trade deals, both TTIP and the TPP now look dead in the water

Philip Shaw, an economist at the bank Investec, says: “While we are minded to disregard some of Mr Trump’s wilder pre-election rhetoric, we consider that there is a tangible risk that a Trump presidency could fuel anti-globalisation momentum and spark a wave of protectionist policies around the globe. In terms of trade deals, both TTIP and the TPP now look dead in the water.”

Trump has also made his anger with China over trade well known, arguing that since China joined the World Trade Organisation, Americans have witnessed the closure of more than 50,000 factories and the loss of tens of millions of jobs. He wants the US government to label China a “currency manipulator” and has lambasted the rapidly growing Asian economy for “unfair subsidy behaviour”.

Taxes

Here again, Trump has played into frustrations among many Americans over their sense of financial insecurity, inequality and squeezed incomes. Trump, who has faced fierce criticism for appearing to escape paying income tax himself for almost two decades, promised tax cuts for all income groups.



He has pledged “a massive tax reduction” for working and middle-income Americans and has vowed to eliminate income taxes for individuals who earn less than $25,000 annually, or $50,000 for a married couple. He has also said he would “ensure the rich pay their fair share”. But analysis by the conservative Tax Foundation has found Trump’s tax plan would disproportionately help the richest Americans, saving them millions.

Trump has also supported lower corporate taxes, proposing to cut the business tax rate from 35% to 15%. He wants to close special interest tax loopholes and to restrict companies from moving money out of the country. He has also proposed a corporate tax repatriation plan – to encourage US companies which hoard cash overseas to avoid paying the 35% tax to bring that cash back to the US. According to Capital Economics this cash hoard is now $2.5tn. A tax holiday – so the tax due would be only 10% for a period – could encourage corporations to bring back cash to invest or distribute to shareholders

Public finances

All those tax cuts mean less coming in to government coffers, at least in the near-term. There is an argument that the potential boost to businesses and to household spending power would lift the economy enough to improve government finances. But, for now, economists expect that Trump’s plans for tax cuts across the board will mean the US taking on more debt as its deficit – the gap between spending and income – swells.

Kevin Logan, the chief US economist at the bank HSBC, says: “Reducing the budget deficits, while cutting tax rates at the same time, will be difficult without sizable cutbacks in federal spending. If a Trump administration manages to push through tax cuts with matching spending cuts, federal budget deficits, which are already trending higher, will probably increase substantially, in our view.”

Obamacare

Trump wants to repeal and replace president Barack Obama’s healthcare plan, introduced under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), with his own, cheaper plan for tax-free health savings accounts (HSAs). On the campaign trail, Trump called Obamacare an expensive “disaster”.

About 20 million more people have insurance thanks to the ACA but the scheme has struggled to run efficiently because it relies on competition between insurers to provide affordable coverage, and that competition has dwindled.



Immigration

The most high-profile Trump plan on immigration is for a wall along the Mexican border. He also said he would deport 11 million undocumented migrants, something opponents say is physically impossible. He wants immigrants to be selected on the basis of “their likelihood of success in the US and their ability to be financially self-sufficient”.

Jobs and growth

Unemployment in the US has dropped below 5%, a good record on the surface for Obama. But during his campaign, Trump has focused on those parts of the economy and country where the recovery since the financial crash has not being felt, gaining traction with those Americans who have seen their industries diminish and their wages stagnate.

On the campaign trail, Trump chose the once booming industrial centre of Detroit to set out his economic plan. He cited the motor city’s higher-than-average unemployment rate and crime levels in a speech that played on widespread worries about the decline of US manufacturing.

Trump has said his protectionist policies will keep “jobs and wealth inside the United States” . He has promised to increase employment, saying his plans for lower taxes, trade barriers and tighter immigration rules would lead to stronger economic growth. As with the deficit, many economists warn his plans could make things worse not better, hindering economic growth and thereby employers’ ability to create new jobs.

Trump has bemoaned the deteriorating conditions of American infrastructure but has provided little detail on what big spending projects he would undertake. In his victory speech he said: “We are going to fix our inner cities, and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We’re going to rebuild our infrastructure ... and we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.”

Interest rates

This is not strictly an area for the government, given interest rates are set by the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, widely referred to as the Fed. But there were worries during the presidential race that a win for Trump would undermine its independence and the position of its chairwoman, Janet Yellen.

The president-elect has previously accused the Fed of keeping borrowing costs low to help president Obama and has said the central bank’s policies have created a “false economy”.

In April he said he would be inclined to replace Yellen. In an interview with Fortune magazine, Trump also said he “absolutely” backed efforts to diminish the Fed’s power. Yellen began a four-year term as Fed chairwoman under Obama in February 2014.

Fed policymakers had hinted at another rate rise in December, part of the slow process of bringing policy back to more normal levels after drastic measures to shore up the US economy during the global financial crisis. But investors now think a move next month is off the table given the shock to markets from Trump’s victory and the economic uncertainty that lies ahead.



In the longer-term, more spending and tax cuts from the government – in other words looser fiscal policy – could usher in tighter monetary policy with a more interest rate hikes from the Fed.

Climate change

Trump’s victory has sparked alarm and dismay among environmentalists fearful he will reverse many of the green measures introduced under Obama. Caroline Lucas, the co-leader of the UK’s Green party, described the Republican’s win as “a hammer blow for the fight against climate change”.

In the past the real estate mogul has dismissed global warming as an “expensive hoax”. Now his election to the US presidency has thrown the historic Paris agreement into uncertainty just days after it officially came into force. Trump has threatened to to withdraw the US from the deal to cut greenhouse gases, which took 20 years to negotiate.

By contrast, Trump has indicated he would promote coal, shale gas and oil and there are worries he will curb investment into renewable energy sources as well as funding for the Environmental Protection Agency. He has pledged to scrap regulations for America’s coal industry, a stance that won him the beleaguered sector’s support. It gave around $223,000 in support of Trump, compared with none for his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, according to a Reuters analysis.

The Reith Lectures: The Day Is for the Living (BBC Radio 4) | iPlayer

Ear Hustle (Radiotopia) | Radiotopia.fm

Chuck Berry: 40 Years On (BBC Radio 6 Music) | iPlayer

Hilary Mantel is witchy. She conjures up the past with impeccably precise language, but the result is magic: stranger than mere history, more resonant. And her voice! So high pitched, it’s as though a child savant is speaking. Or – yes – a sorcerer. Dumbledore talking with the voice of Dolores Umbridge. If Grayson Perry’s Reith Lectures were a version of standup comedy, Mantel’s are a long enchantment, the casting of a spell.

Last week, we heard Mantel give her first lecture, recorded in Manchester. She made jokes about wallpaper. She used her ordinary history – someone once told her: “I come from a long line of nobodies” and she thinks that of herself – and expanded it to explain how she does what she does. Her technique is to get as many facts right as she can, researching the period, checking details obsessively: then her imagination takes over. Real characters speak made-up words. They seem real. “The dead are invisible,” she said. “But they are not absent.” And, answering an audience question: “History is not science. It’s humanity.” Mantel’s mind is exceptional; her voice, too: to hear her speak is delicious.

It’s not often you hear someone like Mantel given voice on the radio: older, female, northern, falsetto. And Radiotopia’s new series, Ear Hustle, sells itself as letting us hear from people we don’t usually hear speak. It’s a podcast made and broadcast from inside San Quentin, the US prison north of San Francisco. Except… I seem to have heard and seen many, many series based inside US prisons. And the voices didn’t seem so different: mostly black men, with rumbling tones, gorgeous slang. What was different was what they spoke about. This, the opening episode of 10, was about “cellies”, or cellmates. One man was sharing with a man who wanted to kill him. Two brothers were initially overjoyed to be cellies together – and then… Co-presenter/producer Earlonne Woods, an inmate, spoke of how his cellmate had been released and he was on the look out for a new one. (Bear in mind that the cells are 4ft by 9ft, with bunk beds, lavatory and washbasin squashed in; cellies need to be able to get along.) Co-presenter/producer Nigel Poor, an artist (who is not in jail), pushed Woods on how he finds someone to share with and, in doing so, revealed her own prejudices and assumptions. Sensitive stuff, but funny, too.

Ear Hustle beat 1,536 other entries in a competition to become an official Radiotopia podcast. As a celebration, the network’s established sister programmes are offering their own incarceration-themed episodes, under the blanket title Doing Time. I recommend Squatters of the Lower East Side from 99% Invisible; Radio Diaries’ The Rubber Room; Mortified’s Mortified, Interrupted… try any one of them, you won’t be disappointed.

Another man who knew about the inside of a prison cell was Chuck Berry. On 6 Music, we were treated to a programme made by Anthony Wall, who interviewed Berry in the late 1970s and made a radio show from the tapes. At the time, no one wanted it. But when Berry died last March, Wall offered it to 6 Music, which rightly snapped it up. Berry spoke of music and poetry, of love. His music weaved in and out. A dreamy tribute.

Four Things to Watch for During Trump-Putin Meeting


~_~


London's Borough Market reopened this week, 11 days after the terror attack in which eight people were killed and 48 injured.

Now best known as one of the capital's major tourist attractions, this former wholesale trading ground has been around for hundreds of years - it is protected by a 1754 act of parliament that preserves it for public enjoyment "forever", says The Londist.

Despite the attacks, Borough Market will endure - and so it should: a more vibrant testimony to our historic, yet thoroughly modern and cosmopolitan capital you will not find.

The only question, then, is where to go and what to do now that its delights are once again on the menu. Here are The Week's picks.

Starting the day right

If you're in the area first thing in the morning, you'll probably be in need of a caffeine hit to kick-start your day. In which case, head straight to Monmouth Coffee.

Located opposite the market proper on its western side, Monmouth serves what John Ridding, chief executive of the nearby Financial Times, calls the "best coffee in London" - and you'll typically find the queues to prove it.

If you're after something more substantial, then not far away and perched in the rafters inside the market itself, is Roast.

This popular modern-British restaurant sources produce from the market's stallholders and serves "the best English breakfast in town", says Itamar Srulovich and Sarit Packer, of Honey & Co. We'll vouch for that.

Luscious lunches

Roast is a popular venue for breakfast meetings, but is also open for lunch and dinner - although it has plenty of competition.

Ridding says his regular lunch venues of choice are Brindisa, a Spanish tapas restaurant at the southern tip of the market looking out on to Borough High Street, and El Pastor, a Mexican taco bar a few doors down, opened last year by a team including famous foodie brothers Sam and Eddie Hart.

If you're in the mood for Italian, Jonathan Ford, FT city editor, recommends Padella, "the pasta joint owned by Jordan Frieda, the son of hairdresser to the stars, John Frieda". You'll find it a few doors up from Brindisa, near the Bedale Street entrance.

"Forget the delights of the upmarket restaurants, my true taste of Borough Market has to be the £6 prawn wrap from Applebee's," says the FT's Robert Shrimsley.

In fact, this is one of a number of more rustic options, which includes cheese toasties at Kappacasein, chips and dip at Elliot's cafe and a wild Highland venison burger at the Furness Food Hut - not to be missed.

A bit of shopping

Whether you arrived first thing or in time for lunch, you will be full by now - time for some shopping.

Among the most famous shops in Borough Market's recent history is Neal's Yard Dairy, which is next door to Monmouth and well known not only for its huge variety of cheeses, but also its characteristic yogurt.

Out to stock up for dinners at home? Then the Londonist points you to Turnips, "one of the very best greengrocers in the capital", located right in the heart of the market, baker Bread Ahead in the northern enclave, and the acclaimed butcher the Ginger Pig on the western fringe.

There are a huge number of other stalls selling everything from fresh fish to beautiful bouquets of flowers, but a The Week favourite is the baklava stand to be found in the eastern wing of the market, under the railway line just down the steps from London Bridge, at weekends.

Into the night

The fun doesn't stop when the stalls close - the market's restaurants are all open for dinner, which is when Black and Blue, on the western side of the market, steps into the spotlight.

And if you to turn your day into a night out, you've come to the right place.

Among the many pubs in the area are the Market Porter, over the road from Black and Blue, which is well known for the Harvey's Sussex Best beer - El Pastor co-owner James Somerville's "all-time favourite pint".

A few doors down is the friendly Wheatsheaf, which boasts a funky beer garden and fantastic pub grub, while inside the market, under the railway line, lies The Globe, underneath Bridget Jones's flat in Bridget Jones's Diary.

Outside the market and off Borough High Street is Katzenjammer, a German bierhall of which one of The Week's team has fond memories of his stag do. It also features a traditional "oom-pah" band at weekends.

Finally, what about a visit over the road to the George Inn, set slightly back from the road on Borough High Street? Owned by the National Trust, but managed by the Greene King brewery, it dates back to the 17th century and is the last remaining galleried pub in London.

And if you end up here, you're in good company. Charles Dickens visited this pub and even referred to it in his book Little Dorrit, which is perhaps the best recommendation of all as the market begins writing the next chapter in its story.

Manchester United unveiled their 2017/18 home kit earlier this week, leaving us a full complement of first strips for the season ahead.

Some clubs, like Liverpool, Stoke City and Leicester City offered us a preview of their latest numbers at the tail end of last season.

Others waited a while in order to organise glamorous unveilings, with Tottenham Hotspur’s first Nike-made strip showcased during a gig by north London grime artist AJ Tracey.

Chelsea, the Premier League champions, will also be wearing Nike shirts this season after ending a decade-long partnership with Adidas.

The American sportswear giants have been criticised in recent years for rigidly sticking to specific templates, so have they switched things up this time around?

Take a look at the gallery above to see how we rated each of this season’ Premier League home kits out of 10.

Do you agree with our ratings? Let us know in the comments.

Gold is everywhere in Rangoon. The skyline is dominated by the gilded dome of the 100-metre-high Shwedagon Pagoda. Gold temple bells chime at every corner. Worshippers pay their respects by layering gold leaf on temple-dwelling Buddhas. Shops are filled with dangling chains and ornate baubles. Yet despite a goldsmithing tradition dating back more than 2,000 years, 98 per cent of gold jewellery sold in Rangoon (also known as Yangon) is machine-made.

Today gold in Burma is more about currency than craft. “Political and economic instability has transformed gold into the only reliable currency,” says Natalie Ortiz crafts programme manager at NGO Turquoise Mountain. “People buy gold as an investment and they’re unwilling to pay for craftsmanship.” As a result the market is flooded with cheap jewellery aping designs from nearby China and India. Handmade filigree, open-wire work and indigenous motifs have, in recent years, been nearly impossible to find.

When Turquoise Mountain was planning to work with Aung Sang Suu Kyi’s Suu Foundation to reinvigorate the Burmese craft industry and renovate the capital’s decaying heritage buildings, it was a slog to find traditional workers. In 2015, senior designer Hla Thaung and Pippa Small, a London jewellery designer, scoured Rangoon for skilled artisans but found nobody. They widened the net again and again. Eventually their search took them to turbulent Rakhine state, where, on Ramree Island, they encountered a goldsmithing community with a precarious future.

Shelling out: Burmese artisans use seashells to cast gold (Turquoise Mountain)

Ramree’s goldsmiths belong to a tradition of producing coins reaching back to the sixth century; by 17th century they were also outfitting the royals of the Arakan kingdom (which ruled the area that’s now Rakhine state). The two designers found the men still working as they have done for generations – using seashells to cast and paying homage to Buddhist iconography as well as local flora and fauna in their motifs.

But the rise of machine-made jewellery has recently been killing their community with young islanders forgoing apprenticeships in favour of farming, fishing or menial labour abroad. One, Aung Chay, was about to emigrate to Japan to work as a dishwasher when Pippa Small and Hla Thaung came calling. He’d once been tipped as one of Ramree’s most promising goldsmiths but was unable to make a living either on the island or in Rangoon. It was time, he’d decided, to admit defeat.

Turquoise Mountain asked Aung Chay to return to Rangoon to head its one-man-band goldsmith’s studio. His mission: to reinterpret traditional Burmese designs for a contemporary market, something the NGO had done successfully with a similar venture in Kabul. This collection, though, had something else going for it.

“Burmese gold is extremely rich in colour,” Small tells The Independent. “And the Burmese have used unique, ancient techniques uninterrupted for hundreds of years.” It was the shell casting and handworked fish-scale motifs that drew her to Rakhine State, she says.

The inaugural Pippa Small for Turquoise Mountain collection, sold at Small’s Notting Hill HQ last year, an instant hit. In February Aung Chay moved out of the tiny studio and into a handsome colonial shophouse on Shwe Taung Tan, in the heart of Rangoon’s gold market area. He wasn’t alone, either: eight goldsmiths work in the new space, where they have their own foundry as well as a little shop of their own.

“I knew I could continue my work with pride,” says Aung Chay.

Gold fingers: NGO Turquoise Mountain saved Aung Chay from emigrating to Japan

Next up for Aung Chay and his colleagues is a collaboration with individual mining families through a union in Mandalay province. Starting next month, the project will support two communities in upgrading their mining practices, including abandoning the traditional use of mercury to isolate gold from rock and debris.

Although Burma is known for the quality of its gold, explains Natalie Ortiz, most of the country’s reserves are located in areas where poverty is endemic. While gold panning remains a vital source of income for many in the countryside, mercury poisoning is linked to the deteriorating health of the Irrawaddy River, and pollution of the flood plains north of Mandalay.

Turquoise Mountain’s “artisanal gold” will be shipped straight to Aung Chay and his colleagues, in order to make Burma’s first fully ethically produced line of gold jewellery. Another project will work with a women’s group in Mogok – a Mandalay village famous for its gems – to source semi-precious stones responsibly. While Burma has large reserves of sapphires, rubies and jade, most of the mines are controlled by military or foreign investors. Land-grabbing, tax evasion and human-trafficking are commonplace.

Ring the changes: initiative is bringing fair trade to Burma's jewellery industry (Turquoise Mountain)

“We knew early on that we had to start our own workshop [in order to] maintain standards,” says Ortiz. Turquoise Mountain artisans enjoy a safe working environment and fair pay, while the organisation is committed to sourcing fairly, without exploiting communities or the environment. That also explains why the prices may be more than you'd expect – while rings start from £120, pendants start from £900 and earrings from £160; necklaces are from £610 with each link crafted by hand. It may not be cheap and cheerful, but it’s certainly ethical.

In the light-filled workshop on Shwe Taung Tan, the Ramree goldsmiths are busy. Aung Chay is fusing gold beads on to a pair of earrings. Nearby, his brother-in-law puts the final touches on a pair shaped like jasmine flowers. An apprentice cuts a sheet of gold into strips that will be woven into the shape of a fish – the same technique that first attracted Small’s attention.

Visitors drop in now and then to gasp at the skilled craftsmanship which, a year ago, was in danger of disappearing. “When we met Aung Chay he was on his way to Japan,” says Ortiz. “How unfortunate for Burmese goldsmithing if he had.”

Turquoise Mountain Artisan Goldsmith Workshop takes visitors by appointment at 26 Shwe Taung Tan, Lanmadaw, Rangoon. Call: 00 95 1 540 198; facebook.com/turquoisemountainmyanmar. Open 10am-4pm. Email: sandar[AT]turquoisemountain.com to book.

Skoda's Kodiaq is one of the most important cars of 2017. It's a new budget SUV from the Volkswagen group and shares the same production platform as the second-generation Tiguan, which launched last year.

Skoda will offer the Kodiaq as a five-seater as standard, although two extra seats can be specced at an additional cost. Price-wise, at £21,765, it's a bit of a bargain, undercutting many of its key rivals by some margin.

The car has launched with a line-up of five engines, available in either petrol or diesel forms. Entry-level models are front-wheel drive, with all-wheel drive options available further up the range. There are also five trim levels to give buyers plenty of options for customising their car.

The Kodiaq represents a brand-wide push into the SUV market by Skoda. It will soon be joined by the smaller Karoq, while a high-performance vRS version is also expected.

For now, though, here's everything you need to know about Skoda's budget SUV.

Design

In looks alone, the production version of the Kodiaq barely differs from the concept car Skoda revealed at the Geneva Motor Show last year.

Compared to the Yeti, which has now been replaced by the Karoq SUV, the Kodiaq is a much more angular and purposeful-looking machine. The car has thin lights that merge seamlessly into its grille, while sharp creases run down its flanks. The wheel arches are squared off and the roofline slopes downward for a sporty look.

Skoda has designed the Kodiaq with short overhangs at the front and rear of the car, suggesting the SUV will have some off-road potential when equipped with the optional four-wheel drive system. This adds to the car's stocky but capable-looking aesthetic.

The Kodiaq is 15ft long, over six feet wide and 5.5ft tall. With a wheelbase of nine feet, it's the longest version of the Volkswagen Group's MQB production platform in a European car to date, although this could be superseded by the VW Tiguan Allspace over the coming months.

Interior

The look and feel of the cabin closely matches the firm's large family saloon car – the Superb – though the dashboard is chunkier, the infotainment system is placed higher up and the vertical style air vents are new. The cabin is finished in partial leather trim.

While a 6.5ins (16.5cm) touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto will come as standard, the real in-car tech highlights will be found on top-of-the-range models. They'll get an 8ins (20cm) screen as well as Infotainment Online, with real-time traffic updates for the satellite navigation system and wi-fi for phones, laptops and tablets.

A full list of optional extras and technologies has yet to be revealed, though a 360-degree camera system displaying the car's surroundings on the screen is available. This promises to make manoeuvring the Kodiaq in tight spaces a much easier task. Satellite navigation, a wireless charging box for smartphones, an electronic power-assisted tailgate and adaptive cruise control are other optional extras. An automatic emergency braking system is standard in all cars.

Practicality

The Kodiaq's long wheelbase should mean there's plenty of space inside. As standard, it's a five-seater with sliding and 60:40 split folding rear seats. An optional third row will take it to seven seats.

Five-seater models come with a cavernous 720 litres of boot space. Go for the seven-seat option and this is reduced to a still respectable 630 litres. Fold all of the rear seats down and the back opens up a 2,065-litre cargo bay.

Engines and drivetrain

There are five engines to choose from – two diesels and three petrols – as well as four wheel drive options and different gearboxes.

The diesels are both 2.0-litre units, one producing 148bhp and 251lb-ft of torque, the other slightly more powerful, with 187bhp and 295lb-ft.

Then there are two 1.4-litre petrol engines – a 123bhp option with 146lb- ft alongside a sprightlier 148bhp unit offering 148bhp and 184lb-ft. Above them sits a 2.0-litre with 177bhp and 236lb-ft.

The range-topping petrol and diesel options get a dual-clutch automatic gearbox and four-wheel drive by default, everything else is front-wheel drive as standard. The entry-level petrol car has a manual gearbox, while the rest of the range will be fitted with DSG – manual boxes can only be specced if you choose four-wheel drive.

Auto Express reports that the engine range is sure to increase over the coming months, as more powerful options become available. The magazine says that the 237bhp twin-turbo diesel power unit from the Volkswagen Passat will eventually find its way under the bonnet, though it could cost upwards of £40,000.

A hybrid powertrain could be on the cards too, though this version of the Kodiaq isn't expected to be on the market until 2019.

Efficiency and performance

Details here are still missing, but Skoda has given us a few hints on the new SUV's performance, as well as how efficient it is.

As expected, the cleanest model on sale will be the 148bhp diesel, which has a CO2 score of 131g/km. It'll cost £130 a year to tax when it launches.

If you'd prefer the slightly more powerful diesel engine with 187bhp, emissions will go up to 153g/km, representing a tax bill of £185. The car will perform better, however, and the 8.6 second 0-62mph time means it won't be sluggish.

At the top of the range, the 177bhp petrol is the quickest to 62mph, doing the dash in just 7.8 seconds. It'll be the most expensive to run and tax though, and the 171g/km CO2 emissions mean you'll pay £300 in tax for the first year the car is on the road.

Sportline and Scout

Skoda has announced two additions to the Kodiaq line-up, with sleeker Sportline and more rugged Scout models set to appear at the Geneva Motor Show next month.

The Sportline will feature several exterior styling tweaks, including model-specific body-coloured protective panelling and a gloss-black grille for a more premium feel.

Inside, the sporty theme continues with grippy Alcantara seats and aluminium covered pedals. A multifunctional steering wheel is included as standard, as are electronically adjustable wing mirrors and LED ambient lighting.

Buyers can choose between two diesel engines, available in 148bhp or 187bhp form, as well as a 148bhp and 178bhp petrol units.

The Scout, meanwhile, is a chunkier version of the Kodiaq SE, but only available with four-wheel drive.

Skoda has added several styling details inspired by modern off-roaders, such as silver front and rear bumpers that should offer drivers more protection in harsher conditions. There are also silver accents to the front grille, roof rails and wing mirrors.

Along with the all-wheel drive system come off-road assistance and a rough-road pack that protects the underbody. A selection of driving modes are also available as standard, allowing drivers to optimise the car for a variety of conditions.

Skoda will reveal more details about the Kodiaq Sportline and Scout at the Geneva show, which runs from 9 to 19 March. Prices have yet to be announced, but expect them to enter above the SE trim's £22,945 price tag.

Price and release

Pricing for the Kodiaq has now been confirmed and as expected, the SUV undercuts its key rivals by a fairly significant margin.

It’ll start from £21,495 for the most basic S-trim level, which comes with the 123bhp 1.4-litre petrol engine and a six-speed manual gearbox. Standard equipment includes LED daytime running lights, a touchscreen infotainment system with both DAB radio and Smartlink for smartphone integration, 17ins alloy wheels, keyless go, Front Assist emergency braking and a leather steering wheel.

If you want seven seats, you'll have to go up to SE trim, which starts from £22,945. The extra seats aren't standard – they're a £1,000 extra – but this trim level will offer the cheapest 4x4 Kodiaq, the 148bhp, 1.4-litre with a manual gearbox for £25,445, as well as the cheapest diesel option, for which pricing is yet to be confirmed. On SE cars, the larger eight-inch touchscreen comes as standard, as do 18ins alloy wheels, rear parking sensors, cruise control and dual-zone climate control.

SE L models come with seven seats as standard, plus sat nav, a powered tailgate, on-board Wi-Fi, Drive Mode Select, 19ins alloys, Alcantara upholstery and heated seats. Prices start at £28,525.

The Edition range-topper will be available at launch, with the likes of metallic paint, leather upholstery and a selection of driver assists as standard from £30,695.

If you're interested, you'll be able to spec your Kodiaq very soon – order books open next month and first deliveries take place in April 2017.

Rivals

The Kodiaq enters one of the most competitive markets in the car industry, with SUVs from the Kia Sorento to the Renault Koleos all offering lots of practicality for less than £30,000.

It sits on the same platform as the Volkswagen Tiguan, the company's mid-size crossover, which offers muscular styling and a high quality interior for £22,510. That's for a five-seater, making it smaller and more expensive than the entry-level Skoda.

However, VW is gearing up for the launch of a seven-seater model, expected to hit showrooms within the next couple of months. Autocar says prices will start at £26,000 - £2,000 more than the seven-seat Kodiaq.

Joining the market later this year is the Renault Koleos, the carmaker's flagship SUV. It will only be available with five seats, but it does come with a well-equipped cabin and 458 litres of boot space. It's one of the Kodiaq's more expensive competitors, with prices starting at £27,500.

The Kia Sorento has traditionally been the go-to budget SUVs and is available with seven seats, like the Kodiaq. However, at £28,794, it's significantly more expensive.

Kodiaq vRS

A sportier version of the car, the Kodiaq vRS, is on the cards, reports Evo.

Head of research and development Christian Strube told the magazine the new model will be powered by the turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder diesel engine from the Volkswagen Tiguan.

This would suggest a power output of around 237bhp and 369lb-ft torque, says Evo, which would send the SUV from zero to 62mph "in 6.5secs", making it the quickest Skoda in the range.

Strube also said plans for other vRS-badged cars were on hold as it was difficult to justify giving the treatment to other models due to tightening CO2 emissions and the hike in fuel prices.

Considering the already substantial popularity of the Kodiaq, a vRS version could be "a strong seller" thanks to its blend of performance and value, said Evo.

There are also plans for plug-in hybrids and electric models in the Skoda line-up, the mag continues, although this has not yet been confirmed for the Kodiaq.

Reviews

A “game-changing” car that lives up to the high expectations established by the suitably-named Skoda Superb, the Kodiaq is “exceptionally comfortable and roomy for seven and offers excellent value for money”, says Auto Express.

The Kodiaq is also an involving driving experience considering its size. "There’s still a pleasant degree of driver involvement," it says. "There's plenty of grip, the steering is well weighted and accurate, and the six-speed manual box is crisp."

Car Buyer says that "boot space is tight but usable with all seven seats raised and simply cavernous when the third row is folded."

The site also praised the Kodiaq's interior quality, adding that it "is so well made, in fact, that if there's ever been a car to move a manufacturer up a grade in terms of brand perception, this is Skoda's model".

Autocar recommends the mid-range model over the more powerful diesel engine, saying that it "moves the car along briskly enough for most of the people most of the time and is the more refined of the two units".

Although the Kodiaq’s price point puts it in direct competition with the likes of the Kia Sorento and Mitsubishi Outlander, the magazine says, it would "give the Kodiaq the nod over all of its rivals".

Skoda has announced a sleeker version of its critically acclaimed Kodiaq seven-seat SUV, bringing with it range-specific exterior styling tweaks and a more premium interior.

Road surface and engine noise is "well controlled" on petrol models, says the Daily Telegraph, while diesel units are "equal among [the Kodiaq's] VW Group peers" and can produce a "noticeable rattle when started".

The paper also says the car has "excellent seats" and a driving position that can be easily adjusted, offering drivers a great view of the road ahead and adding to the car's "credentials in the comfort department".

However, What Car? warns that while the low starting price "looks very tempting indeed", buyers will need to pay "thousands of pounds more" to get the more powerful 148bhp 2.0-litre diesel engine and seven seats.

Nevertheless, this model "still undercuts equivalent versions of rivals like the Kia Sorento" and resale values are expected to exceed its main competitors. The Kodiaq is also more economical than the Kia and emits less CO2.

It also advises anyone looking for a company car to consider smaller SUVs such as the Nissan Qashqai and Seat Ateca, saying these are considerably cheaper to run than the Kodiaq.

Another year, another major vote that will shape our future both politically and financially. At this rate, we’ll be writing about why it’s a great idea to invest in the company that makes those tiny pencils in the voting booths.

But this election, perhaps more so than any other recent general election, will have a real and powerful impact on the daily finances of every household in the country. It will directly affect you and the money in your pocket.

So we’ve taken a look at the pledges in the party manifestos and how they might impact your spending power and financial security. Here’s everything you need to go into that little cubicle with the facts, not the spin.

Conservatives

The Tories said they would scrap the triple-lock on the state pension from 2020, replacing it instead with a double-lock that sees the payment keep pace with earnings or inflation. However, if those remain stagnant the state pension will no longer rise each year regardless

They would raise the threshold for paying for social care from £23,000 to £100,000. However, under this policy, the person’s home would also be included in their calculation of assets for home care as well as residential care. Although it is (arguably) not included in the manifesto, Theresa May recently said they would consult on a cap on care costs

No more free school lunches for primary school children aged up to seven, although some children would benefit from free “breakfast clubs” instead

The Conservatives would means test for the winter fuel allowance, ending the £300 handout for richer pensioners

The personal tax allowance would rise to £12,500 by 2020, while the higher rate threshold would move up to £50,000

Crack down on “exaggerated” or fraudulent whiplash claims in order to reduce insurance costs

The Conservatives pledge to raise the National Living Wage to 60 per cent of earnings by 2020

They would make it easier to switch energy providers and have promised to introduce a fixed cap on energy tariffs, which would be regularly reviewed by Ofgem

A future Conservative government would “simplify” the tax system

Labour

People earning more than £80,000 a year would face an income tax hike to 45p, while there will be a new 50 per cent rate on earnings above £123,000

Labour pledge there would be no hike to VAT or National Insurance contributions during the next parliament

They promise to scrap student tuition fees

More free childcare would be rolled out, including 30 free hours to parents of three- and four-year-olds. There could also be some help for younger children’s childcare costs

Maternity pay would be extended to 12 months, while paid paternity leave would double to four weeks

Labour says it would guarantee the triple lock on the state pension

They would hike the minimum wage to the level of the living wage by 2020. It’s predicted that would be about £10 an hour at least

The party would take an axe to the Conservative’s current axe-wielding, by scrapping benefits sanctions, ditching the bedroom tax, reinstating housing benefit for 18- to 20-year-olds and reforming Universal Credit

Under a Labour government, renters would benefit from three-year tenancies and capped rent rises

Labour would scrap the married person’s tax allowance, where married couples only can save up to £230 a year if one of them has an income of £11,500 or under

They would reverse cuts to bereavement benefits

Parents paying school fees would have to pay VAT, with the money going to fund free school lunches for all primary school pupils

Liberal Democrats

The Lib Dems would add a 1p in the pound hike on income tax in order to funnel £6bn more into the NHS and social care

They would reinstate university maintenance grants for poorer students

Like Labour, they would roll out 15 hours of free childcare to two-year-olds

They would add an extra month’s paid paternity leave to fathers’ entitlements

A Liberal Democrat government would Introduce a higher council tax on second homes, potentially as high as 200 per cent

They would reverse cuts to universal credit and reintroduce housing benefit for 18 to 21 year olds

Carers would be able to earn £150 a week instead of £110 without losing their Carer’s Allowance

A Lib Dem government would maintain the state pension triple lock, meaning it would rise each year even if wages and inflation were stagnant

They would raise the inheritance tax threshold

The so-called bedroom tax would be reversed

Working age benefits would once again rise in line with inflation

They would introduce a “rent to buy” scheme, where rent payments would contribute towards eventually owning a share in the property

Abandon the two-child policy on benefits and scrap the infamous “rape clause”

SNP

The Scottish National Party is committed to preserving the current state pension triple lock, which would ensure pension values rise by the level of inflation, earnings, or 2.5 per cent – whichever is greater.

The party would halt plans to increase the state pension age past 66 years

Women affected by significant changes in state pension age over their working lives would be offered support

Increase income tax from 45p to 50p for earners of £150,000 or more and freeze VAT and National insurance contributions

Increase the minimum wage to the Living Wage

Preserve the Winter Fuel Allowance and extend it to those with severely disabled children

Scrap the bedroom tax

Abolish the two-child cap on tax credits

Plaid Cymru

A key premise of the manifesto is that the party will demand the money promised to Wales by the Leave campaign in a post-Brexit landscape and refuse to take a penny less

Open a publicly owned bank

Take steps to stop fuel costs from rising

Work to provide a Living Pension

Work to prevent the raising of the state pension age

Going a step further than Labour’s promise of a few extra bank holidays, the Greens are promising to phase in a four-day working week

They would scrap tuition fees entirely

A “wealth tax” would be introduced that targeted the top 1 per cent of UK earners

They promise a Green government would create a network of local people’s banks

A “Robin Hood” tax would be introduced, but only on transactions deemed high value

The Greens would transform inheritance tax so that it was determined by the wealth of the recipient and not the size of the estate

They would look at rolling out a universal basic income

The cap on National Insurance would be abolished, meaning the wealthiest would pay more

A Green government would raise the national minimum wage to the living wage level for all workers, regardless of their age

Both health and dental services would be transformed to ensure both were free at point of use

They would cut VAT on women’s sanitary products and provide them free of charge to the poorest

Housing benefit would be reintroduced for the under-21s, while rent controls would be created and enforced

Ukip

An extra £2bn every year to fund social care

An end to bedroom tax

Move towards abolishing inheritance tax but in the medium term raise the threshold to £500,000 or £1m for married and civil-partnered couples

A rise in the tax-free allowance to £13,500

Maintain the triple lock on pensions

A reduction in VAT on household bills

An end to tuition fees for certain degrees (science, medicine, technology, maths and engineering)

Freeze insurance premium tax

No National Insurance hikes for the self-employed

The Women’s Equality Party

Invest in universal childcare so that all parents can have access to free care once parental leave is over

Introduce a right to between five and 10 days of paid care leave from work

The former office building will be turned into 82 one- to five-bedroom apartments averaging £3.2m each

Work has begun to convert London’s landmark Centre Point building into luxury flats.

The former office building has been a focal point on the skyline for five decades, and at various times a symbol of the property industry’s failings and of protest against the capital’s lack of affordable housing. Now it will be turned into 82 one- to five- bedroom apartments boasting pool, spa and fitness facilities, as well as views over the west end.

Nearby, three-bedroom flats are being marketed at an average of £3.2m. A block of 13 affordable homes will be built next door as part of the project.

Centre Point, which stands at the cross-section of Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Street, attracted controversy when it was first built by property tycoon Harry Hyams in 1966. It stood empty as he tried unsuccessfully to find a single tenant willing to pay the money take it on, and squatters moved in briefly to demonstrate against its residential areas remaining empty when London was in the grip of a housing crisis. Eventually let, it changed hands several times before being bought by current owners Almacantar 2011.

The developers have taken on Rick Mather Architects and Conran and Partners to design the project, who, it said would “revive its sixties design appeal alongside cutting edge design and technology”. The project, which will include a new public square and 41,780 square feet of retail space, is next to Tottenham Court Road station which will eventually be served by the new Crossrail links.

Kathrin Hersel, development director, Almacantar, said the work would “turn Centre Point into a destination Londoners can be proud of”. She added: “The project will breathe new life into this landmark, giving it a sustainable and exciting future for the benefit of all Londoners and visitors to the capital.”

Work on Centre Point is expected to finish in the summer of 2017.

The development may be attractive to overseas buyers who are keen to invest in London property. Recent figures from the Department of Business showed in some parts of London a fifth of properties were owned by foreign buyers and in one development in Thameside it emerged 80% of homes had been snapped up by purchasers from overseas.

Serena Williams is tired of being asked if she considers herself the greatest athlete of our time.

The four-time Olympic gold medalist and five-time WTA champion answered the question decisively in a recent interview with Vanity Fair: “If I were a man, then it wouldn’t be any sort of question,” she said.

Ms Williams – who also holds the record for most Grand Slam titles in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles combined – has previously corrected reporters who asked if she is “one of the greatest female athletes of all time".

“I prefer the words ‘one of the greatest athletes of all time," she said at a post-Wimbledon press conference.

These days, the tennis champ is taking a break from the court, preparing for the birth of her first child.

She learned she was pregnant just one week before the Australian Open in January.

“If you would have told me last year in October or November that I would have a baby, not be pregnant but have a baby, I would have thought you were the biggest liar in the world,” she told Vanity Fair.

She added: “This is kind of how I am right now. This is happening sooner than later, and it’s going by so fast.”

But Ms Williams nine-month hiatus hasn’t shielded her from the incessant debate over where she would rank on a hypothetical list of “greatest athletes of our time”.

In a recent interview with NPR, former tennis great John McEnroe claimed Ms Williams would be ranked “like, 700 in the world” if she played in the men’s circuit. (He estimated that he would rank 1,200th.)

“That doesn't mean I don't think Serena is an incredible player,” he said. “I do … But if she had to just play the circuit — the men's circuit — that would be an entirely different story.”

Ms Williams, who has been ranked No 1 in the world by the WTA on eight separate occasions, fired back on Twitter.

“Dear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based,” she wrote.

In a follow-up tweet, she added: “I've never played anyone ranked ‘there’ nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I'm trying to have a baby. Good day sir.”

Mr McEnroe declined to apologise during recent appearance on CBS’ “This Morning,” and suggested Ms Williams settle the debate by playing against men.

Whether Ms Williams will take him up on the challenge has yet to be seen. As she told Vanity Fair: “I don’t think my story is over yet.”

University “safe space” policies are leaving academics afraid to speak their minds for fear of losing their jobs, a professor has claimed.

Dennis Hayes, professor of education at Derby University, suggested there is a “climate of censorious quietude” in universities that means important issues are simply not discussed.

His comments came as universities minister Jo Johnson warned that higher education institutions have a legal duty to ensure freedom of speech.

He said he had written to university bosses out of concern that this duty is being put at risk by policies of “safe spaces and no-platforming”.

The policies – typically put in place by student unions in a bid to protect students from discrimination and language they may find offensive – have led to fraught debate in recent months.

A number of high profile speakers, including feminist writer Germaine Greer and human rights activists Peter Tatchell and Maryam Namazie, have been asked not to appear at events held by some institutions for fear their opinions may be upsetting to some students.

Campaigners say the policies are increasingly impacting on the right to free speech – something they argue is vital within higher education.

During a debate on free speech on campus at a higher education conference held at Buckingham University, Mr Hayes, who is also director of Academics for Academic Freedom (AFAF) said: “There’s so many things that could be discussed, that you dare not say.

“So when you go to university now, you learn what not to say.”

Mr Hayes suggested there is a belief that someone cannot discuss certain topics, such as abortion, LGBT rights or racism, unless they have direct experience of them, adding that discussing this type of issue “can get you in serious trouble, if not the sack, but you get sent to Coventry”.

“No-one will talk to you.”

“What exists is a climate of censorious quietude in universities. Things are simply not discussed. Academics and students know what they should not discuss.”

Earlier, Mr Johnson told industry leaders at the conference: “Freedom of speech is a core legal duty for universities.

“For a very long time there’s been an obligation on institutions to ensure there is genuinely a climate in which ideas can be challenged and debates can be genuinely entered into.”

He said he had written to Universities UK “out of concern that this duty that universities have was at risk from safe spaces and no-platforming”.

He said he wanted to remind them that one of their purposes is to create an environment in which people can discuss and challenge ideas.

A report earlier this year by Spiked magazine and the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust suggested campus censorship has been increasing steadily over the past three years, with a growing number of institutions actively clamping down on ideas deemed not in keeping with campus values.

The Free Speech University Rankings (FSUR), drawn from examining the policies and bans of 115 universities and student unions, found almost two-thirds (63.5 per cent) were “severely” restrictive of free speech, with Russell Group institutions found to be significantly more censorious than average.

The NUS official “no-platform” list contains six groups including the British National Party and Al-Muhajiroun, a banned Islamic network in the UK.

Individual unions and student groups can, however, decide on their own policies and reject people on an individual basis. Current NUS guidelines ask student unions to “balance freedom of speech and freedom from harm”.

Goodwood’s annual Festival of Speed takes place this weekend and amongst the famous hill climb and manufacturer’s exhibitions is Bonham’s Collectors' Motor Cars auction.

Featuring vehicles owned, or previously owned, by famous car collectors, this year’s sale is also offering a range of vehicles that boast celebrity connections.

Decked out with black bodywork, black interior and blackened chrome, a Porsche 930 Turbo specially ordered by Peter Sellers is going on sale at with an estimate of £60,000 – £80,000.

Sellers was a well-known car enthusiast and at one time owned both an Aston Martin DB4GT and a Ferrari 500 Superfast.

Specially ordered equipment requested by Peter Sellers included “optional sports seats, rubber buffers on bumper horns, headlamp rings coloured, climate control, and a sunroof” but it’s the all-black finish that makes this car really distinctive.​

A Ferrari F40 previously owned by Pink Floyd guitairist David Gilmour is also up for sale with an estimate of £304,500.

Built to celebrate 40 years of Ferrari, the F40 is one of the best known models in the marque and is popular amongst collectors. Bought new by Gilmour in 1988, another F40 was purchased in the same year by fellow band member and Ferrari enthusiast, Nick Mason.

An engine fire resulted in a restoration by a later owner and Bonhams believes around £350,000 has been spent on the car over its lifetime.

Elton John’s Bentley Continental Convertible is expected to fetch between £90,000 and £120,000, representing a considerable increase on the £70,955 it was sold for in 2015.

Bought new in 1985, Bonhams notes: “It featured prominently in the video for Elton John's hit single of that same year, 'Nikita', where he is seen being driven in icy conditions and admiring a Russian soldier of that name. Subsequently the registration was changed to the personalised 'B20 ELT', which is extant today.”

Also on sale are ten rare Porsches, including a 1957 356A Carrera Speedster GS/GT that is expected to fetch one of the highest sales this year, with an estimate of £900,000 to £1,000,000.

You’re a big UFC fan. Coming from a pure boxing background, what made you gravitate toward MMA in terms of appreciating the sport and its warriors?

I’ve always enjoyed it from the K1 days. I’ve always watched it from when the likes of Mark Kerr, Mark Coleman and in the UFC when Tank Abbot, Ken Shamrock and Royce Gracie were fighting. So I’ve always been a fan really. It’s something that interests me.

A lot of people feel Conor McGregor does not have a chance against Floyd Mayweather. Do you feel he should be sparring with several world champion boxers to test the waters?

He already sparred with a couple of Irish top level amateurs. The fact of the matter is, he’s not a boxer. You can’t learn our sport overnight. The two sports are only similar in one way, and that is they’re both combat sports, and the ultimate goal is to leave your opponent unconscious. That is the only comparison between MMA and boxing.

Mayweather vs McGregor: From trash-talk to super-fight







18 show all Mayweather vs McGregor: From trash-talk to super-fight

































1/18 From trash-talk to super-fight Just how did an appearance on late-night show Conan and a rumbling Twitter feud turn into the biggest fight the sport of boxing has ever known.



Here, we tell the story of how the trash-talk turned into a super-fight. Getty Images

2/18 McGregor appears on Conan “If you’re asking would I like to fight Floyd Mayweather, I mean, who would not like to dance around the ring for $180m?” McGregor replied to a playful question from late-night host Conan O’Brien, in July 2015, on whether he would ever be tempted into switching sports.



“I would certainly box him if the opportunity arose,” he smiled.



“Most certainly.”

3/18 Mayweather's observation Mayweather then rekindled the speculation, that December. In an interview with FightHype on the worldwide adulation McGregor had received for knocking out Aldo in just 13 seconds, the American complained that he would never receive such acclaim from the public because of the colour of his skin.



“They say he talk a lot of trash and people praise him for it, but when I did it, they say I’m cocky and arrogant,” Mayweather observed.



“So biased! Like I said before, all I'm saying is this, I ain't racist at all, but I'm telling you racism still exists.” Getty Images

4/18 "I am an Irishman" This time, it didn’t take the other man the best part of half a year to respond. “Don’t ever bring my race into my success again,” McGregor commented in a long Instagram post, the very next day.



“I am an Irishman. My people have been oppressed our entire existence. And still very much are. I understand the feeling of prejudice. It is a feeling that is deep in my blood … If you want we can organise a fight no problem. I will give you a fair 80/20 split purse in my favour seen as your last fight bombed at every area of revenue.”



A feud was born.

5/18 McGregor 'retires' As interest in a fight with Mayweather began to increase, McGregor threatened to retire not just from MMA, but from sport altogether.



UFC president Dana White announced that the promotion has pulled McGregor from the main event at UFC 200, because of his refusal to participate in mandatory media duties. McGregor's response?



"I have decided to retire young. Thanks for the cheese. Catch ya's later."

6/18 Scoop Things came to a boil in May 2016. British tabloid The Sun reported that the two men were “on the verge” of agreeing to a deal, with an unnamed source telling the paper that “Floyd is obsessed with making Conor eat his words”.



The story attracted so much attention that Dana White, the president of the UFC, felt compelled to finally address the situation. He laughed off suggestions the super-fight would ever take place, instead pointing out that McGregor was contracted to the UFC, and would thus be in breach of contract should he attempt to organise a fight himself away from the confines of the Octagon. AFP/Getty Images

7/18 Battle of the photoshopped posters White's comments appeared to spur both men into action. First McGregor tweeted a mocked up fight poster with the caption 'MMA vs Boxing'... Getty Images

8/18 Battle of the photoshopped posters ... before Mayweather responded with an effort of his own (it wasn't quite as good).



Mayweather insisted began to insist a fight was “possible”. Then he told a journalist that he was a retired man and would only countenance returning to professional sport in order to fight McGregor. And then he pressed the nuclear button, offering the Irishman just $50m to fight him in what people were already describing as a billion-dollar bout. Getty Images

9/18 Leonard Ellerbe puts his foot down Hold the hype. Just as things were beginning to heat up, Mayweather’s promotions head, Leonard Ellerbe, poured cold water on the prospective fight, insisting it was “a calculated effort by McGregor to gain more fans”. Getty Images

10/18 Mac gets personal In an attempt to get discussions back on track, McGregor got personal.



"Call me CJ Watson!" he tweet, with a cartoon of him standing triumphantly above a knocked out Mayweather.



The caption was explosive: Mayweather was sent to prison in 2010 for the assault of his then-girlfriend. He was reportedly angry about text messages she had received from NBA star CJ Watson. Getty Images

11/18 White rebuffed At this point in the saga the president of the UFC, Dana White, reenters the fray.



Having previously insisted that the fight was a non-starter, he suddenly proposed a deal: $25m for each fighter, with the complicated PPV splits to be patiently worked out at a later date.



"He's a f***ing comedian," Mayweather replied. Getty Images

12/18 In February 2017... ... McGregor arrived in Las Vegas, to much excitement.



Mayweather tweeted the following. Getty Images

13/18 Conor's response McGregor's response to Mayweather's short statement was brutal and to the point.



"I am in Las Vegas. Floyd has retired on my arrival," he observed.

14/18 Conan's back! Without Conan O'Brien the biggest fight in the history of boxing would still be a daydream.



In March he invited Dana White onto his show, who said the following.



“I do think it’s gonna happen. I think it’s going to be a tough deal because obviously [there are] a lot of egos involved in this deal and a lot of people, so that always makes it tougher.



"On the flip side, there’s so much money involved. I just don’t see how it doesn’t happen.”

15/18 Conor and Conlan McGrgor was in New York to support Belfast boxer Michael Conlan in his professional debut against Tim Ibarra in March.



But the spotlight quickly sought him out. He reminded everyone that an announcement was imminent by shouting furiously into the face of ESPN boxing reporter Dan Rafael: "I AM BOXING!" Getty Images

16/18 Fine downgraded On March 22, an outstanding fine McGregor had with the Nevada Athletic Commission was downgraded, paving the way for the Irishman to obtain his necessary boxing license. Getty Images

17/18 McGregor confirms On Wednesday 14 June, the fight was finally confirmed by both men.



“THE FIGHT IS ON,” McGregor posted on Twitter, along with a mocking picture of himself side-by-side with Floyd Mayweather Snr.

18/18 Mayweather confirms “It’s official!" replied Mayweather on Instagram, along with a short promotional video confirming the involvement of Showtime. Getty Images

It’s basically like football and rugby; in both sports they play with a ball, but they’re totally two different sports. You cannot come into our sport and compete with the best. I mean, I’ve seen people saying if Conor McGregor catches Floyd Mayweather clean he could knock him out. So, basically are you trying to tell me Conor McGregor hits harder than a prime Miguel Cotto, Ricky Hatton, Manny Paquiao, Oscar De La Hoya, Shane Mosley? The list is endless.

Are you trying to tell me that Conor can hit harder than all those guys with ten ounce gloves on? Absolutely not! If this was in a cage this would be over in 30 seconds, but it’s in a boxing ring. You cannot learn what we do in a space of couple of months.

If McGregor does triumph, would this have an indelible impact on the sport of boxing?

It would be the biggest miracle in all of the sports. It will be the biggest shock in sports history ever. I’m talking about all and any sports ever created by mankind. That’s the kind of outside odds I have on Conor. I couldn’t even fathom how it would affect boxing. It would actually make a mockery out of boxing. If Floyd Mayweather loses, boxing is at stake here.

When the wrestler Antonio Inoki fought Muhammad Ali in the first ever major MMA bout, Inoki lay there in the ring kicking and bruising Ali’s legs. I guess it was staged. There’s no way I could compete with a wrestler, but if I hit the wrestler ‘boom!’ at any stage, even with a light punch, he’s going to sleep. But at the same time that wrestler is going to rip my arm socket out. Muhammad Ali’s MMA fight was a bit of a farce, but he got well paid, so good on him.

Mayweather v McGregor : Tale of the tape

McGregor has become the face of the UFC. He has carried the sport on his own and he’s done it. He’s in demand in the UFC. He’s a one off. You’d be lucky if you got someone else again that talks the way he does and to back it up like he does, so it can’t be all hype because he delivers too, but we will see on the day.

Amir Khan had challenged McGregor to a MMA bout last year. How would have Khan done had McGregor stepped in the boxing ring with the former world champ?

Like I said, you can’t learn boxing overnight. It’s ridiculous to even suggest it. The outcome would be exactly the same. Don’t get me wrong, Amir Khan is a lot more vulnerable than Mayweather, but when Amir will hit McGregor he wouldn’t even see the punches coming. I’ve trained with Amir Khan and I can tell you that he’s the fastest thing I’ve ever trained alongside. He’s that quick. Believe me when I say I’ve trained with some quick fighters in my time, he’s is by far the quickest I have ever seen up close and personal. I’ve travelled to places with him and trained with him when we were amateurs.

Would you ever consider a MMA bout if you took a year or so out of boxing?

Yes, I would consider fighting in MMA. I would train in submission wrestling and get ready for it. As long as the money makes sense, I will do it.

You’ve met and have been around Mayweather, how do you perceive him personally?

He’s exactly how he seems on TV. I don’t want to say ‘arrogant’ but it’s all about him, and everything he talks about comes down to money. So, as much as I admire him, there’s a saying ‘never meet your idols because they’ll always disappoint you’. And it was very true with this one.

The movie Creed was a hit. Have you recently considered making big money on the big screen in Hollywood instead of slugging it out in a brutal and bloody sport that you’ve dedicated your life to?

To be honest, it’s a possibility. I’ve been offered a couple of roles since then. I still stay in touch with Ryan Kruger, the director of Creed, and with Michael B Jordan from the movie who is a good friend of mine. So I won’t rule it out, I’ll tell you that much, but at the moment I’m a professional fighter and that’s my job, that’s what I do for a living, that’s how I earn for my children. I’m a fighter first and foremost. The acting is a possibility.

I enjoyed working with Stallone and it was a fantastic opportunity to be part of it. It was a fantastic experience working on Creed, one that will stay with me forever. I enjoyed everything about it, day to day grind. One thing I will say: it’s a lot more work than people believe. 12 hour days, every single day you work on set is 12 hours and some days can be 14 hours, some can be 16 hours. So it’s very demanding, you’ve always got to be on top of your game and turn up ready to work.

Your next big duel?

I leave it with Eddie Hearn. He’s made the right moves the right my career so far. He’s a good person, a friend of mine, someone I trust. I understand what I need to do in this business and trusting a promoter is very hard, but I do trust Eddie Hearn, so we’re doing well together and may it continue that way.

Would you make yourself available to help McGregor prepare for his historic bout if the opportunity is on the table, what’s your direct message to the Notorious?

My message to Conor McGregor is: ‘Well done. You’ve just earned yourself in the region of $100 million dollars. Good on you. May the best man win.’

Of course I would help him out. I really like Conor. I’m actually a Conor McGregor fan, so why not? I don’t think he’s going to need someone the size of me. I’m 6 ft 3 and I weigh 16 and half stones and I hit like a truck - completely opposite to Mayweather. So he’s not going to need me. However, if he needs me I’m happy to help him prepare for this fight and spar.

Jamie Murray will hook up with doubles queen Martina Hingis as he looks to win his second Wimbledon crown in this year's mixed doubles.

Murray won at the All England club with Jelena Jankovic back in 2007 but has now teamed up with the 36-year-old Swiss, who boasts 12 grand slam doubles titles, including three at Wimbledon.

Murray is number five in the men's doubles rankings while Hingis is third in the women's. The pair have been made top seeds at SW19 and receive a bye into the second round.

In teaming up with Murray, Hingis ends a hugely successful pairing with Indian Leander Paes which brought four grand slam titles, including the 2015 Wimbledon crown.

They last played together at the French Open but were first-round losers.

Murray is entering the mixed doubles for the first time since the 2016 French Open.

Last year's champions Heather Watson and Henri Kontinen are defending their crown and will play Nenad Zimonjic and Victoria Azarenka in the first round.

The Obama administration told the Supreme Court two years ago that without a requirement to buy insurance, the uninsured will wait to insure until they get sick. But guess what? Almost none of the uninsured are affected by the mandate any way.

That’s the conclusion of a new analysis by the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation, reported in the Wall Street Journal. According to the estimate, 90% of the uninsured in 2016 will be exempt from the mandate. Only 4 million people are expected to pay a fine for being uninsured that year.

The latest estimate is a substantial revision of the estimate the CBO made when the law was originally passed. In 2010, the agency estimated that about two-thirds of the uninsured would be exempt. Why the substantial increase in the latest report? It appears that the Obama administration has become increasingly liberal in its willingness to let people escape because of “hardships.”

Certain exemptions are written into the law itself. For example, the mandate doesn’t apply to American Indians, to people who have religious objections or to people who earn too little to be required to file an income tax return.

But the administration has piled on with 14 ways people can avoid the fine based on hardships. These include homelessness, domestic violence, being evicted from a residence, having a utility cut off, property damage from a fire or flood, and even a canceled insurance plan. Also, people can avoid the penalty if a close family member has died recently or if they have medical expenses resulting in substantial debt.

People can even claim an exemption if they experienced “hardship obtaining health insurance” (couldn’t negotiate HealthCare.gov). Although the government is asking for documentation to back up that claim, it doesn't require it.

So if the mandate affects very few of the uninsured, who does it affect? People who are insured.

Up to 80% of the people who had individual insurance last year will lose their coverage by the time all the ObamaCare rules completely set in. Up to 90% of the plans that cover people at work will lose their grandfathered status. In many of these cases, people are being forced to buy richer and more expensive plans – with more coverage than they want or need. In other cases, they may lose insurance altogether.

Early reports are that the trend of small business to dump their health plans and move employees onto the exchanges is occurring faster than was expected.

"Monkmania has Twitter buzzing," says The Guardian. Canadian economics student Eric Monkman has proven to be the breakout star of this year's series of University Challenge, thanks to his idiosyncratic facial expressions, intensely earnest demeanour and apparent lack of indoor voice.

Tonight, Monkman's Wolfson College, Cambridge, will take on Balliol College, Oxford, in the final of the venerable BBC quiz show. Already the internet is taking sides.

The student's appearances on the show have been accompanied by floods of tweets from admirers, who have coined the hashtag #Monkmania.

"People really seemed to have responded to my appearance in a way I didn't expect, which was a huge surprise for me," the postgraduate student told Cambridge News.

Of his trademark teeth-clenched expression, he said: "Even though I am maybe looking angry, I am just really trying to focus on the next question."

Tom Eames at Digital Spy attributes the popularity of the show's more eccentric contestants to the recent cultural enthusiasm for "geek-chic".

"In the last few years, everyone loves calling themselves a geek or a nerd, even though in the real world they might not be," he told the BBC. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-39482317]

Monkman is not the first University Challenge contestant to attract attention online. Here are a few of the show's other memorable characters:

The first University Challenge contestant to become a viral sensation was Gail Trimble, a postgraduate student at Corpus Christi who appeared on the show in 2009.

From botany to literature, nothing seemed to stump the well-rounded classicist. Trimble was responsible for 825 of her team's total 1,235 points, leading The Observer to wonder if she was the show's "cleverest contestant ever".

With Trimble at the helm, Corpus Christi easily rode to victory in the final – but their triumph was short-lived, as the team was disqualified when it emerged that one member had completed his studies before appearing on the show.

University Challenge's most impressive contestants may often appear aloof and intense, but the same cannot be said of Ted Loveday.

Viewers took the Cambridge Law student to their hearts not so much for his lightning-fast answers as for his unabashed excitement and eye-catching cable-knit jumper, borrowed from his dad.

Ever humble, he attributed his stunning performance to his habit of browsing Wikipedia before the show, Cambridge News reports.

The American science student captained Emmanuel College, Cambridge, to victory in 2011, becoming an unlikely heartthrob along the way, a turn of events that Guttenplan branded "odd".

Hearts were set aflutter when the student dared to do the unthinkable, curtly correcting Jeremy Paxman after he congratulated the team on a "good guess". "It wasn't a guess," Guttenplan shot back, instantly catapulting himself to the status of University Challenge legend.

Volvo plans to shift its entire car line-up to electric and hybrid powertrains by 2019, it has revealed.

The carmaker will release five fully-electric vehicles between 2019 and 2021, three of which will be launched under the company's Polestar performance brand. These will be joined by a host of hybrid-powered cars, which will be available with either petrol or diesel engines.

Chief executive Hakan Samuelsson said: "Volvo Cars has stated that it plans to have sold a total of one million electrified cars by 2025. When we said it, we meant it. This is how we are going to do it," he said.

The announcement means the Chinese-owned company is the "first major traditional automaker to set a date for phasing out vehicles powered solely by the internal combustion engine", says Reuters.

While Volvo "will continue to produce pure combustion-engine" cars before 2019, Reuters says, it could mark "the eventual end of nearly a century of Volvos powered solely that way".

Production of the electrified line-up will be based in the China, says AutoExpress, as it is the home country of Volvo's parent company Geely. However, the cars will continue to be built "for worldwide export".

But the firm is not just reducing the emissions of its vehicles. As Autocar reports, "it aims to have climate-neutral manufacturing operations by 2025".

Volvo also has a vision for 2020 in which "no person will be killed by a new Volvo" because of its enhanced autonomous safety systems, says the Daily Telegraph. The company has recently focused on driverless technology and aims to begin testing on public roads later this year.

LONDON British consumer goods maker Reckitt Benckiser trimmed its sales forecasts on Thursday, becoming one of the first companies to put a cost on a global cyber attack that disrupted its manufacturing and distribution.

Several major multinational companies, along with Russia's biggest oil firm and Ukrainian banks, were hit by a virus on June 27 that crippled computers, disrupting ports from Mumbai to Los Angeles and halting production at factories.

Reckitt Benckiser, which makes Dettol and Lysol disinfectants, Harpic cleaners and Durex condoms, said it estimated like-for-like revenue in the second quarter would fall 2 percent from a year earlier because of the attack.

The virus hit output at many of the company's more than 60 factories, as well as affecting orders, billing and shipping. Excluding that impact, and tax changes in India that hurt sales to a lesser extent, second-quarter sales would have been flat, the company said.

Reckitt's shares fell as much as 3.2 percent on Thursday to their lowest since May 19. The shares were 1.4 percent lower at 0858 GMT.

The cyber blindside came at a bad time for Reckitt Benckiser after its weakest performance in 15 years in the first quarter, when a collapse of its business in South Korea and a failed Scholl product innovation left sales unchanged..

Reckitt Benckiser has described 2017 as a "tale of two halves", saying the second half would improve as comparisons with the same period a year earlier get easier.

But it said on Thursday that like-for-like annual sales would now only increase 2 percent, instead of 3 percent.

Liberum analysts said Reckitt needs 5 percent sales growth in the second half to hit that target and that "may still prove ambitious in light of lingering effects from the cyber attack, Indian tax and competitive end markets".

PRODUCTION LOSSES

Following years of strong performances, Reckitt has a reputation for acquiring businesses and boosting sales by launching new products. But several sluggish quarters and its acquisition of baby formula maker Mead Johnson have raised questions about its strategy.

"We remain negative on the acquisition of Mead Johnson from a strategic, operational and financial point of view whereas organically we see signs of innovation fatigue meaning that there isn't anything obvious to offset the slowdown of the failed Scholl Express Pedi innovation," said analysts at RBC, affirming their "Underperform" rating.

Prior to the takeover deal, which closed last month, Mead Johnson's shares had fallen by a third over the past two years, as it has lost market share in China due to increased competition and changing consumer habits.

Reckitt Benckiser said the June cyber attack had disrupted its ability to manufacture and distribute products to customers in multiple markets, hitting its global supply chain.

"Consequently, we were unable to ship and invoice some orders to customers prior to the close of the quarter."

It said some of factories were still not operating normally, but that some of the revenue lost in the second quarter would be recovered in the current third quarter.

"However, the continued production difficulties in some factories mean that we also expect to lose some further revenue permanently," it said.

A company spokeswoman said she anticipated that all its factories would be running at some level by the end of the week.

"We expect an impact both on top line, through disruption to production, order handling and logistics, and margin, through the need to upgrade systems and recover data," Investec analysts said.

The U.S. Supreme Court has never declared a voting-district map unconstitutional for giving one party a political edge, but a pair of legal scholars hopes a metric they devised will change that.

The latest national accounts, for the first quarter of this year, show two alarming features. One is that real incomes have been falling for nine months, the longest such decline for 40 years. The other is that the savings ratio has fallen to 1.7 per cent of GDP, the lowest since the present set of records began in 1960.

Put the two together and you can see that people are maintaining their standard of living, but only by running down their savings. If you knock off the amount of money put into occupational pensions, which are of course a form of saving, household savings are actually negative.

Whenever you get a set of figures that are unusually gloomy, or unusually cheerful, you have to aim off a bit. The growth figure, only 0.2 per cent in the quarter, will probably be revised upwards, though it may take a couple of years before this happens. There are exceptional items, such as some one-off tax payments that depressed the savings rate. The impact of the fall in the pound on inflation will soon have moved through the system, bringing inflation back down and enabling incomes to grow again in real terms. As for growth this year, most forecasters expect it to be between 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent, not brilliant but not dreadful either.

But there is one number that even with these qualifications is really worrying and that is the savings ratio. Over the past 30 years the UK savings ratio has averaged around 8 per cent of GDP, that’s including the pension contributions. To go below 2 per cent is remarkable. Americans, never noted as great savers, still manage to save 5 per cent of GDP at the moment. Germans, who do have a stronger savings tradition, are saving nearly 10 per cent of GDP.

Which political party can fix our economy?

This matters for a host of reasons. For a start, if people don’t save enough for their retirement, then the burden shifts onto the state, or more precisely onto the present generation of working people who pay the bulk of the taxes. This creates social tension. You can see the resentment now among the young that they have to pay the pensions of the retired. But equally retired people who have paid tax all their lives feel that they have earned those pensions and deserve to get them now.

But this is not just an intergenerational thing. It is also an interpersonal thing. It depends a bit on how you calculate the numbers but roughly one third of the people in the UK have savings of less than one month’s income. That includes the old who have tended to save more. If you take people of working age it is worse, with about 40 per cent of them having less than £100 of savings – in effect virtually nothing. More than half the 30 million people who use credit cards cannot pay off the balance at the end of the month.

The tension between people with savings and those without will get worse. That is because until 10 years ago the proportion of people who owned their own homes was still rising. Now it is falling. Buying a home is a form of forced saving. Unless you have an interest-only mortgage part of the monthly mortgage bill is paying off the principal of the loan. Anyone who rents, now a majority of young people, is not forced to save in this way.

So what’s to be done?

For a start it would be helpful to have a return to normal interest rates. If you had to devise a policy that would deter people from saving and encouraging them to borrow, you would say: “Right, we are going to keep the interest on savings below the rate of inflation and we are going to keep borrowing rates for homes down to 3 per cent or so.”

That is the lure the authorities have given them, and surprise, surprise, people have taken the bait.

Next, and this is happening, we have to get everyone into a personal pension. That is what the new system of auto-enrolment is about. Unfortunately the UK occupational pension system, 20 years ago the envy of the world, has been undermined by three things. One was the raid on pension dividends by Gordon Brown back in the 1990s. A second has been the chopping and changing of the rules under which people can set aside part of their income for a pension. And the third are the supposed “prudential” rules that require, or at least encourage, pension funds to put money into low-yielding government securities rather than higher-yielding equities.

The key change needed is to get people to accept that it is too risky to expect that a government in 30, 40 or more years’ time will be able to pay decent pensions. Once you accept that politics are inherently unpredictable you recognise that you have to take action yourself.

That leads to a final point. What has happened to the culture of saving? Has it simply become too easy to spend? Credit cards surely increased the incentive to spend. Have contactless debit cards now made spending easier still? Why do Germans save and Britons not? I don’t know the answers to any of these questions but I am troubled by the idea that a country that does not save is a country that is taking risks with its future.

Summer has officially arrived in the UK and it looks like the perfect weather for a spin in a drop-top supercar.

Luckily there are a host of new cars that have just reached the market. These offer buyers supercar levels of performance with the added allure of no roof.

These are some of the fastest and most luxurious cars in the supercar market, all of which come with powerful engines and lashings of leather and carbon fibre.

Here they are – the five best drop-top supercars for summer driving;

Audi R8 Spyder V10 Plus

Audi has only just launched the faster Plus variant of its R8 Spyder V10, making it the newest car on this list.

It's powered by a 5.2-litre naturally aspirated V10 engine that has been upgraded from the base model's 533bhp to 602bhp in the Plus. Power is sent to all-four wheels, although drivers can send up to 100 per cent of it to the rear axle using a switch in the cabin.

The drop-top supercar has a sportier look than the base car. Evo says the R8 Spyder V10 Plus has a "liberal use of carbon fibre" that includes a subtle wing at the rear. The Plus also comes with the range-topping coupe's multi-spoke wheels.

Orders are due to open later this month, with prices starting at £147,470.

Ferrari 488 Spider

Ferrari's drop-top supercar offering comes in the form of its new 488 Spider, the Italian firm's first turbocharged car since the iconic F40.

The company's entry-level mid-engined supercar has a 3.9-litre twin-turbo V8 motor that sends power to its rear wheels. Zero to 62mph comes around in 3.0secs, making it one of the fastest drop-top supercars available.

One of the car's standout features is its handling and ride quality, says Top Gear. The 488 Spider is fitted with magnetic dampers, which helps it "keep everything tied down while filtering out rough surfaces".

It's among the most expensive cars on this list at £203,000, although that figure could rise substantially after optional extras are added.

Lamborghini Huracan LP610-4 Spyder

Those who want Audi R8 V10 levels of performance but with a more striking design may want to consider the Lamborghini Huracan LP610-4 Spyder.

The R8 and Huracan are both products of the Volkswagen group, so they have components such as drivetrains and aluminium underpinnings.

Behind the driver sits the same 602bhp 5.2-litre naturally aspirated V10 engine as the R8. It boasts a zero to 62mph time of 3.6secs. Lamborghini has also fitted a fast roof – the Spyder's fabric top can be lowered in just 17secs.

The Huracan LP610-4 Spyder is available to order now at £205,000.

McLaren 570S Spider

McLaren's 570S coupe launched last year to critical acclaim. The British carmaker has now revealed a drop-top version in time for summer.

What makes the 570S Spider stand out is that it has "no performance compromises" over the coupe version. This is because the Spider is built on a carbon fibre structure, which is strong enough to maintain the car's rigidity without a roof.

A 3.8-litre twin-turbo V8 engine sits in the middle of the car. It boasts a power output of 562bhp and 443lb-ft of torque, according to AutoExpress. This helps launch the Spider from zero to 62mph in 3.2secs and on to a top speed of 204mph "with the roof in place".

McLaren is already accepting orders for the 570S Spider. Its asking prices starts at £164,750.

Porsche 911 Turbo S Cabriolet

Porsche's 911 Turbo S Cabriolet may not be a conventional mid-engined supercar like the other cars on this list, but it's among the fastest supercars on the market.

The Turbo S Cabriolet features a twin-turbo flat-six engine that sits over the rear axle in the same position as the majority of 911 road cars. The motor's 572bhp and 553lb-ft of torque is sent to all-four wheels, says Evo, allowing it to go from zero to 62mph in 2.9secs.

While the power levels and accretion times may seem "scary" to some, the magazine says the car's handling will be "predictable and controllable" for most drivers.

The Turbo S Cabriolet is also the cheapest car on the list at £145,773, but there will be plenty of optional extras to choose from.

Bhushan Steel Ltd reported a March-quarter loss that was much bigger than stated earlier in its unaudited results, as the debt-laden steelmaker was hurt by higher costs.

Audited net loss for the quarter was 11.31 billion rupees ($174.7 million), compared with the unaudited 7.57 billion rupees loss reported in May, Bhushan Steel said late on Wednesday. bit.ly/2uMA0Mr

However, the fourth-quarter loss narrowed marginally from the 11.85 billion rupees loss it reported a year earlier.

Total expenses rose more than 18 percent to 59.94 billion rupees for the quarter. This was about 51 percent higher than the unaudited figure reported earlier.

The steelmaker said last month that a consortium of lenders had authorised State Bank of India to refer the company to the National Company Law Tribunal for insolvency proceedings.

In a bid to resolve the country's $150 billion stressed loan problem, the Reserve Bank of India in June had urged lenders to start bankruptcy proceedings against 12 large loan defaulters, including Bhushan Steel, sources had told Reuters.

This ambulance found itself in a tight spot on the way to an incident in Dorset SaveDinahsHollow/BNPS

An ambulance had to abandon an emergency call after becoming trapped against a lorry in a narrow village street. It became firmly wedged while trying to pass a lorry that had been diverted through Melbury Abbas, near Shaftesbury in Dorset. Unable to move, the crew had to radio for another ambulance to be sent to the emergency instead (writes Simon de Bruxelles).

Residents blamed the incident on a a controversial traffic management scheme instigated by Dorset county council. The scheme — to divert southbound HGVs off the main road, the A350, in order to reduce traffic flows — means that lorries are now required to take a detour through the village from which they were previously banned. Residents say that the diversion has resulted in dozens of…

WASHINGTON—Federal Reserve officials in June readied plans to start slowly shrinking the central bank’s large portfolio of bonds and other assets in the next few months, and the debate since then over when to launch the plan has increasingly pointed to September.

Several officials said the Fed had sufficiently prepared markets to initiate the run-off “within a couple of months,” according to the minutes of the central bank’s June meeting released on Wednesday. Some others said waiting longer could them give more time to...

Saudi Arabia and three other Gulf states have issued Qatar with a 13-point list of demands, including the cutting of diplomatic ties with Iran and the closure of its Al Jazeera television channels.

See related Turkey to send troops to Qatar as diplomatic row continues

Other demands include a halt to military cooperation with Turkey and that Doha stops funding extremists designated as terrorist groups

Qatar has been given ten days to comply, although the message does not say what will happen if it fails to do so.

The list from Saudi Arabia, together with Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, which have been blockading Qatar since early June, was obtained by the Associated Press and a translation was published in the Dubai-based Khaleej Times newspaper today.

It is likely to ratchet up tensions in the Gulf and lead to Qatari objections that its neighbours are trying to dictate its sovereign affairs, said the New Arab current affairs website.

Qatari foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told France 24 Doha would not accept any "foreign dictations".

He added that "Qatar had always abided by international laws and played a key role in the international coalition fighting [Isis]", reports Al Jazeera.

Doha has already refused to close Al Jazeera, while the country's ambassador to the US ambassador told the Financial Times this week that opponents "want to undermine our sovereignty".

McLaren's all-new 720S supercar will boast a zero to 62mph time to rival the company's P1 hypercar.

The latest addition to the firm's popular "Super Series", which made its public debut at the Geneva Motor Show, replaces the three-year-old 650S and joins the line-up between the entry-level 540C and the million-pound P1.

It has been built around McLaren's second-generation carbon fibre chassis, which encases the whole of the cockpit in a single mould for better structural rigidity. The first generation cockpit, used by the MP4-12C and 650S, only covered the lower half of the cockpit.

McLaren's new supercar will reach the UK in May, with prices starting from a little more than £208,000.

Here's everything we know so far.

Design

McLaren has completely redesigned its Super Series car and introduced a new eye socket-style front-end, which AutoExpress says channels airflow around the headlights for improved cooling. The cluster is divided into two air ducts that are separated by a thin daylight LED strip.

The new design also axes the side intakes from the 650S, replacing them with two ducts on either side of the cockpit. Two small inlets are also positioned lower down and further back from the doors, reducing the turbulence around the wheel arches and generating downforce.

At the rear is a body-width wing and airbrake, which is automatically activated to either increase downforce or reduce drag. McLaren claims the added downforce is "more than double" that of the 650S.

Chassis and suspension

McLaren is renowned for high-tech, hydraulically-connected dampers, which controlled by "an on-board management system allows independent movement when a more comfortable ride is required", says Evo.

The system appears on the 720S, although it gets McLaren's latest chassis control. The upgrade comes with "12 additional sensors, including an accelerometer at each corner to measure the wheel speed” - as well as "two pressure sensors per damper", adds the magazine.

This equates to around a six per cent increase in mechanical grip over the car's predecessor and can be tweaked through the car's Comfort, Sport or Track driving modes, says AutoExpress.

Along with the chassis upgrades, McLaren has improved the brakes over the outgoing 650S, helping the 720S go from 62mph to a complete standstill in 2.8secs, says Top Gear, while braking from 186mph to zero comes around in just 6.9secs.

While manufacturers such as Ferrari and Porsche have moved over to electric steering, continues the site McLaren has used a hydraulic system designed to provide a similar feeling to the track-focused 675LT, which has"the best steering of any road car".

Performance

The 720S gets a 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 engine, which is a departure from the old 3.8-litre V8 that has powered every McLaren road car since 2011. With a power output of 710bhp and 568lb-ft of torque, the new motor has 54bhp and 62lb-ft more than the 650S.

Power is channelled to the rear wheels through a seven-speed automatic gearbox, launching the 720S from zero to 62mph in a P1-rivalling 2.8secs and on to a top speed of 212mph. New brakes and tyres also allow the car to stop from 124mph in a claimed 4.6secs.

In addition, a host of driving modes allows owners to play with the power. For example, McLaren's "variable drift control" reduces the car's traction and stability control to allow for a degree of wheel spin.

Reviews

As a replacement for McLaren's outgoing 650S supercar, the 720S is "nothing short of exemplary" and "another amazing leap for a brand that seems to have come a very long way in a relatively short space of time", AutoExpress says.

Its substantial overhaul has seen a complete redesign of the exterior, with the old car's large intakes scrapped in favour of more compact side vents while dihedral doors, inspired by the company's F1 hypercar, have been added.

The completely changed front end features two large holes around the headlights. It's a design that may split opinion, says Car, but it does offer aerodynamic benefits at higher speeds.

Despite the extensive tweaks McLaren has made, the magazine claims the 720S is still incorporates the company's "everyday supercar" philosophy.

"The hydraulic suspension ensures an excellent ride" and there's also "stacks of luggage space", it adds. Owners get 150 litres of space in the front and 210 litres in the rear, which combined is more than what's on offer in a Ford Focus hatchback.

The 720S is "utterly absurd" and "wonderfully ridiculous", says Autocar, and McLaren has managed to give the car a massive amount of power without it feeling "uncontrollable" or overpowered.

This is largely helped by the coupe's ability to absorb bumps and rough surfaces with ease, all while "retaining maintaining mammoth control of its body". There's "little lean when turning" and the nose rarely dives under braking.

CarBuyer agrees it's among the "most responsive" and "poised" cars around, but says it "transforms into a quiet, smooth long-distance cruiser when you ease off".

Drivers get "a panoramic view of the road thanks to elegantly slim windscreen pillars" while the "advanced interior" is dominated by a "motorsport-influenced instrument pod that transforms from to a busier, more informative display when you’re on the open road".

While Evo says the 720S is "sensationally quick", it adds the car is let down by a "lack of an exciting engine note". The 4.0-litre bi-turbo V8 motor produces "a lot of hissing and wooshing", but isn't as "thrilling" as a supercar should be.

Nevertheless, concludes the site, the 720S is a "faster" and "more capable" car than its 650S predecessor, with ride comfort and handling that are on "another level".

Price and release

Orders have already opened, with prices starting from £208,600. That's around £8,000 more than the 720S's predecessor and nearly £75,000 more than the entry-level 540C.

McLaren reveals its P1-rivalling 720S supercar

7 March

Latest addition to the Super Series gets a bigger engine to do 0-62mph in 2.8secs

McLaren's all-new 720S supercar, unveiled today at the Geneva Motor Show, boasts a 0-62mph time to rival the company's million-pound P1 hypercar.

Replacing the popular 650S in the company's Super Series, the 720S features a larger twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 710bhp and 568lb-ft of torque - 54bhp and 62lb-ft more than the outgoing model.

Power is channelled through a seven-speed automatic gearbox that takes the 720S from standing to 62mph in 2.8secs, the same figure as McLaren's flagship P1.

The 720S has been designed around McLaren's new "Monocage II carbon fibre tub" that houses the whole of the passenger cell, including the roof, Evo reports. This has enabled the company to lower the door sills for easier access, while the windscreen is "deeper and broader" to allow a better field of view.

It should also be a frugal car, too, with CarBuyer reporting it will be as fuel efficient as a Volkswagen Golf hatchback, "largely thanks to the carbon fibre chassis", which boasts a significantly lower weight compared to regular road cars.

There's also an updated version of the fully independent suspension system that debuted on the MP4-12C in 2011, says Autocar. The new layout has an additional 12 sensors that can sense and adapt to different terrain, resulting in "better contact between the tyres and the road surface".

Prices start at £208,600, £8,000 more than the 650S and around £75,000 more than the entry-level 540C. Orders are open now, with deliveries expected to reach buyers in May.

Wonder Woman doesn't open in cinemas for another two weeks, but DC Comic's latest superhero film adaptation is already getting some joyful reactions on social media.

Monster director Patty Jenkins's take on the story moves the action to the early 20th century, with Gal Gadot starring as Amazonian princess Diana.

She discovers a US military pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) washed ashore on her home island Themyscira and, moved by his description of the devastating events of World War I, feels compelled to leave her island paradise for London to help end the terrible conflict.

Warner Bros screened the film to select press last week and while full reviews are still embargoed, the spoiler-free reactions trickling out on social media have been very positive.

Some call Wonder Woman their favourite DC film yet, while others compare it to Christopher Reeves's Superman and Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight.

WONDER WOMAN is great. My favorite of the recent DC movies. It's fierce, funny, well-written and badass. @GalGadot owns it. Her lasso FTW pic.twitter.com/rQ0ufZxWXP — ErikDavis (@ErikDavis) May 19, 2017

Others have praised the films humour, action and the charming lead actors Gadot and Pine.

Very pleased to report that #WonderWoman is the best DC movie since THE DARK KNIGHT. I'm already looking forward to seeing it again. — Silas Lesnick (@silaslesnick) May 19, 2017

The most wonderful thing about WONDER WOMAN is the wonderful Wonder Woman. Gal IS Wonder Woman. Now then, about WONDER WOMAN — Josh L. Dickey (@JLDlite) May 19, 2017

WONDER WOMAN: Easily my favorite DCEU film. Has the humor and heart the franchise so desperately needs. Gadot and Pine are charming as hell. — Kate Erbland (@katerbland) May 19, 2017

The posts will come as a relief to many fans, especially after speculation the film would bomb.

Last year on Mashable, Josh Dickey warned that Wonder Woman "probably isn't coming to save us", saying there was a very good chance that the film would be "terrible", like those other "soul-drowning bogs of suckitude" Man of Steel, Batman V Superman and Suicide Squad, which looked great but turned out to be "the most disappointing movie of summer".

"Marketing sleight of hand" can turn expensive action shots and one-liners into great trailers, he says, but that's "not enough to make great movies".

However, the more optimistic Robert Yaniz Jnr on CheatSheet this month suggested Wonder Woman would be the best DC film ever and that the casting of Gadot was "one of the film's few bright spots that nearly everyone agreed on".

LONDON Britain's energy market regulator Ofgem has launched an investigation into British Gas' switching terms, it said on Thursday.

The inquiry will examine whether Centrica-owned (CNA.L) British Gas breached licence conditions relating to its obligations to domestic customers who switch to another supplier.

The inquiry comes after consumer affairs website Moneysaving Expert raised concerns about the issue, Ofgem said in a statement.

Ofgem licence conditions state that suppliers should not charge termination fees for any switch that takes place within the 49-day "switching period" before the expiry of a fixed-term contract, the regulator said.

Rafael Nadal may have entered Wimbledon in a rich vein of form but he has since been brought down to earth by a simple self-service checkout machine.

The world number two, safely in the second round after Monday’s straight sets win over John Millman, was seen struggling to pay for six cans of Diet Coke in a local Tesco on Tuesday night.

Nick Roberts, a fellow customer, stepped in to assist Nadal and then shared his story on Twitter.

“Just done Rafa Nadal’s shopping for him on the self service tills on the tesco express in Wimbledon village. Surreal,” Roberts tweeted.

He added: “It was very exciting. He bought a 6 pack of Diet Coke. Didn’t need a bag. Environmentally conscious and awesome at tennis.

“Oh, and he was lovely with everyone in there. I hope he doesn’t mind that I’ve tweeted about this. I was just really excited!”

Nadal was also spotted out and about around Wimbledon last week, before the tournament started on Monday.

Tony Blair was not "straight with the nation" about his reasons for going to war in Iraq, Sir John Chilcot says. In his first interview since publishing his report on the conflict last year, the inquiry chief said the evidence given was "emotionally truthful", but relied on beliefs rather than facts. Blair's spokesman said "all these issues" had been dealt with.

The Audi Q2 is the latest addition to the German manufacturer's range. It's a small crossover, serving as the entry-level SUV in the company's ever-expanding Q line-up.

Unveiled at this year's Geneva Motor Show, the Q2 is on sale now and first deliveries are set to take place in a matter of weeks. There's a generous selection of petrol and diesel powertrains on offer from launch, as well as the option of Quattro all-wheel drive. More choices are on the way, including powerful S and RS versions.

The Q2 may be the smallest and cheapest Audi SUV you can buy, but it's certainly not the least interesting. It stands out against its larger Q3, Q5 and Q7 siblings thanks to some unique design traits. Audi is pitching it to younger buyers and there are plenty of customisation options, such as vibrant paint colours and trim inserts to make the cheapest Audi crossover more appealing.

It's still a premium-edged car, though, and a posher alternative to the likes of the Nissan Juke.

Here's all you need to know about the Q2 - and what the reviewers make of Audi's small, funky crossover.

Design

Aimed squarely at a younger audience, the Q2 stands out in Audi's range, with bolder, sharper lines and a different shape to the company's other SUVs.

The small frame has been made to look as hunched and sporty as possible, with a high shoulder line in tandem with a roof that slopes down towards the rear, pinching the back end. Placed onto this are several new lines and design cues, such as the cut-out running down the top of the doors, the squarer, wider-looking profile around the back and a slightly different face.

Rugged-looking cladding and skid plates also make the cut and they can be colour coded with the car's body.

There are also those huge, thick C-pillars towards the rear. Audi calls them "blades" and, like many aspects of the Q2, they can be customised. Other options include 12 exterior colours, a choice of alloy wheels, ranging from 16ins to 19ins (40cms to 48cms), and a two-tone contrasting roof.

Overall, the car is 59.4ins (1.5m) tall and 70.5ins (1.8m) wide, with a length of 165ins (4.2m), so it's length is roughly 4.7ins (12cms) shorter in terms of length than the A3 and 3.9ins (10cms) smaller in height than the Q3.

Interior and Tech

Interior and Tech

Inside, the Q2 is similar to the Audi A3 it's based on and incorporates the horizontal design trait that can be seen in the majority of the firm's latest models. There's a host of colourful trim and metal options to choose from, many of which aren't available on the A3 hatchback.

The cabin is "clean" and "uncluttered", says CarBuyer, while the soft-to-the-touch plastics and brushed aluminium trim elements are "of high quality".

Standard equipment includes a seven-inch infotainment screen above the dashboard, operated through a rotary dial and buttons located near the gearstick. The switches are "easy to read" and make surfing the system "a doddle", says What Car?.

The screen can be used to alter the car's settings, as well as access the radio, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto through Bluetooth or USB. The standard system itself is "intuitive", adds the website, while Sports models and upwards get a sat-nav bundled in.

A Bang & Olufsen sound system comes as an optional extra, as does Audi's Virtual Cockpit, which replaces the dashboard's physical dials with a 12.3ins screen, controlled via buttons on the steering wheel.

Space and practicality

Space is good for passengers in the rear, says What Car?, although the BMW X1 and Seat Ateca "provide families with much more".

The Q2 is 4.7ins shorter than the A3 hatchback on which it's based, something the magazine claims causes taller passengers in the back to brush their heads against the roof lining. They'll also find "their knees close to the front seatbacks".

At 405-litres, the Q2's boot is around 50 litres larger than the A3 hatchback and its rival Nissan Juke, while folding the rear seats flat opens up a total luggage space of 1,050-litres.

Accessing the Q2 is simple thanks to its wide opening doors and tall roofline compared to the A3, says CarBuyer. It's also more comfortable than the Nissan Juke and Renault Captur, while an adjustable steering wheel and front seats that can easily accommodate tall adults mean the driving position is "excellent".

There's an abundance of storage bins and cubby holes spread around the cabin. The glove compartment is well sized, as are the door bins, with a small slot located in the centre console for the ignition key.

Engines

Kicking-off the range of petrol engines is a 1.0-litre turbocharged three-cylinder unit, which CarBuyer says packs a "surprising punch" and doesn't need to be worked hard to "match its official zero to 62mph time of 10.1secs".

That's followed by a 1.4-litre TFSI motor with 148bhp with a zero to 62mph of 8.5secs, adds the website. It's paired to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox, although a six-speed manual can be specced for "hands-on involvement".

Topping the range of petrol engines is a 187bhp 2.0-litre turbo motor that comes with an all-wheel drive system.

"The best all-round engine in the range is the 1.6 TDI diesel," What Car? tells readers. This engine sits at the bottom of the diesel line-up and is mated to a manual gearbox, with an automatic version available as an optional extra.

There's also a 148bhp 2.0-litre diesel option, which the website says "delivers quite effortless pace, whether you are driving in town or on the motorway". However, it adds that this engine is only available on mid-spec cars and up, so it could be a pricey option for some.

Quattro all-wheel-drive

Front wheel drive versions of the Q2 are likely to dominate sales and be the most popular choices, though all-wheel-drive will be available of you need it. Right now, an all-wheel-drive system can be found on the 2.0-litre TDI, though next year's 2.0-litre TFSI petrol will get the drivetrain too.

CO2 and efficiency

Audi has yet to release full CO2 and MPG ratings for the upcoming Q2, but the engines it uses can be found in a number of the firm's other cars. These offer a glimpse of what buyers can expect efficiency wise when full details are revealed later this year and the order book for the small crossover opens.

CarBuyer gives a helpful account of what buyers can expect. The tiny 1.0-litre TFSI three cylinder returns 62.3mpg when fitted to Audi's A3 hatchback, with CO2 figures of 104g/km. Expect it to be slightly less efficient in the Q2 owing to the car's shape, with MPG figures dipping under 60mpg on a combined run. This could push the CO2 emissions over the 110g/km threshold at an annual Vehicle Excise Duty of £30.

As for the 1.4-litre TFSI petrol, it makes use of cylinder deactivation technology – shutting down two of the engine's cylinders when the engine is under-stressed and they aren't needed as a way of saving fuel. This engine comes in Audi's smallest hatchback, the A1, and it delivers 58.9mpg. It's also available in the larger Q3 crossover – the car destined to sit right above the Q2 in the range – returning 51.4mpg. As such, expect MPG to be in the mid 50's.

The tax bill could be £110 a year though – the added size and weight of the Q3 means that it produces 127g/km compared to the same engine in the A1. In the Q2, it could easily be over the 120g/km threshold.

Diesel engines will be the most popular choices on the Q2, and CarBuyer says that both the 1.6 and 2.0-litre TDIs should produce between 65-75mpg officially, with lower CO2 figures, for tiny tax bills.

Trim levels

The entry level Q2s will come in SE trim, with 16ins alloy wheels as standard, as well as grey blade C-pillars, a seven-inch infotainment screen and Audi's pre-sense city braking and collision avoidance system. Those bumping their orders up to Q2 Sport trim will get 17ins wheels as standard, as well as sports seats and ice-silver detailing on their blade panel.

At launch, Q2 S-Line will make for the range-topping cars. These will get 18ins wheels, with 19ins alloys available to spec. The blade C-pillar changes colour, this time to a titanium shade, and LED headlights come as a part of the package. Buyers can spec or remove the firmer sports suspension setup and partial leather interior. Audi's progressive steering will come as standard on all versions.

Prices and release

The order books are open and customers will get hold of their Q2s this November.

Prices start from £20,230 for the 1.0-litre TFSI in SE trim level. However, you'll have to wait a little longer for the entry-level car to go on sale, alongside the 2.0-litre TDI, which will be priced from £26,930 in Sport trim.

The first two engines on offer make up the car's mid-range. The 1.4-litre TFSI with 148bhp will go on sale from £22,380 in SE trim, with the less powerful 1.6-litre TDI priced at £100 more. These are the only two cars where you'll be offered a choice when it comes to gearboxes. Equipping the seven-speed S-Tronic box is a £1,550 premium. Entry level 1.0-litre cars are six-speed manual only, while the 2.0-litre TDI comes with the S-Tronic box as standard.

Opting for Sport trim over the standard SE spec level on the 1.0-litre, 1.4-litre and 1.6-litre is also a £1,550 premium and top trim S-Line cars with an exclusive body kit, 18ins alloys, LED lighting and partial leather interior command £2,250 over the price you'll pay for an equivalent Sport car.

The range tops out at £30,610 for the 2.0-litre TDI in S-Line trim, with Quattro all-wheel drive specced, although there will be a more expensive, limited edition model on sale in September.

Called the Q2 Edition #1, it will come with exclusive trims, paints, alloys, and contrasting stitching on the seats and start at £31,170.

Reviews

Auto Express says that Audi's new crossover has been worth the wait. The price tag may be high compared to rivals in the small crossover class, but if you're willing to part with a little more cash, you get genuine big car spoils and quality, wrapped up in a stylish design.

The car's interior is one of its trump cards. It's similar to the quality cabins you'll find on other small Audis, but the Q2's colourful dashboard inserts and youthful extras "lift what would otherwise be a pretty conservative design".

What Car? Certainly thinks Audi's new baby is up to scratch and gives the Q2 four stars out of five.

The magazine says the car company has built a "desirable and fine-driving small SUV with a stunning interior" and that it is sure to entice buyers looking for quality above all else.

While the funky, youthful exterior may not appeal to all, the Q2's cabin is brilliant, it adds. You'd expect no less in an Audi, as its interiors have gained a reputation for faultless build quality and premium, well-crafted materials. There's not much on the market that can rival it, says the magazine.

The Virtual Cockpit display is also recommended as being worth the extra cash.

The magazine recommends the 1.6 TDI and says the driving experience is also fun, as the car takes corners with plenty of grip and traction. What Car? also found that with the progressive steering system, the Q2 is an easy car to manoeuvre at slow speeds.

The ride quality – and expensive price tag – are the only things stopping the new Audi from getting a five out of five rating, it says, adding that the Q2's standard suspension setup is a little firm and it's easily the most expensive car in its class.

Top Gear's verdict is pretty straightforward - because the Q2 is a pretty straightforward car. It "feels like a subtle repackaging of the A3 Sportback – a new 'top hat' if you like, perched on the versatile MQB box of bits", it says.

It's "not revolutionary in any particular area", but it needn't be, continues the mag, which concludes the Q2 is an accomplished small crossover and "precisely what customers are clambering for" while being different enough to stand out in what's becoming a crowded market.

The Q2's cabin - a "pleasant place to be" - shares the "uncluttered" design of others in the range, says Evo, although it notes that while the interior is "largely tasteful and appealing", there are a few "gimmicky" brightly coloured lights and "contrasting panels".

The strong first impression continues on the road, with the magazine saying the suspension "absorbs" defects in the road in all of its driving modes. The ride can be a bit "fidgety" in the sports mode, it adds, but it is far from "unacceptably harsh".

Buyers can expect a safe and comfortable car to drive, says CarBuyer, although the crossover is "not hugely involving". There's "commendably little body lean" through corners and the optional seven-speed automatic is easy to recommend over the six-speed manual.

The 405-litre boot "comfortably outstrips" the Nissan Juke, says the site, and there's plenty of space for six-feet tall adults in "relative comfort". Passengers in the rear, however, may find their "knees brushing" up against the back of the front seats and the middle seat is a little cramped.
