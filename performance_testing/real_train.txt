As the pound languishes against the euro, British travellers are now benefiting from one welcome development: the abolition of roaming charges for using their phones across Europe.

The EU started putting the squeeze on intra-European roaming charges a decade ago, with a series of increasingly stringent price caps. From 15 June 2017, the final step in the European Commission’s clampdown takes effect.

The slogan used is “Roam Like at Home”, and Brussels promises “no bill shock anymore”. But there are still pitfalls that could leave holidaymakers seriously out of pocket.

Have roaming charges been abolished?

Within the 28 countries of the European Union, yes, roaming charges are no more. You do not need to set anything up; wherever you are in the EU, you will be treated as though you are in your home country. The mobile phone operator simply charges you domestic rates, or takes your roaming consumption from the allowances in your domestic mobile tariff.

But there are a couple of fair-use caveats, and, as not all European countries are covered, you could still inadvertently rack up high charges.

What’s the fair-use catch?

Two clauses are intended to ensure “fair use”. The first covers data roaming. While you can make as many voice calls and send as many texts as you like at domestic prices, there are special rules for data use. Beyond “a reasonably high volume” of roaming data at domestic rates, you may have to pay a data roaming surcharge of about £8.30 per gigabyte (€7.70/GB plus VAT). This will fall by 22 per cent next year, and continue to decline thereafter.

The second clause is intended to dissuade people from taking out a contract in a low-cost country (eg Bulgaria or Romania) and using it at home. The principle is: if you spend more time abroad than at home, and you use your mobile phone more abroad than at home, the mobile operator may impose roaming charges – which themselves are capped at roughly the 2016/17 levels.

Each time you cross an internal EU border, you should get a text message from your mobile operator to say that you’re roaming and reminding you of its fair-use policy.

If I’m in Spain and call a Spanish number, is it now treated as a local call?

Yes, even though the European Commission says: “The prices of calls from home to a foreign country, including in the EU, are not regulated.” In fact, the term “Roam Like at Home” is not quite accurate; the correct version should be “Roam More Cheaply than you do at Home”. As Money Saving Expert has pointed out, calls to any EU country are now really cheap – so long as you make them from any EU country that isn’t the UK.

What are the roaming rules for non-EU countries?

This is where it gets tricky. The three non-EU countries in the European Economic Area – Iceland, Norway and plucky Liechtenstein – will introduce Roam Like at Home “shortly after 15 June”, according to Brussels. But there are many other countries and territories that are not automatically covered by the new rules, including Switzerland, Monaco, Andorra and several Eastern European nations, as well as the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.

There is no consistency among operators about applying the same basic European rules to these destinations. For example, O2’s “Europe Zone” excludes Switzerland, Monaco, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.

When travelling anywhere outside the EEA, you should check exactly what your operator plans to charge you. If your operator charges, hook up to free WiFi in a cafe or hotel, and use a free or nearly free calling service such as Skype or WhatsApp. Or you could use a local payphone, if you can find one...

Turkey, where around 1.5 million British holidaymakers are expected to go this summer, is a particular concern: several operators apply charges that are completely disproportionate to the cost of providing the service. For example EE levies a fee of £1.50 per minute to make or receive calls and 50p for each text sent by customers on monthly contracts. Heading for Cyprus? You could inadvertently find you have joined a Turkish network, who provide services north of the “Green Line” on the divided island.

Do roaming fees apply on a ferry or cruise?

Yes, and they can be painfully high. Most European ferries and cruises in the Mediterranean, the Baltic and across the English Channel are between EU ports, but when you are offshore and using a satellite link to the ship, “roam like at home” does not apply. There are no caps on what the operator can charge: £3 a minute to make or receive calls is common, and data may be spectacularly expensive.

To stay in touch, you could use the on-board WiFi – which could still be pricey – for data use and make calls via Skype or WhatsApp. Or switch to manually selected networks to make sure your phone doesn’t select the ship’s high-tariff satellite link. Or just turn the thing off and enjoy the voyage.

What happens after Brexit?

No one knows. As citizens of a non-EU country, the British will have no automatic right to roam free telephonically.

Abta, the travel association, has demanded “we retain this highly valuable and pragmatic EU-level agreement once we leave the EU”.

It is possible that the UK will negotiate equivalent measures, or conversely that mobile-phone operators may reintroduce onerous charges. The eventual settlement is likely to be somewhere between the two.

The most beautiful airports to land at have been announced in a new survey - and the UK and Ireland are home to three of the top 10

Spring has officially sprung this week, which means that holidays close to home without weather warnings are becoming a distinct possibility. To mark the change of season, we asked Peter Irvine, author of new book Scotland the Best 100 Places, to pick the unknown spots that'll make a trip up north different from the usual lochs and Highlands routes.

The road trip motel: Mhor 84

Formerly a run-down roadside hotel, Mhor 84 has been transformed into a trendy motel, part of the ever stylish Mhor group (that also includes the well-known boutique hotel Monachyle Mhor). In fact, it was renovated so well that it’s now a destination in itself. Proudly advertising itself as a motel, this is as far from the mom and pop joints of Route 66 as you can get, and it’s the perfect stopover for Scotland’s dramatic west coast.

The gallery: Jupiter Artland

Based just outside Edinburgh, Jupiter Artland is a serene, psychedelic outdoor gallery that showcases some of the best in contemporary art and design. There’s work from the likes of Antony Gormley, Anish Kapoor and Marc Quinn, as well as tours, trails, and a programme of talks and events that run throughout the year.

The beach: Scarista

South Harris is home to some of Scotland’s most breath-taking and pristine beaches. Situated on the island’s Atlantic coast, Scarista beach is one of the most beautiful stretches of sand in the Outer Hebrides. Relax, enjoy the views and stay for the spectacular sunsets.

The club: Barrowlands

Regarded by many people as one of the best (if not the best) music venues in the UK, Glasgow’s Barrowlands is a live music institution. Steeped in rock ‘n’ roll history, the former ballroom re-opened as a live music venue in 1983, since when thousands of bands that have passed through its doors. Its legendary reputation is perhaps due to the unique combination of orchestral acoustics, a sprung dance floor and the reliably rowdy Glasgow audiences.

Outdoor swimming pools in Scotland are a thing (don't worry, this is heated) ( Angie Freeman)

The pool: Gourock

Outdoor pools in Scotland: as unlikely as it seems, they do exist, and they’re popular, too. Gourock Pool opened in 1909 and is still going strong – although maybe that’s because it’s heated. Open May to September, the pool offers midnight swimming sessions every Wednesday for those preferring a swim under the stars to Glasgow’s club scene.

The festival: Hebcelt

HebCelt is a world-renowned celebration of Celtic music, attracting music lovers from all over the world. The festival has taken place every year on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides since its inception in 1996. Set in the grounds of Lewis Castle, HebCelt takes over the whole town, bringing a carnival-styleatmosphere to the island. It’s the perfect place to soak up the best in Gaelic and world music against the backdrop of some of Scotland’s most spectacular shoreline.

The holiday cottages: Blackhouse Village

Another top hit on Lewis, The Blackhouse Village is unlike any other ‘holiday village’: a collection of squat, thatched cottages offering a truly authentic Scottish getaway. While basic, they make for deceptively cosy and rather romantic retreats – with the crashing Atlantic on your doorstep you’ll feel a world away from the hustle and bustle of the city.

The Walk: Knoydart

Looking for the ultimate opportunity to get away from it all? Knoydart – a peninsula over the Sound of Sleat – is often called Britain’s last true wilderness. No roads lead to Knoydart – instead, you’ll need to make the seventeen-mile hike from Kinloch Hourn. But it’s well worth it – once there, the views, atmosphere and sheer isolation are unrivalled.

The tea break: Inshriach Potting Shed

For a little slice of calm in Scotland’s wilder territories, Inshriach Nursery, which opened in 1938, has transformed an old potting shed into a tearoom offering many a tasty treat. But it’s not as twee as it sounds; outside, you’re looking at a mesmerizing and ever-changing commotion of birds and red squirrels in the surrounding woodlands. RSPB members have voted it one of the best places to see wild birds in the UK.

The secret garden: The Garden of Cosmic Speculation

In the grounds of an unsuspecting Georgian farmhouse north of Dumfries, lies an astonishing, extra-terrestrial garden of bridges, landforms and sculptures, created by American architectural theorist and landscape artist Charles Jencks. These beautifully crafted, ground-breaking gardens were created in 1988 as a tribute to Jencks’ wife Maggie and are open to the public a mere one day a year through the Scottish Garden Scheme.

The proportion of those who thought they had “good” or “very good” value is now at 35 per cent – the lowest level record - compared to more than 50 per cent five years ago.

In the biggest sector-wide survey of its kind, more than 14,000 undergraduates were asked questions on how hard they felt they were working and how satisfied they were with their lives, as well as their thoughts on recent government policies.

While the majority said they had learned “a lot”, and teaching quality appears to be improving year on year, perceptions of value for money was highlighted as a major concern among analysts.

The survey, from Higher Education Policy Unit and the Higher Education Academy also found student wellbeing to have declined overall, with just 14 per cent saying they felt satisfied with their lives.

Young women and LGBT students at university are particularly likely to feel unhappy, the survey found.

As in previous years, the majority of respondents were in favour of tuition fees being scrapped, and three-quarters of students felt that the new Teaching Excellence Framework-linked fee rises should not apply.

Students from ethnic minority backgrounds were found to be among the least satisfied, with just 11 per cent of Chinese students, 14 per cent of Asian and 18 per cent of black students agreeing with the statement “I have sufficient access to academic staff outside class”, compared with 21 per cent of their white peers.

Just 24 per cent of Asian students, 29 per cent of Chinese and 33 per cent of black students were of the belief their course was good value, compared to 36 per cent of white undergraduates.

Responding to the findings, Nick Hillman, Director of Hepi and co-author of the report, said much of the story was “positive”, but stressed that students were still less happy and more anxious than non-students.

“The survey proves beyond all doubt that the student experience differs depending on ethnicity, the type of accommodation and sexual orientation,” he said.

“Such factors have a direct impact on how engaged students are with their studies as well as on their overall quality of life. For a truly great academic experience, we need to think ever more deeply about how to respond to the individual characteristics of each student.”

Student numbers overall have taken a hit in the past year, with the total number of UK applicants falling five per cent on last year.

Those applying for places from other EU countries are also down by seven per cent – the first decrease in almost a decade.

Industry leaders have blamed rising tuition fees and threats to the reputation of UK universities as a result of Brexit for the fall in interest.

World university rankings published this week found the UK’s top institutions are slipping down the league tables, but analysts warned cuts to funding were more likely to blame than last year’s referendum.

Speaking ahead of Thursday’s general election vote, Mr Hillman added: “The election has seen a lively battle for student votes.

“Students want universities to provide information on where fees go, taxpayers to cover more of the costs and policymakers to provide stronger arguments for future fee rises. Above all, the Survey confirms higher education transforms lives but also that it does not currently help all students equally.’

Dame Julia Goodfellow, the president of Universities UK and vice-chancellor of the University of Kent, said: “Universities have increased investment in teaching and learning and are continuing to respond to student feedback.

"Students are now reporting record levels of satisfaction with their courses across all the UK’s universities, and that is down to the hard work and commitment of university staff.”

TOKYO Konica Minolta Inc (4902.T) said it was purchasing U.S. diagnostics company Ambry Genetics in a deal valued at up to $1 billion - an acquisition that marks a strategic shift for the Japanese firm's healthcare business as it seeks a leading position in precision medicine.

The deal is the largest ever for the photocopier maker, which has been seeking to diversify away its office equipment business. It pulled out of cameras about a decade ago.

Konica Minolta said its advanced imaging technology complemented privately held Ambry's genetic testing capabilities, with initial applications for combining the technologies seen in diagnosing hereditary cancer.

"Together with Ambry, we will have the most comprehensive set of diagnostic technologies for mapping an individual's genetic and biochemical makeup," Chief Executive Shoei Yamana said in a statement.

In a transaction that will be partially funded by a Japanese state-backed fund, Konica Minolta said $800 million would paid in cash upon closure of the deal while $200 million could be paid over two years depending on financial performance.

Konica Minolta, which has a market value of around $4 billion, will account for 60 percent of the investment, with the fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ) accounting for the remaining 40 percent.

INCJ, which was set up to help struggling Japanese companies, said it wanted to support the growth of the nation's medical industry. The state-backed fund is also part of the consortium picked as preferred bidder in the $18 billion sale of Toshiba Corp's (6502.T) chip unit.

South Korean barista Lee Kang-bin is pioneering "CreamArt" by drawing intricate designs on the layer of steamed milk that sits atop a coffee.

Mr Kang-bin's astounding creations include miniature imitations of famous paintings such as Vincent Van Gogh’s "The Starry Night" and "The Scream" by Edvard Munch.

Mr Kang-bin carefully etches the beautiful creations into the frothy layer on the top of a coffee using cream tinged with a palette of food dyes.

The delicate artistry takes him 15 minutes to complete and the coffees are sold for 10,000 won (£6.74) a cup at his shop "Café C. Through" in Seoul.

Disney favourites Bambi, Snow White and Winnie the Pooh also feature alongside startlingly realistic versions of Edgar Degas’s dancers and Leonardo DiCaprio portraits.

"One time I drew 'The Starry Night' and it looked so special as the famous painting placed on top of coffee. After that, lots of people ordered that coffee," Mr Kang-bin told Reuters.

On Instagram 161,000 users follow his CreamArt and frequently request versions of their favourite art works.

Despite never formally learning how to draw, his masterful designs have earned him a judge's seat at latte art competitions around the world.

Mr Kang-bin has been brewing coffee since he was 17 years old. He began making coffee while completing his compulsory military service and decided to buy his own machine and open a café for other soldiers in his camp.

South Korea is a new hub for the latte art scene with per capita coffee consumption almost doubling since 1990, according to the International Coffee Organisation.

Recent customer Kim Su-Kyung told Reuters: "I heard (on TV) that this barista draws these kinds of famous paintings. I think he has very talented hands."

This week I joined an exclusive club, a club with a very lucrative and specific membership list.



Having been elected as the President of the University of Salford’s Student Union and a National Executive Councillor of the NUS, I was chosen by the tabloid press for scrutiny.



The headlines started rolling in when tweets that I wrote as a teenager, at the beginning of sixth form college, caught people’s attention. The adolescent comments of a young girl were twisted to make them seem far more sinister than they ever were intended to be. “If I was President I’d oppress white people just to give them a taste of what they put us through! LMFAO” said one. In another, I said everyone should read the Quran; a separate one said that I didn’t think girls could be friends with guys and that there should be “boundaries” in those sorts of friendships because it was “Islamically not correct”.



There’s no doubt this collection of social media posts was supposed to make me seem like a fanatical Muslim and a threat to British society. I find it strange that I even have to clarify this, but for the avoidance of doubt I will (again): the comments clearly do not reflect my views today.

Muslim acid attack victim: 'I believe it was a hate crime'

In 2012, when the tweets were written, I was just 16 years old. I was struggling with my view of the world and my place in it. I was grappling with the deep injustices I could see around me and trying to figure out how I could make the world a better place.



For almost all teenagers who have gone through and will go through the same struggles and growth as I did, they will have the luxury of never having to worry about comments they made being dragged up years later.



For Muslims who take public roles in society – specifically, in this case, a black Muslim woman – it's not so simple.



It feels like the aim of this sort of article is to make politically active Muslims feel unwelcome in the public sphere. And it’s working. For 48 hours, I have had to sift through comments of hate, rape and death threats and attempts to intimidate me out of the public discourse. But I won’t be silenced.



I’m not the only target, of course. The press is full of attacks on young people like me, particularly within the student movement. It’s unfair and unnecessary treatment.



I said these things when I was young, impressionable and still developing my personality and opinions. In trying to paint me in this way, they failed to mention so much of who I am and what I do. In the past two years, I have done a wide variety of work on my campus and in the community in the hope for equality.

Muslim woman engages passionately with Camden Council leader Georgia Gould

They failed to mention that I volunteered at Bolton Solidarity Community Association, an organisation that exists to promote diversity and inclusivity. They failed to mention that I work with the Ramadan Tent Project, an interfaith initiative aiming to bring people from all walks of life together to share meals and conversations. They failed to mention that I was elected onto a national anti-racism and anti-fascist committee to tackle extremism in all its forms and protect all marginalised groups.

Young Muslims like me, who want to get involved in our communities and be politically active, are all too often shown that the minute we edge our toes out of private spheres, people will begin to riffle through everything we have ever said, done or thought just to discredit us. It’s a scary place to be when you’re at the beginning of your career.

Muslim Council of Britain: Newspapers are helping to spread Islamophobia

I am still learning and fighting the injustices around me. I will always try to make my society and world around me a better place. But this is not the picture that the right-wing media wants to portray of young Muslims. They often paint us as caricatures undeserving of empathy or understanding.They want to deny our humanity because they want you to be afraid of us.

We cannot allow this situation and allow this cycle to continue in Britain today. Because the first step of solving any problem is admitting there is one.

Day

3

This morning we approach Victoria Falls for an outstanding guided walking tour. The area around the falls is surrounded by a unique, lush rainforest eco-system, watered by the fine spray rising from the falls. As we pass through several rainbows arching through the mist, the roar of the falls intensifies and conversation becomes virtually impossible. The anticipation mounts and on your first view, you will fully appreciate why this is truly one of the wonders of the natural world! During low water flow, an optional boat trip is available to Livingstone Island from where the famous explorer himself first saw the falls. For the ultimate view you can take a helicopter or even a ‘micro-light’ aircraft flight (essentially a powered hang-glider) on an optional ‘Flight of Angels’ tour. During the afternoon we drive west parallel to the Zambezi until it joins the Chobe River, actually forming the Botswana border, which we cross on small open speedboats. We stay three nights half board at the four-star Chobe Safari Lodge (some groups may stay at the four-star Mowana Lodge), beautifully located overlooking the river itself. All the air-conditioned rooms are well furnished in an African theme and river-facing. The lodge, with its high-ceilinged thatch-roofed public areas blends superbly with the natural surroundings. It also has a lovely swimming pool overlooking the river and an open-air bar and restaurant.

路透联合国7月5日 - 美国周三警告称，如果为了阻止朝鲜核导弹计划而必须使用武力，将会这么做。但美国同时表示，更希望针对朝鲜不顾外界劝阻而发射导弹的行为采取全球性外交行动。

美国驻联合国大使黑利(Nikki Haley)在联合国安理会的一个会议上表示，朝鲜的行动正在“迅速关闭外交解决的可能性”，美国准备保护自己和盟友。

“我们的能力之一在于我们拥有相当强大的军事力量。如果我们必须使用武力，我们将会使用，但我们不希望不得不朝这个方向走，”黑利表示。她敦促朝鲜的唯一主要盟友--中国采取更多行动来约束朝鲜。

朝鲜的导弹计划又迈出重大一步，该国于周二试射一枚洲际弹道导弹，一些专家认为，该导弹射程可达美国阿拉斯加和夏威夷，或许还可达到美国西北部太平洋沿岸地区。

朝鲜称，此次试射的导弹可携带大型核弹头。

这次试射对美国总统特朗普而言是一个直接挑战。特朗普曾誓言要防范朝鲜拥有以核导弹打击美国的能力。

他一再敦促中国向朝鲜领导人施压，要求朝鲜放弃核计划。

黑利称，未来几天美国将建议联合国对朝鲜实施新的制裁，并警告称如果没有得到俄罗斯和中国的支持，那么“我们将按我们自己的方式来处理”。

她并未提供新制裁提议的细节，但列举了可能的选项。

黑利表示，“国际社会可切断朝鲜的主要硬通货来源。我们可以限制其军方和武器计划的燃油供应。我们可以加强航空和海运的限制。我们也可以将朝鲜高级官员列入制裁名单。”

外交人士称中国政府并未完全执行对朝鲜现有的国际制裁措施，并反对更为严厉的制裁举措，如石油禁运、禁止朝鲜航班入境和劳务输出、禁止中资银行和其他企业与朝鲜开展业务。

黑利表示，“联合国制裁能否全面执行主要取决于中国。”

美国官员表示，美国可能采取单边行动，并制裁更多的与朝鲜有业务往来的中国企业，特别是银行。

中国常驻联合国代表刘结一在安理会表示，朝鲜此次发射导弹是“公然违反”联合国决议，且“不能接受”。

他表示，“我们呼吁有关各方保持克制，避免挑衅行为和敌对语言，展现出无条件对话和努力缓和紧张局势的意愿。”(完)

"Amazing Thailand" - so the slogan goes. But while Thailand shines brightly on many fronts – its exuberant capital, mesmerising beaches, bucolic countryside, lip-smacking food – it is mirrored by a dark side, a far cry from the tourism authority's vision of paradise.

During my years living in the Land of Smiles, I heard almost daily tales of horrific motorbike, car, boat and bus accidents, scams and property frauds, drownings and diving incidents, stabbings, suicides and highly-suspicious deaths. Most distressing among them were the murders of British youngsters Hannah Witheridge and David Miller, who were brutally killed on the southern island of Koh Tao in 2014. At the time of the event, I was asked by an international news agency to gather some quotes from foreigners living on the island.

Resting in the Gulf of Thailand, a two-hour ferry ride north of Koh Samui, Koh Tao is best known for its incredible marine life, which over the years has attracted a small but buoyant expat community of around 2,000 people, many of whom run dive centres, restaurants and B&Bs. But my requests to long-time residents and business owners were met with fear, as they made it quite clear they felt their lives would be in danger if they spoke on the record. Off the record, however, they told of an island held in the iron grip of a mafia family, who demanded protection money, controlled the local police force and were not above attacking or burning down the homes and businesses of people that crossed them.

Later, the investigation into Ms Witheridge and Mr Miller's murders was widely criticised, with the police accused of incompetence, mismanagement and the scapegoating of two Burmese migrant workers, who are now awaiting the death penalty. With attention focused on the island, a number of other disturbing deaths soon came to light, including that of Nick Pearson, from Derby, who police concluded had fallen from cliffs and then drowned, and French tourist Dimitri Povse, who was found hanged with his hands tied behind his back. Since then, I have refused to visit the island, have strongly advised friends and family not to go and have declined to include Koh Tao in any of my travel-related articles. The recent discovery of the body of Elise Dallemange, the seventh young backpacker to have died in suspicious circumstances in just three years, has only strengthened my belief that Koh Tao is a place to be avoided at all costs.

Koh Tao may be beautiful but is allegedly controlled by a mafia family (Rex)

But while Koh Tao appears particularly troubling, corruption and mafia connections are not unique to the island. It's an open-secret that many of Thailand's most popular tourist resorts, including Phuket, Koh Samui and Phi Phi, are run by powerful families who control everything – from which vendors can sell pineapples on the beach to human trafficking, prostitution, and land rights. I was told by the general manager of one five-star hotel in Phuket that they had to include kick-back money in their budget to allow for building to go ahead.

Within a few weeks of arriving in the south, I also learnt that taxis are mafia controlled and charge up to 10 times more than you would pay in Bangkok; jet-ski operators are notorious for intimidating tourists into paying for fictional damages – never leave your passport as security – and if you do have a problem, the police are unlikely to help, although you should always report any crimes committed against you, for insurance purposes if nothing else. Violent attacks on women are also common enough for the Foreign Office to offer this advice:

“Violent sexual assaults and unprovoked attacks have been reported in popular tourist destinations, including in the Koh Samui archipelago and Krabi province. These are particularly common during the monthly Full Moon parties and generally occur late at night near bars.”

British family beaten unconscious at Thai beach resort

The FCO goes on to state: “Drink spiking has been reported in tourist destinations around Thailand, with both male and female victims.

So after three years living in Thailand would I say it’s safe to visit? Yes, for the most part. But I'm not going to sugar-coat it. You should take extra care when visiting the country. Do your research, avoid high-risk activities, never raise your voice to a Thai person (Thais hate confrontation and when they “lose face” often turn to violence) and ensure you have comprehensive travel insurance. And, for now, avoid Koh Tao.

A woman has spoken out about her struggle to have sex after childbirth in a bid to raise awareness of the difficulties new mums can face in the bedroom.

Zoe George, from Australia, who blogs at The Subtle Mummy, revealed that the difficult birth of her first baby, who was delivered by forceps, left her vagina “broken.”

And, that when she tried to sex with her husband six months later, it was a “nightmare.”

“It took this long before my husband even dared to bring it up,”she wrote.

“I was petrified. I have been bungee jumping before and the thought of having sex again scared me more.”

After struggling for a further six months, George decided to visit her gynaecologist who examined her and said that it was scar tissue from the stitches she had after the birth which were causing the problem.

“I could either have surgery to fix it or 'bear through it' until we conceived and then 'hope the next baby tears the same spot so that it can be re-stitched more carefully.

Ambrosia needs some help with her selfie angles but still a great pic 😂 Fun at Myuna farm again today. We love this place. A post shared by Zoe G (@thesubtlemummy) on Jun 15, 2017 at 9:17pm PDT

“I decided to give the latter option a go for one more month, and thankfully it worked.”

But then, the now mum to Ari, three, and Ambrosia, 18 months, was faced with another problem: vaginismus.

4/5 "I remember a lot of people feeling the need to tell me about stitches, tearing and episiotomies. This was my biggest fear both times while pregnant and it made me so anxious," says Megan Porter who lives in Falkirk.

5/5 Megan has two children a three-year-old and a two-week-old.

A condition which causes an involuntary reflex of the muscles surrounding the entrance to the vagina, vaginismus can make penetration painful and in some instances impossible.

The NHS says that it can be caused by damage to the vagina during childbirth, disrupt or completely stop your sex life, and lead to relationship problems.”

However, vaginismus can be treated with appropriate medication if there is a physical cause, while sex therapy and physiotherapy may be recommended if the cause is psychological.

As a result, George went through specialist physiotherapy but admits that she as a “long way to go” before she is “100 per cent relaxed down there.”

“I have been embarrassed to write this story for a while, but every time I meet someone in person and tell them they are surprised and feel really terrible for me that I went through it,” she concluded.

“I am mortified at the thought of my family reading it, but it’s all for the greater good, I say.”

Aston Martin debuted an AMR Pro package for its track-only Vulcan supercar at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, revealing several aerodynamic improvements and shorter gearing to lower lap times.





While the standard Vulcan came with a large rear wing and front splitter, the AMR Pro package adds more carbon fibre winglets to the front bumper and an extra layer to the rear wing, helping generate more grip at higher speeds.



There are also several turning vanes "beneath the front splitter to aid steering response", says AutoExpress, while a redesigned engine cover shaves 11lbs from the car's weight.



The package also sees a "surge in maximum downforce", allowing Vulcan AMR Pro models to generate more aerodynamic grip than Aston's "Le Mans class winning Vantage GTE".



However, says Autocar, the British carmaker is only offering the package as a retrofit to the owners of all 24 Vulcans and there are no plans to extend production for factory-made AMR Pro models.



It adds that the package is expected to cost in the region of "between £100,000 and £150,000" - "a small percentage of the original Vulcan price of £1.8 million".



Visitors to this year's Goodwood Festival of Speed, which finishes on 2 July, will be among the first to see the car, as Aston Martin will be running a Vulcan AMR Pro up the hillclimb all weekend.

On Thursday 11 May an article referred to Justin Trudeau as Canada’s President. He is, of course, Prime Minister of the country.

A piece published on 8 May initially reported that the unstunned slaughter of animals had been outlawed in Wallonia and that kosher and halal meat had thus been banned as a consequence. In fact, while the Environment Committee of the Walloon Parliament has voted to prohibit unstunned slaughter (with a proposed start date for the ban of 1 September 2019), the plan has yet to be approved by Parliament in full plenary session. The proposal will be debated by Wallonia’s parliamentarians later this month.

Defending world long jump champion Greg Rutherford has been ruled out of the Anniversary Games in London on July 9 with an ankle ligament injury but hopes to recover in time for the World Championships in August, the 30-year-old has said.

Rutherford has struggled with injuries this year and underwent scans on his ankle after winning the long jump event at the Gavardo meeting in Italy last month. He also missed the British team trials last Saturday.

"After some really excellent training this year, the start to the season has been riddled with a series of troublesome injuries, most recently a problem with an ankle ligament," Rutherford said in a statement on his verified Twitter account.

"As a result, I am absolutely gutted to say that I am unable to compete at the Anniversary Games this weekend -- one of the greatest events in our sport."

"Obviously this isn't ideal, but I am doing everything to give myself the best chance of success at the World Championships in London... "

The former Olympic champion is scheduled to defend his title at the World Championships being held from Aug. 4-13.

Simon Harris, the health minister, said cancer prevention would form a key part of the overall strategy GARETH CHANEY/COLLINS

The government has committed to matching the best cancer survival rates in Europe despite cases of the disease being set to double by 2040.

The pledge is at the centre of the ten-year National Cancer Strategy, which involves spending of more than €100 million a year on cancer treatment.

The “patient focused” document makes 52 recommendations including increased screenings for early detection, an age-appropriate facility for adolescents with cancer and wider access to psychological support services for patients who have completed therapy.

It will also establish a number of positions, including a national lead for cancer molecular diagnostics, and clinical leads in geriatric oncology and cancer nursing.

The HSE’s National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) will implement the strategy and it will also develop a cancer…

Northern Ireland could be back under direct rule from Westminster if its political parties fail to reach a deal by today's extended deadline for power-sharing talks.

However, although it is unlikely the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein will reach an agreement in time, they could be granted a reprieve.

Unionist sources told the Belfast Telegraph they believe Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire will suspend talks until after July to allow the politicians to take their holidays.

"He can introduce direct rule or call another Assembly election in the autumn, but talks insiders believe he will opt for continuing discussions between the parties at Stormont after a break," adds the paper.

If direct rule were imposed, it would be for the first time since 2007, when Tony Blair was prime minister, the BBC reports.

It would need a law to be passed in Parliament suspending the Northern Ireland Assembly, after which the government would take control of issues such as policing, prisons, transport and housing, which are devolved to Stormont.

The province has been governed by Westminster for 32 out of the last 44 years.

According to Professor Rick Wilford of Queen's University Belfast in agendaNi magazine, it would also "marginalise" the province's voice and give more power to the wants of Westminster.

He adds: "Should [direct rule] be renewed again, then expect an expanded Northern Ireland Office pursuing a largely unbridled UK government agenda, not least in relation to Brexit, and a severely diminished level of parliamentary scrutiny."

The man and the Irish teenager wrestle over the towel thrown into the crowd by Jack Sock

A boy who had a memento snatched from his grasp at Wimbledon will be given a replacement by his tennis hero after making contact through a social networking site.

The Irish teenager, whose mother asked for him not to be named, tried to catch a towel thrown by Jack Sock, the American player, at the end of Sock’s first-round match against Christian Garin of Chile.

The boy caught it at the same time as a woman, who relinquished it, but a large man sitting next to the woman then grabbed the towel and insisted that it was his.

Sock appealed for the boy to come forward and said through his agent that the boy had replied in a direct message on Instagram.

Trump again demands more NATO spending, mulls 'severe things' on North Korea

Now it may be that we all wake up on 9 June to learn that Theresa May’s gamble has paid off. She will have won her snap election by a landslide; she will have several dozen more Conservative MPs to swing any Commons vote, and she will have secured the best possible mandate, personal and political, to embark on negotiating the terms of Brexit.

Just maybe, though, she won’t.

Recent polls suggesting a hung parliament or even a Conservative defeat look implausible, though it would be life-enhancing to believe that this election has turned from a walkover into a proper contest. And the spread of results indicated in the polling generally – from a parliament with no overall majority to a Conservative majority in double, or even triple, digits – looks impossibly wide: someone’s calculations have to be very wrong.

Yet there does appear to be a consensus on one point: the polls have narrowed, so that the sweeping majority Theresa May had banked on – and the pre-campaign polls seemed to promise – is not as much of a foregone conclusion as it once was.

Whether this is because Jeremy Corbyn’s appeal was underestimated, or because the personalisation of the Conservatives’ campaign around May was ill-advised, or because the “dementia tax” debacle and the Manchester bombing refocused the campaign away from Brexit, or for some other as yet undefined reason, will be for the post-election analysts to judge. But it is not necessary to entertain the prospect of a hung parliament or even a Conservative defeat – let’s not push the speculation too far – to realise that anything less than a substantially increased Conservative majority will amount to a defeat for Theresa May. It will also, once again, alter the political calculus around Brexit.

Take the Prime Minister first. She called an early election, despite months of insisting that she would not do so, on the basis of exceptionally favourable opinion polls and a well-founded hope of gaining a stronger parliamentary mandate for the Brexit negotiations that was also hers. If she fails to achieve this, it is hard to see how her position will be tenable, either as leader of her party – calling the election would have to be considered as great a misjudgment as David Cameron’s decision to call the referendum – or as head of a government set to steer the bargaining with Brussels.

So far, May has declined to answer questions about how she might respond to an election result that leaves the Conservatives little better off than before, though she has said that, if re-elected, she would serve out a full five-year term. And few leaders commit to resigning before the worst has actually happened. Cameron did not, even though it was obvious that a lost referendum would give him little choice, and May will not do so either. How long she could continue in office after a poor result, however, is a valid question. There are reports of knives being sharpened already in the Conservative hierarchy.

The implications of a surprise result for Brexit and the Brexit talks are, if anything, even greater than for Theresa May. What would it mean that a prime minister who went to the country seeking an explicit parliamentary mandate for Brexit had essentially been rebuffed? (And this would surely be the significance of anything less than a clearly increased majority.)

As seen from Brussels – or Berlin or Paris – the British bargaining position would be substantially weakened. The Government’s mandate would be a lot less convincing than it would have been without a vote. How would any UK prime minister then proceed?

One consequence could be that the initiative passes from the Government to Parliament. Given that the election post-dated the referendum, a slim victory for May (or less) could encourage those many MPs with misgivings about Brexit to take another look at the “will of the people”. They could well argue that now an election had been fought on Brexit – after all, this is what Theresa May intended, even though many other issues came to cloud the vote – the “will of the people” was rather less clear.

General Election polls and projections: June 1

Whether there would be a sufficient number of MPs prepared to challenge the legitimacy of Brexit, or call for a new referendum, or – as the Liberal Democrats propose – legislate for a referendum on the actual terms of Brexit, would probably depend on many other considerations. But there could well be tempestuous times in the new parliament that would throw many of the May Government’s Brexit calculations up in the air.

The nub of the problem is this: an election result along the lines predicted when it was called, a big majority for Theresa May, could indeed bolster the Government’s negotiating position in the eyes of Brussels, while helping also to confirm acceptance of Brexit at home. But a different result – including one that falls short of those initial expectations, if only by a relatively small number – would have the opposite effect. Not only could it encourage Brussels to drive a harder bargain, but it could reopen the still raw Brexit wounds in the UK.

Of course, none of this may happen. It may well be that we wake up on the morning after the night before to hear an exultant Prime Minister claim a famous victory. In which case, it is game on for Brexit and for the talks scheduled to begin less than two weeks later.

If the result is anything less than that famous victory, however, the UK will be plunged into new political uncertainty, with pretty much everything that has happened in politics over the past year called into question. There would be fury among Brexiteers, a flickering of hope among Remainers, and a rejoining of the Conservatives’ internecine Europe war.

Whether that is a prospect to be welcomed or feared, I leave to your judgement as readers – and voters.

Barcelona 0 Juventus 0 [Juventus win 3-0 on aggregate)

No goals, no drama and no stunning comeback this time from Barcelona. After their extraordinary exploits last month, when they overturned a 4-0 first-leg deficit in the second leg against Paris Saint-German, the Spanish club found Juventus less accommodating.

Surely there is no more remarkable statistic in the competition's recent history than the fact that Juventus have yet to concede a goal from open play in this season's tournament.

Barcelona did create opportunities but Lionel Messi was denied by Gianluigi Buffon in the Juventus goal and neither Luis Suarez nor Neymar could capitalise on the chances that came their way.

In all Barcelona had 19 shots but managed just one on target, as they exited the Champions League at the quarter-final stage for the second consecutive season.

Juventus carved out a couple of chances themselves but, on a night when accuracy in front of goal was at a premium, Gonzalo Higuain and Juan Cuadrado squandered their opportunities.

Not that it mattered and it's Juventus who take their place in Friday's semi-final draw alongside Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid and Monaco.

"It's a step forward. We deserved qualification against a top level team," said Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri. "Barcelona not scoring over two legs is almost unheard of... We did very well defensively, less in attack because we failed to make the most of some very promising counter-attacks by missing some simple passes."

Only two other clubs have shut out Barcelona over two legs of a Champions League fixture – Manchester United in 2007-08 and Bayern Munich in 2012-13 – and their coach conceded they deserved to exit the competition.

"We tried with all our might but we couldn't find the route to goal," said Luis Enrique, who is leaving Barcelona at the end of the season. "We played a very poor first half in Turin and that has cost us dearly."

The victory over Barcelona keeps Juventus on course for a treble, as they are eight points clear at the top of Serie A and facing Lazio in the final of the Coppa Italia.

"The players need to realise that they can do even better and we are slowly improving," said Allegri. "We must not get ahead of ourselves... I am happy with what the lads are doing but the key is not to maintain current form, instead we are aiming to improve it."

Why are we asking this now?

The Jungle refugee and migrant camp in Calais will be closed by the end of the year, French President Francois Hollande has said - so what does that mean for the current residents?



What is the Jungle camp?

The sprawling camp, which has been nicknamed the “Jungle” by residents, is based in Calais, northern France, around nine miles from the Channel Tunnel. It has become home for thousands of migrants hoping to seek asylum in the UK.

What is the history of the camp?

The Sangatte refugee camp was opened in Calais in 1999, but was closed between 2001 and 2002 by Nicolas Sarkozy, who was then minister of interior. The closure failed to stem the flow of arrivals and migrants continued to settle and build makeshift camps around the port town. The population of the Jungle has soared in recent years.

How many people live there?

Estimates of the numbers of refugees and migrants in the Jungle vary. While authorities put the figure at around 7,000, a census conducted in August by Help Refugees found more than 9,000 people were living there. The figure marked a 29% increase in the population since early July, the charity said.

France’s Hollande visits Calais, vowing to close ‘Jungle’

Where do they come from?

Many people are believed to be fleeing from countries embroiled in conflict. Reports suggest people have arrived from countries including Eritrea, Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia and Sudan.

Why is the Jungle back in the headlines?

Mr Hollande has announced that the French government is preparing to “completely, definitively” dismantle the Jungle by the end of the year. Half the Calais camp was dismantled in March, but its population is believed to have doubled since then.

What will happen to the people who live in the Jungle?

The occupants of the camp are set to be moved to reception centres across France. Between 40 and 50 will be held at each centre for up to four months while authorities investigate their cases. Those who do not seek asylum will be deported.

What will the camp's closure mean for child refugees hoping to gain asylum in the UK?

Under EU legislation known as Dublin III, asylum claims must be made in the first safe country a person reaches - but children can have their claim transferred to another country if they have family members living there.

Campaigners have urged the British government to ensure unaccompanied children are not caught up in the eviction and are removed safely from the camp, so that they can be reunited with their families.

BEIJING A raft of Chinese data in coming weeks is expected to show steady growth in the world's second-biggest economy, but government measures to rein in the housing market and debt risks are likely to drag on activity over the next few quarters.

Many analysts say Beijing's deleverging campaign will pressure growth as the property sector cools in response to policy curbs, even as top leaders have pledged to maintain economic stability ahead of a key party meeting later this year.

"We expect June's data release to show overall steady growth with industrial production momentum maintained," economists at UBS said in a research note.

"Slower credit growth and higher funding costs due to supervisory tightening are expected to have an effect on fixed-asset investment and activities later in the year."

China's industrial output is seen up 6.5 percent in June from a year earlier, matching the rise in May, according to a Reuters poll of 34 economists.

Retail sales were expected to grow 10.6 percent, easing slightly from a 10.7 percent rise in May, while fixed-asset investment was predicted to increase 8.5 percent in January-June from a year earlier, versus a rise of 8.6 percent in the first five months, the poll showed.

Authorities have tightened rules to force banks to deleverage - as part of steps to control debt risks, pushing up money market rates that have started to spill over into the real economy.

Moody's Investors Service downgraded its credit rating in May, saying it expects the country's financial strength will erode in coming years as growth slows and debt continues to rise.

Policy insiders say the central bank will hold off on further monetary policy tightening and could even slightly loosen its grip in the coming months to support economic growth and job creation.

China's exports are seen up 8.7 percent in June from a year earlier, while imports are set for a 13.1 percent rise, according to the Reuters poll, producing a trade surplus of $42.4 billion.

China's exports rose a stronger than expected 8.7 percent in May as global demand improved, while imports jumped 14.8 percent despite falling commodity prices.

GDP PUZZLE

China will release second-quarter gross domestic product(GDP) on July 17, along with June industrial output, retail sales and January-June fixed asset investment.

Analysts are awaiting a few other June data releases before fine-tuning their April-June GDP forecasts, though some expect it will be slightly weaker than the solid first quarter pace of 6.9 percent.

Both the official and private factory surveys painted a robust picture for June thanks to stronger demand, though even here signs of stress were evident in median and small firms.

China's producer price index (PPI)) is tipped to rise 5.5 percent in June from a year earlier, flat from May when factory gate inflation eased for the third straight month on tumbling raw materials prices.

The consumer price index (CPI) is seen up 1.5 percent year-on-year in June, also matching that in May, when consumer inflation quickened from April's 1.2 percent.

Beijing is targeting consumer inflation at 3 percent this year, unchanged from 2016.

Besides the campaign to reduce high levels of debt across the economy, authorities have also been busy trying to stabilize the yuan by curbing capital outflows.

That seems to have paid off with the currency pushing higher against the dollar in recent months. And China's foreign exchange reserves are expected to edge up in June to $3.06 trillion, rising for a fifth consecutive month as capital curbs and a weakening dollar helped staunch money outflows.

China is due to announce foreign exchange reserves data on Friday, followed by inflation and trade data on Monday and Thursday respectively, while loan and money data is expected anytime from July 10-15.

LOANS SEEN UP AMID SHADOW BANKING CRACKDOWN

Loan data will also be closely watched for signs of whether the economy continued to build up more debt, amid signs that banks have shifted more credit back onto their books in response to the shadow financing clampdown.

Chinese banks are seen extending 1.2 trillion yuan ($176.47 billion) in new loans in June, up from 1.11 trillion yuan in May.

Combined trust loans, entrusted loans and undiscounted bankers' acceptances, which are common forms of shadow banking activity, fell sharply to 28.9 billion yuan in May from 177 billion yuan in April, according to Reuters calculations based on central bank data.

Tallinn, one of Europe’s newest capitals, boasts a rich mix of architecture and culture in a small geographic area. Its Old Town was almost untouched by war and remains perfectly preserved. And outside the city walls there are beguiling districts of brightly painted wooden houses, parks, redeveloped docks, beaches and forests.

There are still stag dos and plenty of bars where Finns fresh off the Helsinki ferry chug bargain beers, but Tallinn is also a cultured place that attracts visitors who wants more than just a cheap drink: Baltic, Nordic, Teutonic and Russian cultures meld in food, art, design and music. The annual Tallinn Music Week (27 March-2 April) showcases Estonia’s growing rock and electronic music scene in venues including the city’s old power station (kultuurikatel.ee).

The city has a surprisingly modern, sophisticated air: trams and buses (free for the locals) make everything easily accessible and old warehouses are being converted into new spaces for business and culture. Free wifi and a nascent tech scene (Skype was developed here) show this is a city looking forward as well as to its traditional, folkloric roots.

Song Festival Grounds

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Crowd at Estonian National Song Festival in Tallinn. Photograph: Getty Images

Every five years (the next one is in July 2019) Tallinn has its Last Night of the Proms moment as 30,000-odd singers from 1,000 choirs belt out traditional anthems to the white, blue and black flag-waving masses who gather for the Song Festival, which began in 1869 and has developed into one of Estonia’s key cultural get-togethers. The sprawling grassy bowl is the perfect place for a Sunday stroll, while the huge shell-like structure on which the singers stand is a modernist treat designed in 1959 by Alar Kotli. A previous stage stood on the site from the 1920s but the one that soars over the park today was built to accommodate the vast numbers of singers and spectators who flock to the event – and its popularity, which mirrors feelings of “Estonian-ism” in the country continues to rise. The stories in the songs and the use of the Estonian language to sing them reach deep into the heart of the Estonian soul and collective culture.

Estonian Architecture Museum

This is the perfect place to start exploring the Rotermann Quarter – a former industrial district that’s being turned into shops, offices and flats. This chunky old salt warehouse at the heart of the neighbourhood houses the museum and is chocka with models of the most interesting buildings in town, such as 23 Roosikrantsi Street by Robert Natuse – an expressionist gem built of dark bricks and with a pointed prow that recalls the Chilehaus in Hamburg, plus a model of a huge planned seaside sanatorium in Estonia’s coastal city, Parnu, which was never built. There are fascinating hand-drawn plans (mostly from the Soviet era) for overblown reconstructions of Tallinn city centre, crowned with towerblocks and megastructures. Again the plans never came to fruition because of the sums involved, and a sense that the history of the city was worth preserving. However, there are some big bits of bluster from the communist age around Tallinn – like the Viru Hotel’s skyscraper slab and the Linnahall, an evocative, crumbling wreck destined to be transformed into a concert venue and conference centre.

Von Krahl

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Luis Dafos/Getty Images

A handsome traditional stone pub and theatre in Tallinn’s Old Town, where buildings jostle against the hillside, Von Krahl is all steep steps and characterful wooden beams on a street (Rataskaevu) that dates back to the 1700s. The team behind it took over the place in 1992 as Communism ended and free expression widened in Tallinn. Today, all kinds of left-field plays are put on here and one of the most recent was titled Hipsteri Surm, which translates as “Hipster Death”. Bands stop off too. Hundreds jammed in during Tallinn Music Week (see above) last year to see Estonian neo-folk trio Trad.Attack!, who sample one of their member’s late granny’s vocals on upbeat, dancey tracks.

Umami



With its mid-century furniture and local artists’ paintings on the wall, Umami is cool – yet far removed from the showiness those places often suffer from. This is the second restaurant from Janno Lepik and Kristjan Peäske; the first is Leib, in the old town. Warm staff, an open kitchen and a family-friendly vibe go alongside food such as local cod and salads with rocket and beetroot. Umami is inside an old house on the edge of a park in the Mustamae district, which – along with the laid-back atmosphere – makes it feel more like you’re going to someone’s for dinner than out to a restaurant.

Lennusadam Seaplane Harbour

Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Lembit submarine in the main hall of the Seaplane Harbour Museum. Photograph: Alamy

If visiting a seaplane hangar sounds boring, stick with us – this 100-year-old concrete behemoth is cavernous, and miraculously has no supports inside. It was put up to house seaplanes for the Tsar’s navy in 1916 and has survived a century’s tumult in Tallinn. In its new iteration as a museum (opened in 2012 after the threatened hangar was saved and restored), the planes are back. They date from the first world war, and there are boats and submarines from the 1930s to the 1990s. The punchy lighting, huge fans and dramatic walkways inside make it look more like a nightclub, which it sometimes is.

TV Tower

One of the best things about a trip to the Teletorn (TV Tower) is the bus ride out through the bottle green pine forests that fringe Tallinn. The tower is a classic of Soviet design – raw concrete reaching for the sky and screaming about how technologically advanced the socialist society was in the 1970s (despite some indicators to the contrary). At the top you can be buffeted by the breeze on an outdoor platform – and even peer over the Baltic to Finland on a clear day.

• teletorn.ee

Levier Cakery

The fascinating district of Kalamaja is worth a walk. Just get off the tram at the Balti Jaam stop and head north, away from the Old Town, where you’ll find streets that look as if they’ve been airlifted in from Reykjavik – homes made from corrugated iron and wooden slats painted yellow, cream and blue. In the midst of the area several cafes keep locals happy, such as Levier. The outdoor tables are the ones to grab, and there’s a big nod towards France: macarons and elegant patisserie are stacked up by the counter.

Pirita

For an easy day out, take the 34 bus from Viru Square to the pleasant coastal suburb of Pirita, to the east of Tallinn. There are sweeping views of the city’s harbour and skyline from its pretty promenade and long, sandy beach. Men fish in the Pirita river where it enters the Baltic, and this is the site of the Olympic Village, accommodation for sailing teams during the Moscow 1980 Olympics (the complex is now a spa hotel). The Russian influence is obvious on the waterfront Maarjamäe war memorial, designed by Allan Murdmaa and Matti Varik in 1975, with its concrete sculptures commemorating fallen Red Army soldiers.

No 99



This attractive old theatre has a wonderful art deco cafe with dark colours and a classy vibe reflecting Estonia’s golden age in the 1920s and 30s, when it was an independent nation expressing itself artistically with the new styles of the age. It’s a perfect embodiment of the elegance and restraint of the city and was the venue Estonia’s music-mad former president Toomas Hendrik Ilves chose to DJ at during last year’s Tallinn Music Week. He played tracks from his charity mix album Teenage Wasteland by MC5, The Who, New York Dolls and David Bowie.

Telliskivi Loomelinnak or just “Telliskivi” as locals say (the other bit means “creative city”) is a fascinating collection of old railway buildings (though those same locals posit that there was actually secret military manufacture going on here, too) near Tallinn’s main station. Today’s it’s home to creatives’ studios, nightclubs, a cycle shop that doubles as a bar (jooks.cc). One of the first businesses to move here was little restaurant F Hoone, which has a relaxed vibe, bare brick walls, traditonal Estonian grub, and a helpful map of Tallinn printed across the floor.

OTTAWA Canada's Liberal government will apologise to former Guantanamo Bay inmate Omar Khadr and pay him around C$10 million (£6 million) in compensation, two sources close to the matter said on Tuesday, prompting opposition protests.

A Canadian citizen, Khadr was captured in Afghanistan in 2002 at age 15 after a firefight with U.S. soldiers. He pleaded guilty to killing a U.S. Army medic and became the youngest inmate held at the military prison in Cuba.

Khadr later recanted and his lawyers said he had been grossly mistreated. In 2010, the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that Canada breached his rights by sending intelligence agents to interrogate him and sharing the results with the United States.

The case proved divisive: defenders called Khadr a child soldier while the then-Conservative government dismissed calls to seek leniency, noting he had pleaded guilty to a serious crime.

"Meet Canada's newest multi-millionaire – Omar Khadr," said the Conservatives as they unveiled a protest petition.

Tony Clement, the Conservative Party's public safety spokesman, said "it is one thing to acknowledge alleged mistreatment, but it is wrong to lavishly reward a convicted terrorist who murdered an allied soldier who had a wife and two children".

Khadr spent a decade in Guantanamo before being returned to Canada in 2012 to serve the rest of his sentence. He was released on bail in 2015 and lives in Edmonton, Alberta.

The Canadian government and Khadr's lawyers agreed on the compensation deal, said the sources, who asked to remain anonymous given the sensitivity. Canada has reached a series of expensive settlements with citizens imprisoned abroad who alleged Ottawa was complicit in their mistreatment.

Khadr, 30, had sued Ottawa for C$20 million on grounds of violating his human rights. News of the settlement was broken by the Globe and Mail newspaper.

A spokesman for Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale declined to comment. Khadr's lawyers did not respond to a request for comment. The U.S. Embassy was closed for the July Fourth holiday.

Khadr was taken to Afghanistan by his father, an al Qaeda member, who apprenticed the boy to a group of bomb makers. The father died in a battle with Pakistani forces in 2003.

"It is the right decision in light of the callous and unlawful treatment meted out to Mr. Khadr with the complicity of Canadian officials," said Ihsaan Gardee, executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims.

Ah for the days when the United Kingdom – or the British Isles, as we then called ourselves – was still a byword for the political stability that seemed so conspicuously absent elsewhere. Our image today is very different.

It is less than a year since a divisive referendum unexpectedly reversed more than half a century of UK foreign policy. Now a general election, one called expressly to strengthen the Government’s mandate to negotiate the split with the European Union, has resulted in a hung Parliament. The Prime Minister’s campaign slogan of “strong and stable” leadership could hardly ring more hollow.

As Nick Clegg, one of this country’s most committed Europeans, set out in no uncertain terms as he surveyed the post-electoral wreckage: “It is impossible to exaggerate... how self-absorbed and adrift the UK looks to the rest of Europe… I can’t think of any example of a modern mature democracy putting itself in such a vulnerable position.”

The former deputy prime minister was speaking the morning after he had lost his parliamentary seat to the Labour Party’s surge.

Lib Dem's Layla Moran, first MP of Palestinian heritage, makes victory speech

Even if, as it appears at the time of writing, Theresa May forms a government supported by the Democratic Unionist Party, the composition of Parliament and the whole political landscape has changed. May went to the country with two objectives: to obtain the personal mandate she lacked because of the way she was propelled to Downing Street in the meltdown that followed the referendum; and to strengthen the Government’s hand as it embarked on what were expected to be complex and difficult bargaining with Brussels.

In the event, the Conservatives lost seats and their majority. As the former Labour leader, Ed Miliband, put it: “We know Theresa May can't now negotiate Brexit for Britain because she told us losing majority would destroy her authority – and it has.”

This is the nub of the problem that now confronts the UK. An election intended to strengthen the country’s negotiating position has left it weakened. If truth were told, the balance of advantage was already turning. After their initial shock at the Brexit vote, the other 27 EU members seemed to be discovering a unity and sense of purpose that had seemed to elude the European Union when it met at 28.

The euro has been strengthening, even as the UK’s economy began to languish. The sweeping victory of Emmanuel Macron in France held out the prospect of a new dynamism within the EU. Such hitherto divisive issues as migration and integrated EU defence seemed to be attracting a growing consensus. That might be more impression than reality – migration (from outside the EU), rather than “free movement” (migration of peoples inside the EU), remains hugely contentious – but the 27 seemed to be looking for joint solutions in a way that the UK’s very presence seemed to have obstructed.

“Self-absorbed and adrift,” Clegg rightly said – and he was referring to us.

General Election 2017: The biggest shocks

And if, as it appears for the time being, May clings to Number 10, she will be weakened on two fronts: with her party in a delicate de facto coalition in Parliament at home, and in relation to the EU abroad.

This was apparent from the early responses from Brussels. The designated chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, suggested that the timetable for talks might be adjusted. The head of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, however, insisted that talks should begin as soon as possible. “We can start at 9.30 tomorrow morning,” he said pointedly. In both instances, it was abundantly, embarrassingly, clear who held the more cards.

The Government’s weakened position will also make it harder (and it was already hard) for the UK to project itself as a global player and trader. How much conviction will those efforts carry if, as is likely, all government attempts to legislate for Brexit, including the so-called Grand Repeal Bill, face challenges from a rejuvenated opposition?

It was not immediately apparent from the breakdown of the UK’s vote how far people were voting on Brexit (the whole point of holding the election) and how far the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, had successfully shifted the focus on to social policy and away from Europe. There was evidence, however, that Labour had become – at least in some constituencies that had voted strongly against Brexit – the “soft Brexit” party.

This seems to have been a construction put on Labour’s policy by the voters, rather than something Labour had actively campaigned on. The party’s own internal divisions on Europe had encouraged it to avoid the subject. For pro-Remain constituencies to have voted in many cases strongly for Labour, however, suggests that Labour could reasonably reposition itself in Parliament as the “soft Brexit” party.

This, in turn, could have two opposite effects. On the one hand it could complicate May’s ability to win parliamentary votes even further and lead to stalemate in London. If, on the other hand, the Government took its cue from the election result and moderated its apparent attachment to a “hard Brexit”, negotiations with the EU could run more smoothly. Corbyn’s pledge of permanent residence for all EU nationals currently in the UK would be the sort of opening gesture the last government held out against. Maybe that will change.

It is far too early to broach the possibility of a new referendum (at the conclusion of negotiations, perhaps) or to hazard that Labour might, despite its manifesto, think again about leaving the EU Single Market – a precondition for ending “free movement”.

But a weaker UK negotiating with a stronger EU could, paradoxically, make the bargaining easier. It would do nothing for the UK’s often exaggerated view of its stature, however. The EU referendum left the UK diminished internationally – a smaller, more parochial power. The inconclusive election only compounds the damage.

Japan’s new narrow-gauge wonder-train has proved so successful that it has completely sold out until April 2018 — despite a price tag that works out at up to £2 per minute. Even before the first run, on 1 May, demand has been so high that bookings have been allocated by lottery.

The Shiki-Shima is an extraordinary creation: a futuristic 10-coach train running on 3ft 6in-gauge lines and carrying a maximum of 34 passengers, who enjoy the most luxurious experience on the rails.

Shiki-Shima: The world's most luxurious train?

The train is the latest excursion venture by the East Japan Railway Company. Its basic three-night/two-day “summer tour” starts from Ueno station in Tokyo. Lunch and dinner are served as the train rolls north to the mountain resort of Yuzawa and passengers acquaint themselves with the facilities on board.

Five of the 10 coaches are filled by the standard suites — three to a carriage, offer comfortable beds and a bathroom with shower and toilet. Another has just two “deluxe suites", each with an aromatic cypress wood bath.

There is also an observation car at either end from which to watch the scenery roll past, a lounge and a dining car with Michelin accreditation. Service on board is by uniformed butlers.

The name Shiki-Shima means “Island of Four Seasons”. Even by the standards of luxury trains, it is expensive: a solo traveller taking a standard suite can pay the equivalent of £7,500, which works out at £2 for every minute of the 60-hour trip.

The train's top speed is just 70mph, barely one-third of that achieved in normal service by some Bullet Trains in Japan. As with the new Japanese-designed trains for the Great Western Railway in Britain, it is equipped with both electric motors and diesel engines.

After dinner on the first night, passengers are given a live performance of the traditional Japanese “Dance of the Dead” — which the company says has been designated “An Important Intangible Folk Cultural Property".

The train rolls on through the night to Hachinohe, on the Pacific shore almost at the northern tip of the island of Honshu. Here, oddly, passengers transfer to a different luxury train, the Tohoku Emotion, which has “an open kitchen where you can watch your food being prepared while you wait”.

This train trundles along the coast to Kuji, where passengers disembark for a sightseeing trip.

After the return to Hachinohe and re-boarding the Shiki-Shima, dinner is served as the train meanders south to Naruko-onsen, a spa town set amid mountain scenery. After immersion in the “hot springs village”, passengers retire to their luxury suites.

The train slows to a crawl for the short overnight journey to Ichinoseki — prospective home for the International Linear Collider, a scientific research project which could help the search for dark matter. Passengers will be taken by bus to neighbouring Hiraizumi, home to a Unesco-listed temple complex.

Back on the train, one more lunch is served as the train returns to Tokyo.

QUETTA, Pakistan Gunmen on Thursday shot and killed a Pakistani regional political party leader in the city of Quetta, police said, the latest violence in the southwestern province of Baluchistan.

Malik Naveed, 38, and his guard, Mohammad Zareef, 42, died en route to hospital after gunmen riding two motorcycles attacked his car shortly after he had left his home, Superintendent of Police Ashraf Jattak said.

One of Naveed's relatives, who was with him in the car, was wounded.

Naveed is one of the leaders of the opposition Baluchistan National Party, which advocates for more funds from the province's rich natural resources to go to the indigenous ethnic Baluch people.

No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.

Baluchistan province, of which Quetta is the capital, has long been home to an insurgency by the nationalist and separatist groups, who accuse the central government of discrimination in distribution of revenues from oil, gas and minerals.

Taliban and al Qaeda militants, as well as Islamic State-aligned Sunni sectarian groups also operate in the province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran.

Violence in Baluchistan has raised concerns about security for projects related to the $57 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor, a planned transport and energy link between western China to Pakistan's southern deep-water port of Gwadar.

HAMBURG "Welcome to Hell". That's the greeting for U.S. President Donald Trump and other world leaders from anti-capitalist protesters in Hamburg, who have vowed to disrupt the G20 summit in the German port city.

Among the 100,000 protesters expected in the city, some 8,000 are deemed by security forces to be ready to commit violence, posing a challenge for those tasked with securing the July 7-8 summit of leaders of the world's 20 biggest economies.

There has been no significant violence at several smaller demonstrations in the city this week, including a march on Wednesday by more than 7,000 beer-drinking mainly young revellers holding placards denouncing capitalism and G20 leaders.

But a fire overnight at a Porsche car dealer in the north of the city that damaged eight vehicles could be a foretaste of what's to come. Police said they were investigating whether it was an arson attack.

"There is no concrete evidence to link the incident to the G20 summit," a police spokesman told Reuters. "But we assume this is the case."

Locals are unhappy with Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to hold the summit in the centre of Germany's second-largest city as they fear property damage by violent protesters. Their daily routines are also being disrupted by security measures.

Up to 20,000 police officers will be on duty to watch over the main demonstration, dubbed "Welcome to Hell" by the alliance of anti-capitalist groups who organised it. Protesters have said they will try to block roads in the city.

Merkel took a big gamble in deciding to host the summit, where leaders will hold talks on difficult issues from trade and climate change to African development, in the city of her birth.

Should the protests go awry, her reputation could be damaged less than three months before an election in which she is seeking a fourth term.

To air the locals' disenchantment, Hamburg-based soft drinks maker Fritz Kola has launched a poster advertising campaign featuring a portrait of Trump snoozing. A caption reads: "Wake up, man! Fritz Kola. Lots of caffeine".

Protesters say the G20 has failed to solve many of the issues threatening world peace, including climate change, rising inequality and violent conflicts.

'EGOISTIC LEADER'

Tens of thousands will gather at the fish market in the borough of St Pauli - known for its red light district - at 1400 GMT, around the same time as Air Force One is due to land in Hamburg. They will then march north to the heavily secured summit venue.

"It's ridiculous that police say some of us are violent when starting tomorrow the leaders of the world's largest weapon exporting and importing nations will be arriving in our city," said Stefan Hubert, a 32-year-old graphic designer who came to the protest on Wednesday with three friends.

Holding a placard reading 'Make love great again!' he added: "This summit is a waste of money that could be better spent on deploying more boats to stop migrants fleeing war and hunger from drowning in the Mediterranean."

Turkish-German protester Fatima Cicek said she and her two sisters came to the demonstration on Wednesday to make the point that the G20 is undemocratic as it is a forum where a handful of leaders make decisions that could impact the whole world.

But her main issue is with Trump.

"He is the most disruptive and egotistic leader at the summit," the veiled 38-year-old social worker said.

There is an irony in the protesters' dislike of Trump. The U.S. president and anti-capitalist activists have something in common: distrust of globalisation.

Yet Trump is in Hamburg to push for trade rules that benefit America, including steel makers facing tough competition from China, while the protesters are here to demand more rights for the poor regardless of where they live.

"Trump is here to promote his own interests and those of the richest people in America," said Cicek. "We are demanding more rights for the millions of people in Africa who have no roof over their heads."

On the floor of Gertjan Vlieghe’s wood-panelled Bank of England office sits a small doorstop in the shape of a hedgehog – an animal not renowned for its speed. And its patient owner is certainly in no hurry to put up interest rates.

Mr Vlieghe, 46, who joined the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee as an external member in 2015 has established himself as the most dovish member of the rate-setting committee.

Even before the Brexit referendum Mr Vlieghe was publicly fretting about the fragility of the UK economy and even floated the possibility that interests rates might need to pushed by the Bank into negative territory.

And so when the Leave side unexpectedly prevailed last June, prompting widespread fears of an imminent recession, Mr Vlieghe voted for an immediate cut in rates to 0.25 per cent. The eight other members of the Monetary Policy Committee wanted to hold their fire until they saw more data, although they joined him the next month in sending rates down to a new record low.

But now many of Mr Vlieghe’s colleagues are breaking the other way. In June, three external MPC members voted to increase rates back to 0.5 per cent, reversing last August’s cut, and creating the biggest split on the committee since 2011.

And since then, significantly, Andy Haldane, the Bank’s chief economist, has signalled that he is ready to join the hikers. If the arch-dove Mr Vlieghe were also to switch sides many financial traders would probably assume an August rate rise from Threadneedle Street was nailed on.

But not so fast. This dove is not for turning – at least not yet.

“I haven’t really changed my mind,” he says. “This is an environment where a premature hike would be a bigger mistake than one that turns out to be slightly late because of the asymmetry around risk.”

That risk, in Mr Vlieghe’s view, relates to the fact that rates are currently so close to zero. If the Bank raises rates and then has to reverse course because the economy falters it has much less room to cut.

“Our ability as a central bank to stimulate spending is...smaller than our ability to restrain spending,” as he put it in an unusually wide-ranging speech analysing the major structural economic forces acting on the UK economy in 2016.

Though he admits that inflation, which hit 2.9 per cent in May, is “uncomfortably high” he sees that primarily as the natural pass-through of the slump in the pound in the wake of the Brexit vote.

And he’s more concerned about the underlying weakness of the economy. Though the UK did not go into recession last summer, many see Brexit-related chickens coming home to roost now in the form of dwindling consumer confidence.

“I think the consumption slowdown is here, it’s not over,” says Mr Vlieghe, adding that he does not see investment and exports taking over the baton and driving growth.

“Of course if the data turns out stronger I do agree that a higher rates is warranted but my central forecast is that’s not going to happen in the near term.”

So would he be happy to vote in a minority to keep rates on hold, while the rest of his colleagues wanted to hike? Mr Vlieghe is unperturbed by the thought. “I will do whatever my reading of the data tells me is the right thing,” he says, matter-of-factly.

One gets the impression that the intellectually self-assured Mr Vlieghe, who traded in a partnership at the hedge fund Brevan Howard to join the MPC, would rather relish the prospect of arguing his corner against the odds.

“I spent ten years trying to forecast what central banks, including the Bank of England, were going to do next,” he says. “Having the opportunity to actually make the decision, rather than forecast it, was for me both fascinating and an honour and a privilege. The closest thing you can compare it to is if you sit in the football commentator’s box and someone says ‘do you want to go down on the pitch for a while?’”.

Mr Vlieghe’s office neighbour at the Bank, until this month, was fellow external MPC member Kristin Forbes. She has now left the Bank and in her final speech she suggested modern central bankers’ high profiles were making them too reticent to “take away the punch bowl” by raising rates.

“I completely disagree with that,” says Mr Vlieghe. “All of the decisions that have been made over the last few years have related very clearly to the data. We have been in an environment where, despite record low interest rates, growth has been subdued, inflation pressures have been weak everywhere, wage pressure is still very weak – that tells you those very low interest rates were entirely appropriate. If they hadn’t been we would have seen a lot of overheating…which we just don’t see."

“That period of low rates had nothing to do with reputation or political pressure or anything like that.”

For Mr Vlieghe, who was born in Belgium but now has dual UK citizenship, Brexit has personal repercussions. But he’s tight-lipped about how he feels personally about the vote, insisting his only focus as an MPC member is considering how it will impact the economy.

But how does the committee go about forecasting that given the immense political uncertainty?

“It’s very difficult to get your head around because it doesn’t matter what we think about Brexit, it matters what everyone else thinks, and the extent to which it influences their demand today,” he explains.

If firms start worrying about a cliff-edge Brexit in two years, he says, there could yet be a big damaging pullback of investment. On the other hand, if the UK seems to be heading towards a “lengthy transition deal” after 2019, effectively remaining in the single market and the customs union, things could perk up.

“That would be a very positive thing for business and investment and would therefore influence our interest rate policy,” he says.

Even hedgehogs can move rather rapidly when they want to.

More than £47 million was paid in supposedly tax-free loans to players, managers and directors at Rangers through EBTs between 2001 and 2010 PA

The tax authorities have won a long battle with Rangers after the dismissal of an appeal by the UK’s highest court.

The ruling in the so-called Big Tax case by the Supreme Court in London is likely to give HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) the chance to pursue more football clubs, businesses and individuals for avoiding tax when using employee benefit trusts (EBTs).

More than £47 million was paid in supposedly tax-free loans to players, managers and directors at Rangers through EBTs between 2001 and 2010 — when the club was dominating Scottish football and owned by Sir David Murray. The ruling means HMRC can pursue some of the team’s former players and staff for a tax refund that could amount to millions of pounds.

The Taj Mahal of Debt : TRUMP Surviving at the Top by Donald J. Trump with Charles Leerhsen (Random House: $21.95; 236 pp., illustrated ; 0-394-57597-0)

Have you seen the cover? There's the celestial Trump, floating in the clouds like a Tiepolo angel and flipping an apple into the air. The apple is supposed to represent New York, so you get the idea that Trump has New York in the palm of his hand, and the expression on his face says: "I've made it, you schmucks, and too bad about you."

The title alone, "Surviving at the Top," is so perversely marvelous that there ought to be a contest to invent others that could equal it. Here are a few candidates: Marie Antoinette's "Keeping My Head," Achilles' "Recovering From a Hamstring Injury," Gen. Custer's "Outfoxing the Enemy" and Jean Claude Duvalier's "President for Life."

But, alas, he did write another book, "Trump: Surviving at the Top," which is another kind of great deal, ranking right up there with "Vanna Speaks." It came out in New York the very week that Trump's lenders in New Jersey were working overtime to stave off the imminent bankruptcy of the great "survivor of success" himself, now saddled with the Taj Majal of Debt.

Why couldn't Donald Trump quit while he was ahead? He already owned Trump's Castle, Trump Tower, Trump Plaza and Trump Parc, and all of them "great deals," so what did he need with the disastrous Taj Mahal of Debt? Why build another casino?

Compare this celestial Trump on the cover of the new book to the one on the cover of the first book--"Trump: The Art of the Deal"--where the man appears to be sitting in a window, slightly elevated but within sight of the ground--and you realize how far Trump has risen in his own estimation, even in the short space of three years.

Compare the text of the new book to that of the old (there's a different ghostwriter this time) and you'll notice an obvious increase in the employment of flattering adjectives, such as: "dazzling trophy" (Trump's yacht), "fabulous structure" (his Plaza hotel), "marvelous facility" (a Trump casino), "jewel-encrusted casino" (another Trump plaything), "the magnificent Taj Mahal" (the Trump Taj Mahal), the "best airline of its kind" (the Trump shuttle), "adoring crowds," "huge talent" and "celebrity-studded events."

Under the circumstances, the Trump books have a definite new appeal in the humor category, which is how I would market them if I were Random House or Warner, right alongside Dave Barry. Throughout, there are funny quotes, such as: "Bankers now come to me to ask if I might be interested in borrowing their money. They know a safe bet"; or "I'm going to be building when everybody else has gone bust"; or Trump's advice to Mike Tyson: "Stay out of investments in real- estate deals and tax shelters."

Another rewarding way to read Trump is to study both volumes simultaneously. This, I found, gives many clues as to what has happened to Trump to drive him toward insolvency.

In Trump's initial memoir from three years ago, he was nearly all business: haggling, niggling, finding the good deals that would make him rich. In the photo section of the first book, there are two pages of Trump appearing with various "hot people," such as Herschel Walker and the Reagans, but seven pages of Trump's marvelous buildings. This more or less indicates where Trump's priorities lay: seven-to-two, assets over celebrities.

In "Surviving at the Top," photos of Trump buildings have been reduced to three pages, while there are 10 pages of him standing with Hulk Hogan, the Muppets, Michael Jackson, Don Johnson, George Bush, Sugar Ray Leonard, Benazir Bhutto, Mike Wallace and Mike Tyson, whom Trump describes as "more than just a great boxer . . . one of the most talked-about people in the world. "

Judging by the photo ratio, you begin to suspect that keeping up with investments has not been as interesting to Trump as keeping up with talked-about people, which seems to have become the man's real full-time job.

Should Trump personally welcome Kitty Dukakis to the Plaza Hotel? Should he retaliate against a major designer, whom he once helped with a substance-abuse problem and who has snubbed Trump's latest fashion show? Should he lend his helicopter to the Duchess of York? Should he refuse to shake Mick Jagger's hand after Jagger has hogged a press conference at one of Trump's casinos? Should he let Time magazine put him on the cover? Should he tolerate Frank Sinatra's boorish behavior at a nightclub?

Wimbledon has been interrupted by pigeons, a squirrel and on one occasion a swarm of bees. Yesterday it was hit by its first invasion of flying ants.

A player battling through the second round reported that one of the insects flew up his nose and Johanna Konta, Britain’s best hope for the women’s singles title, said she had swallowed some.

Sam Querrey of the US, who won his match against Thomas Fabbiano of Italy on court 18, said he had considered asking the umpire to stop the match.

“I have never seen that before,” he said. “They seemed to kind of go away after a while but if it [had] got much worse I was wanting to stop because they’re hitting you in the face.

Apple is working on "the mother of all AI projects" by "focusing on autonomous systems" designed for the automotive industry, says the tech giant's chief executive Tim Cook.

In an exclusive interview with Bloomberg, Cook said that Apple was working on "probably one of the most difficult AI projects". He added that autonomous systems were "a core technology that we view as very important."

While these systems are expected to be used on autonomous cars manufactured by existing car companies, Cook doesn't rule out the possibility of an electric Apple car in the future.

"It's a marvellous experience not to stop at the filling station or the gas station", he says, adding that "there is a major disruption looming" in the motoring industry.

Automotive industry expert David Bailey told The Guardian that Apple "can offer a number of things such as the software systems that enable the tech to function".

He adds that the company also has the ability to make driverless technology "extremely friendly for a passenger in a way that other tech companies haven't been able to do."

Rumours of an Apple car emerged in September 2015, says Wired, when it was revealed the Cupertino-based tech giant was developing a driverless vehicle under the name of "Project Titan".

These rumours were bolstered the following year. The website says that Apple "sent a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in Washington that alluded to its plans for a vehicle".

The firm also invested $1bn (£785m) in the Chinese ride hailing company Didi Chuxing last year, The Independent reports, but there has been no word yet on how Apple will apply the company's technology to its driverless project.

BEIRUT A suicide bomber in Syria's Hama killed two people and injured nine others on Thursday, state media said, in the second such attack in a government-held city this week.

State television said the attacker set off an explosive belt at a bus station in the southwest of the city.

The governor of Hama said the explosion killed two women, according to another state-run channel, Ikhbariya. It had quoted him earlier as saying three people had died.

On Sunday, a bomb killed 20 people and wounded dozens more in Damascus.

Since the start of the year, a string of blasts have hit the cities of Damascus and Homs, which are under the control of President Bashar al-Assad's government fighting rebel groups in the country's six-year war.

HONG KONG A second Philippine senator has called for an investigation into police conduct after a Reuters report revealed anti-drug squads were sending the bodies of slain suspects to hospital to destroy crime scenes and cover up executions.

A resolution, filed by opposition senator Leila de Lima on Thursday, is the second such request in less than a week and puts the Senate under increasing pressure to act.

The chairman of the Senate Committee on Public Order and Dangerous Drugs, former police chief Panfilo Lacson, told Reuters on Monday he would launch an investigation and invite witnesses named in the article to testify under oath. The Senate reconvenes at the end of July.

De Lima's chief of staff, Fhillip Sawali, said the two separate calls for a probe showed the gravity of the matter.

"It sends a clear message that this is something that is serious, that is worthy of the conduct of a Senate investigation," Sawali told Reuters.

President Rodrigo Duterte's office has yet to comment on the Senate moves.

Thousands have died since Duterte came to power a year ago and declared war on what he called the drugs menace.

The Reuters report, published on June 29, drew on data from two of Metro Manila's five police districts for the first eight months of the drug war along with interviews with witnesses, family members, doctors and police.

It detailed how the Philippine National Police had sent hundreds of dead drug suspects to hospital after anti-drug operations. It showed that the proportion of drug suspects sent to hospital only to be declared dead on arrival rose in step with international and domestic criticism of the drug war.

One police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity explained that the practice of sending drug war corpses to hospital was a tactic to avoid crime scene investigations and media attention.

Interviewed for the report, Metro Manila Police Chief Oscar Albayalde promised to investigate its findings. National Police Chief Ronald dela Rosa, who declined to be interviewed for the article, said later that the police lack the medical training to determine if a suspect is dead or alive.

Jeremy Corbyn is willing to tackle the organisers of Glastonbury festival over their use of zero hour contracts, his spokesman said yesterday.

The Labour leader addressed thousands at the event in Somerset last month and told the crowd that Britons should not have to “accept low wages and insecurity as just part of life”.

Michael Eavis, the organiser of the festival, has faced criticism over reports that hundreds of workers from across Europe were hired as litter pickers but laid off after two days because there was less mess than expected.

Asked whether Mr Corbyn could boycott the festival, which is next scheduled for 2019 to give the land at Worthy Farm a year to recover, the spokesman said: “Jeremy and the Labour party have…

Before Naughty Dog created the wise-cracking adventurer Nathan Drake and threw him into numerous set pieces in the acclaimed Uncharted series, the developer produced another PlayStation star called Crash Bandicoot.

It was 1994 and Jason Rubin and Andy Gavin had decided to work on a 3D action-platform game in which the main character would run into the screen, tackle obstacles and collect things. Two years later, and with the developer having created its own programming language and compression software in a bid to get the game running fluidly on the PSOne, the game was ready. It sold six million copies and Crash became the Sony console's unofficial mascot.

More than 20 years later, Crash is back, stomping the same old ground as he did all that time ago when he sought to stop Brio and Cortex from taking over the world while attempting to rescue his girlfriend, Tawna. In fact, put that original game next to this refashioned, new version and you'd be hard-pressed to see much difference.

Aside, that is, from the modern animation, hugely enhanced graphics, up to 1440p rendering, cool motion blurring, superb sounds and a rethink of how the game plays for a more demanding gamer on a platform that allows for greater technical prowess. For this is Crash Bandicoot for the PS4 and it has never looked or felt better.

You can't help but play this game with a smile on your face. Indeed, to pull off something as unique and yet as familiar as this is a masterstroke, with the developer straddling the fine line between a remake of a classic and straightforward remaster. We actually got a glimpse of the old Crash in the final installment of Drake's Uncharted adventures but while that allowed us to reacquaint ourselves with the basics, the pangs of nostalgia for those who remember this the first time round come flooding back as you remember how cool, exciting and progressive gaming in the 1990s proved to be.

That said, Crash does show its age. As you progress at speed, spinning to dispatch nasties, bouncing on boxes to collect fruit, leaping over gaps and avoiding constantly moving obstacles, you do realise how far we've come from such rudimentary mechanics. It's about as arcade as you're going to get, not that such a thing is a harsh criticism, but if you're after something to tax your brain, then it's not going to satisfy quite as well as the more fluid and expansive titles of today.

But that is missing the point. The three Crash Bandicoot games here – hence the trilogy – really do dazzle. You'll admire the cartoon-like scenery and, if you're that way inclined, may even cheer the artists for essentially ripping up the originals and putting in a ton of effort to make the fires glow more intensely and the blades of 3D grass stand starkly. It's quite a feat to take low-resolution graphics and work on them to such a degree that they are not only enhanced but still bear a striking resemblance to the original. Sometimes you think of retro games with rose-tinted glasses and are shocked the reality doesn't match the memory. This turns such a thing on its head.

One thing you'd remember if you played the original, though, is that it is a damn difficult game (more so when it comes to the racing sections that, unfortunately, still fare badly). Come a cropper and you can end up going way back to a distant checkpoint to start over. What's more, with waves of enemies, huge drops and the need for some exquisite timing, finishing the debut really can feel like a major accomplishment. No wonder Naughty Dog had made the other two games easier and that the latest developer Vicarious Visions has decided to put a few helping hands into the new versions. You can get power-ups and checkpoints that better suit your ability and for newbies, certainly, it's all the better for it.

It helps you fall in love with the game given you're not gnashing your teeth to as great a degree as you once would have. The upshot is that it'll encourage you to plunge into the new options, whether it's playing as Crash's sister, Coco, or competing in the time trial modes that allow you to compete with friends online. One thing's for sure, though, you will want to play. And replay. And try some more. That, ultimately, is the success both of this recreation and the original. It seems you really can't keep a good marsupial down.

Prime Minister's Questions returns for the second week since Parliament resumed after the general election.

Clashes between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are likely to focus on the issue of public sector pay, with ministers under mounting pressure to ease austerity and scrap the 1% cap on public sector pay increases.

A number of senior Tory ministers, including Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, have called for the cap to be lifted, but Chancellor Philip Hammond is standing firm - for now at least.

Labour's Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, has been granted an urgent question in the Commons on the issue, but that is unlikely to stop Jeremy Corbyn quizzing the Ms May about it too.

MPs are likely to grill the Prime Minister on the ongoing response to the Grenfell Tower disaster, with many of the victims still to be rehoused and Kensington and Chelsea council having been widely condemned for its actions in the days after the blaze.

Today's main politics stories are:

Austerity pay cap declared 'dead in the water after firefighters offer'

David Cameron says people who opposed austerity are 'selfish'

Scotland to end public sector pay cap next year

DUP says no power-sharing deal reached in Northern Ireland

Top BBC journalist snubs Theresa May's attempt to recruit him

Government taskforce to take control of parts of Kensington council

In 2015, every Conservative politician and newspaper screamed “Labour is planning an evil alliance to form a government, by talking to the SCOTTISH NATIONALIST PARTY!!” This would mean Alex Salmond could billet their pandas in our kitchens and they’ll drain their lochs onto the M1 so you can only get to Luton by submarine, then we’ll be forced to hand over our sunlight so Dundee gets the same amount in winter as Bournemouth.

Now we realise the reason they were so upset is because what you’re supposed to do if you can’t form a government is make an agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party.

Unlike the SNP, who emit extremist ideas such as scrapping tuition fees and installing a new one-way system in Falkirk, the DUP offer moderate policies, such as strolls through built-up areas, joyfully singing about the day in 1682 when all local Catholics were fed to a tiger.

They’ve embraced inclusiveness in recent times, reaching out to a diverse group of white Presbyterian fundamentalists. And they’ve even made efforts to adopt some Catholic values, such as insisting abortion is a sin for which the Lord will exact mighty vengeance, raining down with unimaginable fury upon the heathen filthy dirty vermin who have anything to do with it. They don’t even allow you forgiveness for confessing it, which shows how much effort they’ve made, by managing to be even more crackpot about it than the Vatican.

They’re associated with a few quirky attitudes that some Catholics still object to, such as the statement often made by their founder, Ian Paisley, that the Pope is the anti-Christ. But to be fair he only ever said this quietly.

In any case, supporters of the Conservatives insist the influence of the DUP will be minimal. One way they’ve already changed things is Theresa May often refers now to the “Conservative and Unionist Party”, which she rarely did before.

By next week she’ll be saying “our team in the Brexit negotiations is strong and stable, especially ya wee man David Davis so he is. And my message to Jeremy Corbyn is ‘will ye catch yerself on’.”

Then the Queen will begin her speech to open the new parliament, “My government will ensure there is no surrender, no surrender, no surrender to the IRA”, and announce a bill to encourage the arts, by commissioning a mural called “men in balaclavas” to cover the outside of St Paul’s Cathedral.

Theresa May responds to John Major criticism over DUP deal

One impressive side to the DUP is they don’t restrict themselves to Northern Irish matters, they have a wide range of interests. So Edwin Poots, once their environment minister in the Stormont parliament, objected to the sign at Giant’s Causeway, as it explained the geological reasons for the rock formation over a period of millions of years. This was a ridiculous and misleading sign, he said, as the earth was only six thousand years old, as you could tell from the Bible.

So the Queen’s Speech might include a bill to remove the dinosaur skeletons from the Natural History Museum, as they didn’t exist anyway, and be replaced by a fascinating display of flutes.

Even the procession before the speech will be more colourful than normal, as the equerries abandon their usual tunics and wear orange sashes, and take a detour through an Irish pub for a song about the day when County Fermanagh was boiled in molten lead by the Apprentice Boys of Carrickfergus.

Then instead of banging on the door of the Commons with his stick, Black Rod will march to Westminster Cathedral and use it to put the windows in.

The DUP have been accused of being in alliance with paramilitaries, but this seems a little unfair. For example in 1986, their leader Peter Robinson is reported to have supported a group called Ulster Resistance, declaring: “The Resistance has indicated that drilling and training has already started.” The DUP is reported to have severed its ties, when the group was linked to the arms trade, having procured guns from apartheid South Africa.

The Queen’s Speech has been delayed two days while the agreement is reached, but this seems reasonable, as I’m sure the Tories and their newspapers would be just as understanding if the Labour Party ever delayed a Queen’s Speech, so it could organise an agreement with Sinn Fein.

Even so, the new government is a delight, because usually they take three years to start fraying, over predictable issues such as Europe. But this one starts in a state of utter confusion and can collapse in a hundred different ways, possibly in an argument between Liam Fox and Kenneth Clarke about how many raisins to put in a scone.

The Conservatives have no idea how they landed in this mess and even less idea what to do about it, and that guarantees all kinds of entertainment.

Strangely, I was on the radio with Iain Duncan Smith on Sunday, and he delivered a speech on the necessity for unity in the Conservative Party. Then the presenter mentioned that Nicky Morgan had called for a leadership election, and Smith said: “Well she would, that’s typical of her.” Then an interview with Michael Heseltine was played, and he muttered “What a fool, why does anyone bother interviewing him, the man’s a fool” all the way through.

So it’s a novel form of unity they’re after, in which every one of them agrees to call all the others a steaming t**t who ruined everything. Give it three months and the DUP will announce: “We can’t stay in coalition with the Conservatives, this lot are an irrational chaotic bunch of extremists.”

We all have stressful periods in our lives - whether that’s through work, family or relationships.

And when you’re under a lot of pressure, it can be hard to stay calm and react sensibly.

One person who knows a thing or two about doing so, however, is Ben Murphy, former team leader of the Red Arrows and competitor in the Red Bull Air Race, which took place in Budapest last weekend.

We flew out to Budapest to meet Murphy, take a spin in his plane and learn his secrets for keeping cool under pressure.

Ben Murphy

After 16 years in the RAF, 41-year-old Murphy decided to move into aerobatic flights for a new challenge.

High speeds, obstacles and 10G forces mean flying the plane can be incredibly dangerous, and Murphy says the Red Bull Air Race is his “ultimate flying challenge.”

But when the risks are so great and the pressure to perform so high, how does he stay calm? Well, he just sits on his hands. Metaphorically at least.

“The best piece of advice that we got through training is that if something goes wrong, take a deep breath and don’t respond instantly,” Murphy explained to The Independent.

“We used to call it sitting on your hands. Avoid the temptation to start pulling levers. Take a couple of seconds and absorb all the information you have coming to you.

“That one or two seconds gives your brain the time to process what’s going on and you’re about 90 per cent more likely to take the right course of action and make the right decisions after that than if you just dive straight in and do it instinctively.”

The Red Bull Air Race in Budapest last weekend

And it’s advice that anyone can apply in their lives.

With just a few minutes to practise on the course before each race, there’s a lot of pressure on Murphy. And things have gone wrong before.

“Everybody at this level has had a situation where they’ve been properly tested,” he explains. “I had it in a harrier where we had what’s known as a bird strike - we flew through a lot of birds, they hit the aeroplane, and when you’re doing 480mph a seagull does a lot of damage.

“The birds destroyed the glass canopy over the top of us, they went down the engine and damaged the wings. The plane essentially turned into a 480mph cabriolet! It was windy and noisy but we just went through the drills, managed the damaged aircraft and brought the plane down.

“It was only when we thought about it afterwards that we realised what had actually just happened and that we’d done something really quite complicated.”

And even if nothing goes wrong, taking part in an aerobatic flight is an experience that’ll give anyone a rush, as I found out when I took a flight in Murphy's plane.

What it's like to fly in a stunt plane for the Red Bull Air Race

So whilst not everyone manages to control their foul mouth in extreme situations, Murphy says he’s always been calm: “I like to think I’ve always been a very calm person. It’s a prerequisite for something like this and certainly in my military flying days - performing under pressure is exactly what they’re looking for.”

Time to practise sitting on my hands (and keeping my mouth shut).

John Lewis’ long-standing “Never knowingly undersold” promise has come under fire after an investigation showed the retailer was selling certain products at a higher price than available elsewhere.

The slogan has been a cornerstone of the department store’s marketing campaign since 1925 and guarantees that it will refund British shoppers the difference if they can find the same product for less elsewhere.

On its website John Lewis says: “Our dedicated price-monitoring team proactively check the prices of branded products at our high street competitors every day, including online and during sales. If we find that they are selling the same individual product, sold with the same service conditions, at a lower price, we’ll meet that price in our shops and at johnlewis.com. So we don’t expect you to find a lower price elsewhere. But if you do, you can easily make a price match request.”

Now, an investigation by consumer website MoneySavingExpert.com has shown that the retailer did not cut the advertised prices of 15 out of 16 products even after it was informed that those products were being sold more cheaply by other retailers, including Tesco and Toys R Us.

To test the policy, MoneySavingExpert.com purchased a range of different products - all of which were sold for lower prices elsewhere - over two consecutive days in March, from John Lewis stores and its website.

Following buying the goods, money experts monitored the price of 16 items the retailer had agreed to issue price match refunds for - therefore accepting its price had been undercut.

But after seven days John Lewis had only dropped the price of one of the items.

Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, said the research shows John Lewis is not always the “champion of price” it wants customers to think it is.

“The failure was not limited to a few items, which could have been put down to just having a bad day - it was well over 90 per cent of them. Some of these are due to its processes simply not working, others due to its 'eight mile' policy - that effectively says it'll give individuals who ask a refund, but keep the price higher, and only reduce it for others who ask,” Mr Lewis said.

“If John Lewis wants to tout its 'Never Knowingly Undersold' catchphrase, it should put up or shut up, or it risks losing its great reputation,” he added.

We will look at the detail of their report to see where we can make improvements for our customers in either our processes or communications on the website.

"John Lewis is the only department store with a comprehensive price promise. Never Knowingly Undersold means that we proactively check the prices of tens of thousands of products everyday so our customers can be confident of getting the best possible price on the high street. If a customer has found an identical product, sold with the same conditions, we would match the price. We have a dedicated price-monitoring team who proactively check the prices of tens of thousands of branded products at our high street competitors every day, including products on their websites."

Alex Hales hit the highest score ever recorded in a county final at Lord's as Nottinghamshire beat Surrey by four wickets to win the Royal London One-Day Cup.

Neither Hales nor Surrey's Mark Stoneman were included in England's Test squad announced on Saturday, but each sent a timely message to Joe Root and the selectors as Hales smashed a match-winning 187 not out after Stoneman had posted 144, also unbeaten.

The pair now boast two of the top three knocks ever seen in a county final at Lord's, with Hales smashing Geoffrey Boycott's 1965 record of 146 while Stoneman finished just two short.

Both could have been removed early after Hales was dropped by Ollie Pope on nine and Stoneman by Steven Mullaney on 32 but it was the former's awesome display, eclipsing his previous career-best of 171 for England last year, that inspired Nottinghamshire to reach their 298-target.

Hales' effort will go down as one of the great one-day innings, coming in 167 balls and including 20 fours and four sixes.

It means Surrey have now lost three successive finals in this competition after defeats to Gloucestershire in 2015 and Warwickshire last year, while retiring Nottinghamshire captain Chris Read, who made a crucial 58, was given the perfect send-off in what is likely to be his final outing at Lord's.

Stuart Broad was passed fit for the Outlaws after a recent heel problem and Luke Fletcher replaced the injured Jake Ball. Surrey's Scott Borthwick was preferred to Rory Burns.

Surrey skipper Gareth Batty won the toss and chose to bat first but his side's strong start was as much due to some dismal Nottinghamshire fielding as any skill at the crease.

A half-full crowd had barely taken their seats when, from Fletcher's first ball of the day, Riki Wessels failed to collect a Jason Roy (23) edge at first slip and then Mullaney put one down at cover, this time after Stoneman had lifted generously into the air.

Stoneman was again spared when Read dropped an albeit more difficult chance behind but Nottinghamshire sparked a revival with four wickets in eight overs.

Roy rode his luck at the beginning of his innings (Getty)



Kumar Sangakkara (30), Borthwick (14), Ben Foakes (one) and Pope (four) were the guilty parties as Surrey tumbled from 141 for one to 180 for five but Stoneman remained undeterred as an edge behind confirmed his century.

Surrey, at 255 for seven, were looking for a big finish but Gareth Batty (11) and Jade Dernbach (one) both departed cheaply to leave the Outlaws needing a respectable 298 to win.

Just as Surrey started with an early drop so did Nottinghamshire, as Hales thrashed a drive straight at Pope in the covers but the ball popped out of the 19-year-old's fingers.

Lumb on four was beaten lbw by Sam Curran (three for 60) but Hales took full advantage of his reprieve by blasting a quick 50 off 35 balls.

Hales helped Notts win their first trophy since 2013 (Getty)



Ravi Rampaul saw off the dangerous pair of Wessels and Patel for six and seven respectively before Brendan Taylor, also on seven, feathered Dernbach through to the hands of Foakes.

But Hales was on a one-man mission, combining technical precision with brazen power-hitting, and he secured his century in just 83 balls with Nottinghamshire 134 for four.

It could have proven irrelevant had Read not finally provided a partner for Hales, who secured 200 for his side in the 32nd over and then 150 for himself, a flick to fine leg ensuring he cruised past Boycott's 52-year long record.

Read's half-century drew one of the day's biggest cheers from the travelling support but when he picked out Sam Curran in the deep, all that was left was for Hales and James Pattinson to seal victory with two overs to spare.

A video blogger has apparently live-streamed herself being poisoned - by eating a plant which she mistakenly thought was aloe vera.

The 26-year-old - known online as Zhang - appeared on an internet live-stream holding two large dark-green leaves, which look similar to those of the aloe vera plant.

During the broadcast – called Aloe Vera Feast – she is seen taking a large bite out of one of the leaves, but it quickly becomes clear that something is wrong as she remarks upon the surprising bitterness of the plant.





According to Shanghaiist, she was actually eating Agave Americana, a poisonous plant which contains known irritants.

She reportedly broke out into "rashes and blisters", and had her stomach pumped to remove traces of the plant. While it's hard to confirm that local reports about the veracity of the video, it does highlight the potential dangers of laymen experimenting with more exotic plants.





The agave plant's sap contains calcium oxalate crystals, acrid oils, saponins, and other compounds which irritate the human body. A page on the US Food and Drug administration’s website lists scores of studies into the plant’s harmful effects.

Cornell University’s college of agricultural and life sciences says the plant has several toxic compounds, and calls the calcium oxalate crystals "incredibly irritating".

Aloe vera can be eaten, and is often juiced or pulped ( Getty Images)

Actual aloe vera leaves are harmless – other than producing a laxative effect in larger doses – and food and fitness bloggers regularly whizz up the plant's leaves in smoothies, or add it to salads.

The outer skin of the plant can be eaten but it's often tough and stringy, so generally only the clear inner part of the stalk is eaten.

Agave is best-known as the plant from which pulp is turned into tequila (Getty Images/iStockphoto)



Some avoid the hassle of separating the stalks by simply juicing the plant, or gently poaching it to soften it up.

The agave plant does have culinary uses, and is best known for mescal and tequila, which is made from the fermented pulp. However, the exotic desert plant needs careful preparation to avoid any significant side-effects.

The lure of a good floating hotel never fades. With Edinburgh planning a boat hotel, set to open next year, here are some of the best watery beds to be found in big cities.

The Queen Mary: Los Angeles

This transatlantic vintage vessel has been in service since 1930, and, now moored in Long Beach harbour, has barely changed since its glory days. Original taps and tinted pink mirrors serve as relics of its heyday, and walking around the deck is a trip back in time. The grandiose liner is also an exhibition space, with a long-running exhibition of Princess Diana’s clothes. Doubles from $127 (£104)

A different take on Paris (Facebook)

OFF Paris Seine: Paris

Huge, luxury boats may not be the first thing that springs to mind when you think Paris, but this catamaran-style hotel has been making waves since its June opening. There’s a bar overlooking the Seine, and a lavish patio with a plunge pool opens in the summer. Doubles from €116

London’s four-star Sunborn, inhabiting a superyacht in the heart of the Docklands area, features therapy rooms, two luxury restaurants, yacht suites and a typically British Afternoon Tea option for its guests. Rooms are retro-lux. Doubles from £140

Eat on the water at Salt & Sill (Facebook)

A floating hotel built on two pontoons, Salt & Sill’s granite-floored and wood-furnished rooms are in the main building but the Salt & Sill’s pièce de résistance is its bath and sauna boat, a lightweight fibreglass catamaran moored alongside the hotel. Guests can lounge on the sundeck,in the hot tub, or take a quick dip in the North Sea. Doubles from 2,290 SEK (£209)

Zambezi Queen: Botswana

A cross between a hotel and a river cruise, the Zambezi Queen takes guests on a two-night ride down the Chobe River in Botswana, drifting along just 16 miles on its journey, with meals made from locally sourced ingredients. Guests can enjoy excursions and activities including fishing, birding and game viewing. Doubles from $495 (£407)

Tony Blair was not "straight with the nation" about his reasons for going to war in Iraq, Sir John Chilcot says. In his first interview since publishing his report on the conflict last year, the inquiry chief said the evidence given was "emotionally truthful", but relied on beliefs rather than facts. Blair's spokesman said "all these issues" had been dealt with.

Narcissists tend to get the furthest in life. That's the most disheartening fact that writer Eric Barker learned after spending almost a decade trying to uncover what makes some people glittering examples of success and others, well, not so much.

“Narcissists do better in job interviews, are more attractive on first dates, and are more likely to be promoted to leadership positions,” Barker, who has recently released the book Barking up the Wrong Tree off the back of his blog of the same name, tells The Independent. “It's distressing to realise that, at least in the short term, a lot of bad behaviour can pay dividends.”

After poring over studies into the, albeit subjective, notions of happiness and success since the summer of 2009 Barker has made a heap of uncomfortable discoveries. In that time he has unpicked common questions including whether nice guys really do finish last, if sucking up to your boss ever works and, er, what we can learn from serial killers when it comes to excelling in our careers.

Disconcerting for both parents, children and adults in denial, Barker has found that being at the top of the class quickly becomes unimportant in the ‘real world’, depending on a person’s life goals. And if becoming an world-innovating billionaire sounds appealing, listen up.

Writer Eric Barker has found that narcissists do best in life in the short term (Michael Goode )

Barker cites a 1995 study conducted at Boston College in the US which documented the lives of 81 valedictorians for 14 years after they graduated. Sure, 90 per cent of them went on to have professional jobs, and 40 per cent climbed to the highest possible role in their respective fields. But zero had achieved anything truly world-shattering.

On the contrary, separate research into 700 millionaires found that their average GPA was 2.9 and their winning quality wasn’t sticking to the beaten track or obediently learning how to pass exams, but breaking the rules. Often, that didn’t go hand in hand with academic prowess.

Apple CEO Steve JObs had a lower than average GPA of 2.9 but has changed how we live (Getty)

Another study at the Stanford Graduate School of Business showed that managing how your boss sees you is more important than working hard when it comes to climbing the career ladder. And separate research at the University of California Berkeley into ass-kissing found that it never backfires, even when a manager knows that it's totally insincere.

And if going against the grain to achieve wild success while stepping on more than a few toes sounds familiarly like the behaviour of the current president of the US, Donald Trump, Barker explains that he neatly fits into research at Harvard which showed that leaders fall into two categories: filtered and unfiltered.

"Filtered leaders are thoroughly vetted by the system and tend to maintain the status quo. Unfiltered leaders don't go through the standard checks and balances; like entrepreneurs or politicians who come to power through an unlikely series of events. Trump is the most 'unfiltered' president America has ever seen. Unfiltered leaders don't play by the standard rules, in fact, they may not even be familiar with the standard rules. Their tenures are marked by big changes, often negative, sometimes positive. Trump has probably shown us that a lot of Americans were seeking change — and they're likely to get it. For better or for worse."

So far so depressing. But Barker is adamant that his research isn't intended to turn us all into heartless psychopaths, nor does it spell doom for those who aren't naturally narcissistic or sycophantic. Quite the opposite. Luckily he also found that, in the end, being a jerk doesn't pay off as the workplace becomes bloated with liars and schemers, creating an unpleasant environment that is hard to sustain in many cases. In addition, while our interactions with others are certainly important they aren't the be all and end all, but rather part of a wider picture. Barker found that what was even more important than worrying about what is going on around you when chasing success is recognising and cultivating specific skills.

“I'm naturally an introvert,” he says, “but I knew for the book I'd need to reach out to people and get help. In chapter four, when I explore the old maxim of “It's not what you know, it's who you know” I detail some of the most effective networking techniques according to the academic research. I leveraged those to connect with some of the people whose stories I told. Without the help of those tips, I would have missed out on some of the most inspiring and insightful parts of the book."

Recognising that he is an introvert rather than attempting to mask it, he adds, is one of the most important lessons he has learned since and one of the biggest mistakes that most people make when they try to improve their lives.

"Most people don't really take the time to objectively 'know thyself'. They aren't clear on their personal strengths and weaknesses," stresses Barker. "Without that information, it's hard to align yourself with a good environment where you'll thrive, with the right people who can help you compensate for your shortcomings, and difficult to know what skills you need to double down on and which ones you might want to work on or ignore."

"A lot of the maxims we've been taught about success are myths or half-truths, but there is a lot of information about getting ahead that is valuable, if not essential," he adds. "Success is possible for everyone but we need to start with a better understanding of ourselves and have a personal definition of success that is aligned with that." Whether or not that involves being a narcissist is up to you.

Libya’s most powerful military commander has declared victory in the three-year battle to liberate Benghazi from jihadist militias.

Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar announced that his troops had seized the final district of Libya’s second city from extremists, including fighters loyal to Islamic State.

“Benghazi has entered into a new era of safety and peace,” said General Haftar, dressed in a white uniform during a televised address. "Your armed forces declare to you the liberation of Benghazi from terrorism, a full liberation and a victory of dignity.”

The victory marks a major advance for the Gaddafi-era commander, who is backed by Egypt and UAE, and now controls most of east Libya and the country's oil crescent. It bolsters his chances of becoming the country’s new military…

Why go now?

No longer just the temple-studded gateway to Thailand’s jungly, mountainous north, Chiang Mai has a new draw: it’s Asia’s coolest creative city. In recent years Chiang Mai has become a hub for digital nomads and creatives thanks to cheap rents, fast 4G connections and an explosion of co-working spaces such as Punspace Nimman (1) and Mana Coworking (2).

Hipsters aside, if you’re here in April, the annual Songkran (Thai New Year) celebrations turn Chiang Mai into a giant water fight. That’s great timing, since the temperatures nudge a sweaty 40C during spring.

There are worse places to work – join the digital nomads at Punspace

Get your bearings

Anchored by the Ping River (3), a tributary of the Chao Phraya, second city Chiang Mai feels almost sleepy compared to Bangkok. This is no bad thing: Chiang Mai’s compactness is its biggest asset.

The main temples and markets all lie within the old city walls, an area of one square mile. You’ll probably want to sleep outside of it, though – its streets are thronged with tuk-tuks, backpackers on motorbikes and cheap massage joints. Chiang Mai, once the capital of the ancient kingdom of Lanna, runs on tuk-tuks and you can get almost anywhere in the back of one – even to the departures door of the airport (4).

The government tourist office (5) (tourismchiangmai.org) is on Chiang Mai-Lamphun Road, although you’ll find your hotel is more useful when it comes to organising tours and suggesting itineraries.

The Ninman Mai? Design Hotel: that question mark isn’t a typo

Day one

Take a view

The view from sacred Wat Phra That Doi Suthep (6), Chiang Mai’s main temple, is the city’s most blockbuster panorama. It’s even more spectacular at sunrise if jetlag’s got you in its clutches – the only downside being you’ll have to climb 309 stairs up the Naga Serpent Staircase to see it.

Dating back to the 14th century and still a working monastery, the gilded temple complex is 15km outside the city. Make your way past orange-draped monks, golden spires and shrines to the far side of the wat for a view over Chiang Mai and the lush mountains beyond. If you don’t fancy the full day’s hike up the hill, flag a songthaew – a pick-up truck acting as a shared taxi – from the Old City (7).

Take a hike

Back down the hill, get your songthaew to leave you at Nimmanhaemin Road (8), the epicentre of hipster Chiang Mai, where South-east Asia’s espresso-fuelled digital nomads have made their home. Walk down the kilometre-long road (they call it “Nimman”) and spy them tapping on fancy laptops, drinking tiny coffees at Ristr8to (9) (0066 53 215278; ristr8to-coffee-chiangmai.com) at number 15/3, famed for its latte art; sipping European beers at Beer Republic (10) (0066 53 216568; beerrepublicchiangmai.com) at number 11; or nosing around the rotating art and installations at cosy Gallery Seescape (11) (0066 93 831 9394; facebook.com/galleryseescape) at 22/1.

Fancy latte art at Ristr8to Coffee (Facebook)

Lunch on the run

Yayee Hotel (12) (0066 99 269 5885, hotelyayee.com), at 17/5 Sainumphueng Road, is the hipster lunch venue of choice (“yayee” means “darling” in Thai). The in-house Hungry Heart Café serves a menu spanning Northern Thai and Western plates and the cocktails (if you make lunch a liquid one) come from mixologist Nath Arjharn, newly arrived from Bangkok bar Hyde and Seek. It’s not just for lunch, though; come back after 5pm, when the rooftop opens, for fantastic panoramas overlooking the northern Thai hills and Doi Suthep (6).

Cultural afternoon

You might’ve come to Chiang Mai to hang out with South-east Asia’s creatives, but you’ll want to see some temples too – there are over 300 in the city alone, and some of the most impressive are within the Old City walls. Start at bling Wat Phra Singh (13), guarded by golden lions. Cool off with a fresh juice from the stalls outside before walking up to vast Wat Chedi Luang (14), a crumbly, terracotta, elephant statue-studded complex.

Meet the locals at the Elephant Jungle Sanctuary

An aperitif

When the sun goes down, Charoenrat Road (15), on the banks of the Ping River, amps up. At number 89, join local musicians and blissed-out tourists sitting cross-legged on rattan mats, listening to grungy live bands and slurping huge bottles of icy Chang beer at The Old Place (16) (0066 61 318 1256; facebook.com/theoldplacecafe).

Dine with the locals

A few doors down, at 25-29 Charoenrat Road, you’ll find The Gallery Restaurant (17) (0066 53 248601; thegallery-restaurant.com), a riverside joint that fuses local art and food. Standout dishes include sour/spicy tom yum soup and khao soy noodles (made with coconut milk and usually chicken, a Chiang Mai specialty). It’s a local restaurant with high-class visitors: Hillary Clinton paid a visit in 1996. If that doesn’t suit, try smart, candlelit Riverside Bar & Restaurant (18) (0066 53 243239; theriversidechiangmai.com) nearby at 9-11 Charoenrat Road.

Check in with the nomads at Hotel Yayee

Day two

Out to brunch

Just south of Chedi Luang (19), at 175/12 Rachadamnoen Road, is My Secret Café in Town (20) (0066 81 499 9911; facebook.com/mysecretcafeintown), though it’s anything but secret. Soothe your hangover with smoothies, Thai ice tea and pastries (including gluten-free goodies, naturally) in its mosaic- and flower-filled setting. It’s not just one for brunch – it’s open 8am-10pm, and if you’re here on a Tuesday night, there’s live music.

Window shopping

The still-developing district of Wat Umong (21) is home to a newly built “artists’ village”, Baan Kang Wat (22). On Sundays, alongside the coffee shops, tiny galleries and gift boutiques, local artisans gather to sell their work in leafy surroundings. Films are screened in the intimate amphitheatre. It’s open 11am-6pm, Tuesday to Sunday. Afterwards, waltz over to flamboyant The House (23) (0066 53 4190 1113; thehousethailand.com) at 199 Moon Muang Road, a shop-restaurant combo where you’ll find a mash-up of local art, French DJs streamed through the sound system, a mini boutique selling bold kitchenware and trinkets, and homemade cakes and smoothies. It’s open 9am-11pm.

Take a ride

Around 40 miles outside the city is the Elephant Jungle Sanctuary (24) (0066 95 698 4422; elephantjunglesanctuary.com), a conservation effort spearheaded by Chiang Mai locals and hill tribes to protect Thailand’s pachyderms. A half-day tour (12-6.30pm, £40) allows you to interact with the animals in a safe but playful environment – you’ll feed them bananas, give them a mud bath and then wash them off in the river.

My Secret Cafe in Town perfects ‘tropical hipster’ (Facebook)

The icing on the cake

The night bazaar (25) on Chang Klan Road does tender skewers of gai yang (grilled chicken), buckets of fresh juices, slices of durian and mango and bowls of khao soy for pocket change. Its lively atmosphere and trendy crowd don’t hurt, either. Open 7pm-12am daily.

Travel essentials

Getting there

Flying from the UK will require a stopover either in the Middle East or Asia. Thai Airways (0844 561 0911; thaiairways.com) flies via Bangkok from £511 return.

Chiang Mai International Airport is a 15 minute drive from the centre. As the airport is so close to town, public transport is limited – but there are plenty of cheap private options. The easiest way is to flag a tuk-tuk or a songtheaw outside the terminal building, where you’ll pay no more than 100 baht to your hotel (around £2.20). Alternatively, find the pre-paid taxi stand outside arrivals. You’ll get a coupon with the price written on it (no more than 300 baht, around £6.70 – barter it down if the quote is higher than this) and then pay at your destination.

Staying there

It’s no typo – boutique bolthole Nimman Mai? Design Hotel (26) (0066 53 400 567; nimmanmaihotel.com) on Nimman is so hip it has that question mark in its name. Interiors are inspired by different countries along the Silk Road. Doubles from around £50 per night, B&B.

Sridonchai Road’s urban resort Yaang Come Village (27) (+66 5323 7222, yaangcome.com) is quiet and jungly with an Instagrammable pool and rustic rooms, all with balconies. Doubles from around £100 per night, B&B.

The best hotel in town is the turbo-luxe Anantara (28) (+66 53 253 333, anantara.com) on the banks of the Ping River. The vibe is colonial-meets-contemporary-Thai – it’s a tranquil place to relax for a few days. Doubles from £185 per night, B&B.

People on all sides of the political spectrum are beginning to talk about the idea of basic income — the idea of paying, without conditions and independent of all other earned income, a monthly stipend just large enough for the meeting of every citizen's basic needs, like food and shelter.

Talking is extremely important for everyone to be doing, but as the saying goes, it's also cheap. So as the world talks about it, I'm already living it.

Since January 2016, I've been getting a basic income made possible by the crowdfunding platform Patreon. I now have over 300 patrons, allowing me tostart each month with $1,000— just at the poverty line in the US ($12,060 per year). This is a floor of economic security, and I'm free to earn as much additional income as I choose.

While headlines about machines eliminating job s provoke feelings of anxiety in many people, I'm not one of them. I feel a sense of security, since I know there's always going to be a bare minimum income on the first of each month.

Understandingthe true meaning and importance of security was the first thing I learned from obtaining my own basic income, but it wasn't the last. Here's how having basic income affected events in my life over the past year and a half, and what it further revealed to me about the idea.

Basic income as infrastructure

Starting at $1,000 instead of $0 each month not only provides security, but also functions as a kind of liquid infrastructure. Since it can be used to buy anything , it can take any form, and when something critical is unexpectedly lost, that object can be more easily replaced.

I experienced this when a tornado unexpectedly showed up near where I was driving and broke a window in my car. Replacing that window was something I couldn't avoid, and it wasn't covered by insurance.

That's the kind of sudden unavoidable expense that can cause rapid downward spirals for many. Just over half the population of the US can't handle a $400 expense without going into debt. With basic income, replacing my window was just a matter of shifting discretionary income priorities instead of skipping bills or going into debt.

Basic income as space

Earlier this year, I lost one of the closest friends I ever had . He was my dog and we'd journeyed through life together for almost 13 years. He died on a Friday night, and that Monday I was so grateful to have a day to grieve by myself. I couldn't imagine being forced to work that day, and it made me wonder just how many people out there are going through matters in their lives that basic income would help with mentally.

Someone need not be self-employed for basic income to give them that extra bit of courage to tell their boss they need to take the day off. But without basic income, they would go to work and be practically worthless, their minds firmly elsewhere instead of on the job.

Sometimes we just need space. The unconditionality of basic income helps in creating the space necessary to just be for awhile.





Basic income as duty

In 2016, for the first time in my life, I received a jury summons. It involved giving up four full days during the week in service to my fellow citizens, and it was entirely unpaid.

From early in the morning until later in the afternoon, I sat as part of the jury pool, all of us waiting to be called into a courtroom for possible selection. If we were chosen, only then would we get paid — and it would be just $25 for one day.

But all of us had to take that time off anyway, selected or not, paid or not. Here in Louisiana, employers are only mandated to pay for one day, but we serve a minimum of four days. That meant some people in the room with me were using paid vacation days. Others were using sick days, and still others were just there, actively prevented from earning any money.

The right to trial by jury is important; it's also our constitutional right. But that right imposes a duty on all citizens, and we pay in the form of time.

During the days I waited around in the basement of my city's courthouse, the price I paid was different than my fellow citizens, because it didn't impact my sense of security. Someone in that room might have been worrying about how they'd pay all their bills that month thanks to losing four days worth of income. That person wasn't me.

I also felt a sense of pride, not anger, at being called to serve. That made me wonder: Are people always talking about how to get out of jury duty because universal basic income doesn't exist?

If we all chose to compensate each other for citizenship, would that help change the way we look at our duties as citizens? Would we take greater pride in jury duty and even the act of voting if we recognized that citizenship itself is a form of work? I think the answer may be yes .

Basic income is more than just extra money. It symbolizes what money can become, and that includes space .

It's about citizens reflecting on what the word "money" really means, and what we owe ourselves as citizens of a great nation built on securing our rights as human beings.

South African President Jacob Zuma is facing his fifth vote of no confidence, with even his most powerful political allies calling for his resignation following a string of scandals.

The motion has been tabled by the Democratic Alliance (DA), the largest opposition party, after Zuma sacked finance minister Pravin Gordhan against the wishes of senior members of his African National Congress (ANC) party.

Gordhan was replaced by Malusi Gigaba, a Zuma loyalist with no business or financial experience.

Zuma is defiant and insists he has the full backing of his party and the country - but has the 75-year-old run out of political lives?

What does Zuma say?

Speaking last week, after South Africa's supreme court ruled the no-confidence motion could be held in private, Zuma said there was no evidence the party or the public were unhappy with his leadership.

"The ANC elected me to be president," he told parliament. "The day the ANC thinks I can't be president, it will remove me. The ANC has not done so, so I can't do so."

What does the public think?

Most polls give the so-called "people's president" the lowest approval rating for any leader since the end of apartheid.

Nearly two-thirds of South Africans think he should stand down, according to an Ipsos survey conducted last month.

In addition, the poll found 62 per cent of ANC voters disapprove of Zuma, with 18 per cent saying they support him completely.

"This is a major decline for the president, who had the support of 54 per cent of ANC voters in December 2016," says eNCA news channel, which commissioned the survey.

The scale of public dissatisfaction with the ANC and its leader was evident in last year's municipal elections, which were widely billed as a referendum on Zuma's premiership. The party suffered its biggest electoral setback since it swept to power in 1994 under Nelson Mandela and lost control of key urban areas to the DA.

However, "talk to people in Zuma's heartland in rural KwaZulu-Natal and the support for their man is unwavering," says the BBC's Alastair Leithead.

What about the ANC?

After the secret ballot ruling was handed down, the party publicly rallied behind its leader, with chief whip, Jackson Mthembu saying: "We have unqualified and unequivocal confidence in the ANC caucus not to vote in support of a motion to remove the president."

However, behind closed doors, divisions run deep.

"I would vote for him to go," one ANC MP told Reuters on condition of anonymity. "He is ruining the country."

Several ANC grandees, including deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa and secretary general Gwede Mantashe, also broke rank and openly criticised Zuma over his cabinet reshuffle, a move that additionally lost the President the support of his party's traditional allies - the Congress of South African Trade Unions and the South African Communist Party.

So is Zuma on his way out?

While the President appears to have lost the support of most ordinary South Africans, it would be unwise to predict the political demise of a man who has spent his entire career rewarding loyalty.

In order for the motion of no confidence to succeed, at least 50 ANC MPs would have to cross the floor and that is unlikely to happen, even if the vote is held in secret.

"Zuma is doing everything possible to make the case for him to be removed as president," says journalist Ranjeni Munusamy in the Daily Maverick. "Still, he remains untouchable."

(ROUGH CUT - NO REPORTER NARRATION) A South Korean barista is gaining popularity online with his recreations of famous paintings like 'The Starry Night' in coffee. Lee Kang-bin's passion started at the age of 17 when he first learned how to make coffee. Three years later, he made it for his fellow troops during his military service at a camp near the border with North Korea. He started making coffee art, or 'cream art coffee' as it is referred to on social media, after leaving the military at the age of 21. Two years later, he opened his own cafe, Cafe C. Through, in central Seoul. Lee now has over 160, 000 followers on Instagram. He teaches baristas around the world how to produce coffee art, and has also started classes for enthusiasts in Seoul. Each cup of art costs 10,000 won ($8.72), slightly more expensive than a regular latte found in other cafes in the South Korean capital.

Theresa May raised the spectre of a Greek-style economic collapse if Britain fails to press ahead with tackling the deficit on Wednesday, as she was challenged repeatedly by Jeremy Corbyn over the public sector pay cap.

With intense political pressure on the prime minister – including from her own cabinet colleagues – to ease the strain for cash-strapped public servants, including nurses and teachers, she warned MPs about the risks of loosening the purse strings.

“This is not a theoretical issue. Let us look at those countries that failed to deal with it. In Greece, where they have not dealt with the deficit ... What did we see with that failure to deal with the deficit? Spending on the health service cut by 36%. That does not help nurses or patients,” she said.

PMQs verdict: Corbyn goes on offensive as May channels Osborne Read more

Comparisons with Greece were repeatedly used by George Osborne in 2010 to justify public spending cuts, as riots erupted on the streets of Athens over the stringent bailout conditions imposed by the International Monetary Fund and the eurozone.

But the analogy represented a significant ratcheting up of the pro-austerity argument from May.

A Conservative spokesman emphasised remarks afterwards, saying: “There are siren calls from Labour to abandon any kind of fiscal restraint whatsoever. What happens, we’ve seen as a case study, is what happened in Greece.” He added: “I think she was suggesting if Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party got the chance to impose its fiscal policies on the United Kingdom that is a very real threat.”

A spokesman for Corbyn described the claims as “preposterous”. “The situation in Greece is tied up with the eurozone and the management of the eurozone banks – we’re not remotely in that situation. Our manifesto and our pledges were costed, unlike the government’s,” he said.

Many Conservative MPs have returned to Westminster after the bruising election campaign, determined to urge the government to allay some of the concerns about spending cuts they heard from voters – including on school funding, as well as public sector pay.

Some would like to see May give a clear signal before parliament breaks up for the summer recess on 20 July that the 1% across-the-board cap will be lifted.

The chief secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, must write a letter to the independent pay review bodies shortly, setting out their remit and would be expected to reinforce the 1% cap.

The Labour leader used all his questions to the prime minister at their weekly head to head to pressure her over issues of pay, accusing her of presiding over “a low-pay epidemic” in the UK, and claiming she had presided over “a week of flip-flopping and floundering”.

May outlined the process by which a series of pay review bodies recommend rises for NHS staff, teachers and others, and said the government would “consider those reports very carefully”. But she added: “We will always recognise the need to makes those decisions against the need to live within our means.” Both she and Corbyn valued the contribution of public sector workers, May said but added: “The difference is, I know we have to pay for them.”

Several other ministers and aides went on to echo the comparison with Greece in a sign there is a concerted effort by the Conservatives to stress their desire for “sound money” and attack Labour on the issue of economic competence.

Truss said the cap on public sector pay was the “responsible thing to do” in response to an urgent question from Labour.



Philip Hammond, who has admitted that he would have liked the economy to play a more central role in the election campaign, has resisted pressure to ease up on austerity, warning his cabinet colleagues that money to fund extra spending pledges would have to come from cuts elsewhere or tax increases.

One suggestion is that the Treasury could cancel planned tax cuts, including to the rate of corporation tax, as the Labour manifesto mooted. At 19%, the tax is already one of the lowest among major economies, but it is due to be reduced further, to 17%, in a move introduced by Osborne.

A thinktank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, calculates that scrapping the public sector pay cap altogether, as Labour would like to do, would cost government departments and local government £6.3bn per year compared with the government’s plans – increasing to £9.2bn per year by 2021–22.

Corbyn will give a speech to the British Chambers of Commerce on Thursday, calling for economic reform – including a greater role for the state in developing and promoting new technologies, to prevent another “lost decade” of weak growth.

He will argue that technological development, “can’t be left to the market”. “Technological change, from automation to decarbonisation, means that many jobs and industries will disappear or shrink in the coming years and decades. But I am not one of the doom-mongers, who believe that will inevitably herald an era of mass unemployment.

“At every stage of economic and industrial history, jobs, industries and skills have been lost, replaced and transformed. But whether that happens at huge social cost, as it did, for example, in the early days of the Industrial Revolution and the Luddites, or is embraced and benefits everybody, depends on managing and planning for technological change. We can’t simply leave it to the market.”

A taskforce has been appointed to manage key services at Kensington and Chelsea council, reports The Independent.

Communities Secretary Sajid Javid will announce that a team of outside experts will be manage the likes of housing, regeneration, community engagement and governance services following criticism over the council's handling of the tragedy.

The move will be confirmed in a written statement to MPs, says The Guardian, which adds the taskforce "is expected to be phased in as the current Grenfell Tower response team is gradually wound down". Both the council leader and chief executive have resigned in the aftermath of the 14 June fire.

Eleanor Kelly, spokeswoman for the Grenfell Response Team, welcomed the news, telling BBC Radio London: "We can't stay in a crisis mode for an extended period of time because everybody needs to actually feel that things have gone back to a level of stability."

At least 80 people are believed to have died in the fire, although the exact number won’t be known for months because of the extent of the damage.

The coroner leading the inquest into the blaze yesterday told survivors the scene at Grenfell was "apocalyptic" during an angry meeting at the Olympia conference centre in West Kensington.

Nabil Choucair, who fears he lost six members of his family, told the BBC: "We personally asked, 'Where is our family?' We want to know: are our family's bodies still there and is there anything from them?

"Whatever it is, we want to know exactly what it is, do not hide anything. But the answers that were coming back were, 'We don't know. We don't know. We don't know.'"

Controversial judge to head Grenfell Tower inquiry

29 June

Sir Martin Moore-Bick, a retired appeals court judge, has been appointed to head the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire, in which at least 80 people died.

He promised it would be "a vigorous inquiry that gets to the truth" and said he understood the "desire of local people for justice", but warned the scope of his report would be limited.

He also said he aimed to produce an interim report within a year and would focus on the start and rapid development of the fire, along with recommendations on how to prevent similar disasters.

"I'm well aware the residents and the local people want a much broader investigation and I can fully understand why they would want that - whether my inquiry is the right way in which to achieve that I'm more doubtful," he told the Daily Telegraph.

Moore-Bick has been praised in the past for his rulings, with justice minister Dominic Raab saying he had applied "long awaited common sense" to human rights law.

However, some of his decisions involving housing have been viewed as controversial.

Among them was his decision to allow Westminster City Council to rehouse a single mother with five children more than 50 miles away in Milton Keynes. The decision was overturned by the Supreme Court, The Guardian reports.

Nevertheless, he is widely respected in the legal profession, adds the paper, although he will have to gain the confidence of the north Kensington community around Grenfell, some of whom he met today.

Educated at Christ's College, Cambridge, Moore-Bick spent decades as a judge of the commercial court and the court of appeal. His main work involved contracts, insurance and banking.

Theresa May says Grenfell residents will be given a say over the direction of the investigation and state funding will be provided for legal representation at the inquiry.

Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Police announced yesterday it may not have a final death toll from the blaze until the end of this year.

Detective Superintendent Fiona McCormack said: "There are 23 flats that, despite huge investigative efforts, we have been unable to trace anyone that lives there.

"At this stage we must presume that no one in those flats survived, that includes anyone who lived there or was visiting them."

More than 60 organisations have now been identified as being involved in the tower's refurbishment, which may have helped the blaze spread, the London Evening Standard reports.

Councils split on how to deal with cladding

27 June

Theresa May has announced a major national investigation into the use of cladding on tower blocks after the government announced that every single sample submitted for safety checks in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster failed to pass fire safety tests.

Ministers said that 95 high-rises in 32 councils had so far been deemed to be at risk - a 100 per cent failure rate, reports ITV.

According to The Guardian, samples from schools and hospitals have also been requested but it is unclear whether any have been tested.

It is believed all the tests so far have involved owned by local authority high-rises rather than private buildings, the paper adds.

However, councillors are unsure how to proceed.

On Friday night, Camden council in north London ordered thousands of residents of the Chalcots Estate to leave their flats after fire inspectors found the tower blocks contained combustible cladding.

The scene was chaotic. Reuters describes "residents clutch[ing] children, pets and small amounts of clothing and food [as they tried] to find a bed in a local hotel or with family or friends", adding that "many were directed to inflatable beds laid out on the floor of the local sports hall.

Camden council said yesterday that 14 people were still staying at a nearby leisure centre while the majority of residents were housed in temporary accommodation.

However, according to the Guardian, more than 100 people have refused to leave their homes and have criticised the council for not offering livable alternatives.

Resident Mandy Ryan, who lives with her disabled son, says she was offered a flat with a broken boiler and a faulty cooker, the i newspaper reports.

"We are not the villains here, we are the victims," she said. "We are not trying to impede any work whatsoever, we just want suitable accommodation. We are all scared, we are disrupted, we don't know how we are going to cope, cook, wash or anything at the moment."

Camden council leader Georgia Gould said residents who refused to leave risked "delaying the work that is required… to make these homes safe".

Coaxing unwilling residents to vacate their homes is the council's preferred strategy, says Sky, but the i warns officials could take legal action against those who refuse to leave as a last resort.

Other residents have told the Daily Mail they are being intimidated by security guards into leaving against their will.

Other local authorities have taken a different tact.

Evenlode and Windrush Towers in Oxford says there it has no plans to re-house residents living in towers where the cladding has been deemed a danger, reports the Oxford Mail.

Bob Price, head of Oxford City Council, said such a move was "not necessary" while they replace the material.

However, residents were reportedly "aghast at [this] news", with one telling the paper: "I'm not going to be able to sleep at night."

Survivors of the Grenfell Tower disaster, meanwhile, have been promised temporary social housing in Kensington Row, a £2bn luxury apartment block currently under construction, reports the London Evening Standard.

This follows intense criticism of the relief effort of Kensington and Chelsea - a precursor to the criticism now emerging as local authorities pursue distinct and uncoordinated responses to safety concerns.

Grenfell Tower fire: Police consider manslaughter charges

23 June

Police are looking into the possibility of manslaughter charges as part of the investigation into the Grenfell Tower fire in west London as councils rush to remove flammable cladding on buildings across the UK.

Detective Superintendent Fiona McCormack said that officers had established that the fire wasn't started deliberately. The initial cause was a faulty Hotpoint fridge-freezer that wasn't subject to a recall.

McCormack added that the authorities were trying to get to the bottom of why the fire spread so rapidly.

Hotpoint issued a safety notice today urging customers with model numbers FF175BP or FF175BG to call or register their details.

If you own a fridge freezer model number FF175BP or FF175BG call 0800 316 3826 or visit https://t.co/bwgRzMeGvk to register your details pic.twitter.com/zObSjulyry — Hotpoint UK (@HotpointUK) June 23, 2017

Manslaughter charges are among a string of offences being considered by police as part of the investigation.

Documents and materials have been seized from a "number of organisations", McCormack added.

She said: "We are looking at every criminal offence from manslaughter onwards, we are looking at every health and safety and fire safety offence and we are reviewing every company at the moment involved in the building and refurbishment of Grenfell Tower."

Combustible cladding is suspected to have aided the "rapid and unprecedented" spread of the fire.

Sam Webb, an architect who investigated 2009's deadly Lakanal House fire in south-east London, told the Architect's Journal that similar aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding has been found to be flammable elsewhere. The material has been linked to fires in Australia, Russia and the United Arab Emirates.

In addition to the cladding, insulation recovered from Grenfell Tower has also been tested. Both failed the safety tests, with the insulation proving "more flammable than the cladding," says The Times.

Police say the number of people presumed dead remains at 79 but the number could rise.

Council fears

The news comes as thousands of tower block residents around the UK were warned that their homes may be clad with the same ACM panels believed to have fuelled the blaze.

Downing Street says it has identified 11 tower blocks across eight local authority areas with similar ACM cladding to the one used on Grenfell Tower. In total about 600 towers across the UK are having their cladding tested.

The revelation came as Camden council began urgently removing cladding from some of its buildings after laboratory tests revealed they contained the same flammable material as the one used on Grenfell Tower.

The council said it would take "urgent legal advice" after the panels it ordered for the blocks were not fitted as commissioned. It also said it would "immediately begin preparing to remove these external cladding panels from the five tower blocks".

Rydon was the main contractor, but the firm subcontracted the design and installation of the external cladding to Harley Facades, Metro News reports.

Harley's managing director, Ray Bailey, told ITV News: "These works were as described in the contractual specification and approved in the usual process for construction and building control by the London Borough of Camden."

"There is no evidence to suggest that this product and cladding system installed in Camden is unsafe."

Islington Council has also confirmed that cladding is to be removed from Braithwaite House, a high-rise block within the borough, after tests revealed the presence of ACM.



Private sector concern

The government has encouraged private landlords to send in samples for testing but they are under no obligation to do so, "raising concerns for those renting in the private sector," says The Independent.

The UK’s largest hotel group, Premier Inn, has announced that three of its properties in Maidenhead, Brentford and Tottenham will be investigated as they "have concerns that the fire-retardant cladding used may not adhere to recognised government guidance."

Hotels with Flammable Cladding as #GrenfellTower will keep it on, like Maidenhead's Premier Inn ??#GreenforGrenfellpic.twitter.com/FQpOAutLau — Corbynator (@Corbynator2) June 23, 2017

Downing Street says the 600 buildings identified yesterday for testing are all local authority-owned buildings. Local authorities are also examining schools and hospitals, The Guardian reports citing a Downing Street spokeswoman.

But No 10 also says building regulations will be examined to see if the standards were high enough in light of the Grenfell fire.

"In terms of regulations, we are going to have to reflect on issues that have been thrown up on building regulations and I'm sure there will be recommendations and issues raised throughout the inquiry that [the] government will have to immediately look at to make sure the regulations are much clearer if that is proved to be an issue," the Guardian says.

Grenfell Tower fire: 'Combustible' cladding found in three new tower blocks

22 June

Theresa May revealed today that urgent tests on tower blocks following the Grenfell Tower blaze had revealed "combustible" cladding on a "number" of buildings.

Speaking to MPs in the Commons, the Prime Minister said initial results had shown other blocks had seemingly used flammable cladding, reports The Guardian.

A No 10 spokeswoman later said three samples had been found to be combustible.

She added it would be "irresponsible" to reveal the exact locations of the tower blocks at risk as residents were still being informed and authorities were working to ensure their safety. All three buildings are in England.

The spokeswoman said: "In terms of how many buildings and how many homes have this type of cladding, the estimate provided to us by councils is that there are approximately 600 high-rise buildings with similar cladding. We are in touch with all the local authorities to encourage them to urgently send us the samples and then we will carry out the checks that we need to see where we are with that."

The Daily Telegraph adds that she said that "obviously nobody will be living in buildings that are unsafe" and that residents "will be rehoused if they need to be".

The exact scale of the problem is unknown. While the Financial Times said the government was testing "thousands" of buildings to see if they had cladding similar to that used on Grenfell, the Guardian and others reported that tests were being carried out on 600 high-rise buildings.

The No 10 spokeswoman said the Department for Communities and Local Government was coordinating the process and facilities to allow for 100 samples a day to be tested.

The government is also making its cladding checking facilities available to private landlords for free, raising the prospect that many more residents will be affected.

The news follows the resignation of Nicholas Holgate, the chief executive of Kensington and Chelsea council, who says he was asked to step down by Communities Secretary Sajid Javid following the Grenfell Tower blaze.

In a statement released by the council, Holgate said the minister had "required the leader of the council to seek my resignation", reports the BBC.

He added he would have liked to have stayed on, but felt it necessary to resign. "There is a huge amount still to do for the victims of the fire requiring the full attention of this council and many others," he said.

"If I stayed in post, my presence would be a distraction."

"His resignation comes after a tide of criticism of the council, not only for the way it responded to the Grenfell Tower tragedy but also for historical neglect of poorer residents of the borough and a neglect of social housing," The Guardian says.

Yesterday, the Communities Secretary announced that survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire would be rehoused in 68 flats within the social housing wing of Kensington Row, a £2bn luxury apartment block currently under construction.

"Two bedroom flats are currently being advertised for up to £2.4 million," says the London Evening Standard, "but it is understood the City of London Corporation paid around £10 million for the flats thanks to an 'extraordinary gesture' of goodwill by developer St Edward in selling the properties at their cost price."

Grenfell Tower: Families only given £200,000 from £5m fund

20 June

A total of £202,000 in government aid has been paid out to 180 families directly affected by the Grenfell Tower fire, says the Grenfell Response Team set up to manage the official response to the tragedy.

Householders have received payments of £500 in cash and £5,000 in bank deposits, but the money is only a fraction of the £5m government fund.

The delays can partly be explained by the confusion over how to distribute the money. Volunteer Nisha Parti told ITV survivors were getting just £10 from the local council days after the fire, reports the London Evening Standard.

Parti added: "There is money pouring in from all these amazing volunteers. We can't get access to the money and we cannot get it to the families."

However, The Independent reported that some undocumented migrants affected by the blaze may not be seeking state support due to fears over their immigration status. The paper says they are "are afraid to seek help from authorities for fears that they could be referred onto police or the Home Office".

Mike Adamson, chief executive of the British Red Cross, told The Guardian the charity had increased its involvement amid concerns that some victims were unregistered asylum seekers.

"Our refugee services are working to find anyone who is undocumented and worried to present to the authorities," he said.

Grenfell Tower fire: Deaths expected to rise to 79

19 June

The number of people dead or presumed dead in the Grenfell Tower fire in west London has increased to 79, the Metropolitan Police said this morning.

The figure doesn't include the 18 people who remain in hospital nine of whom are in a critical condition, the BBC reports.

Identifying the victims will take several weeks due to the "indescribable" conditions within the tower, Commander Stuart Cundy told the BBC.

According to Cundy, the "terrible reality" is that some people's remains may never be identified because of the intensity of the fire.

"There is also a real possibility that there may be people in the building that no one knows are missing," he added.

The fire swept through the 24-storey Grenfell Tower estate in North Kensington on 13 June. Many of the families affected lost more than one relative in the fire, Cundy told the BBC. Some of the identified victims include a family of five – Abdul Aziz El-Wahabi, his wife Fouzia and their three children ages 21, 16 and eight – all of whom are presumed dead, Sky News reports.

"This is an incredibly distressing time for families," said Cundy. "It is really hard to describe the devastation the fire caused. What is important for me is to find answers for those families who have been directly affected."

The investigation into the missing people and how the fire began will be "wide-ranging" and will delve into the construction of the building, the recent renovations to its cladding and its fire safety measures, among other things.

Several government bodies have been criticised for their mishandling of the building and the fire's aftermath. Many Londoners have expressed anger towards the Kensington and Chelsea Council, which manages the estate. Critics include London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who said last week that the fire was a "preventable accident" caused by "years of neglect" by the council, according to BT.

Cundy said he would like to "reassure everybody" that he will be looking into all the criminal offences that could have allowed the fire to happen, whether by an individual or an organisation.

"Where offences have been committed, I will do everything in my gift to make sure they [the perpetrators] are brought to justice," he added.

Grenfell Tower: fireproof cladding 'would have cost just £5,000 more'

16 June

Cladding used in the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower in North Kensington could have been replaced with a fire-retardant version for just £5,000, The Times reports.

The aluminium cladding has a polyethylene core, which in the US is banned on buildings more than 40ft high, or about four storeys tall. Grenfell Tower has 24 storeys.

The UK Building Research Establishment "warned last year that the drive for greater energy efficiency meant more and more buildings are being wrapped in materials that could go up in flames", The Guardian says.

A "rough calculation" by The Times suggests that a little over 2,000 square metres of the panelling, made by a company called Reynobond, was used on Grenfell Tower. The same company's fire-resistant panel sells for £24 per square metre – £2 more than the standard version. Therefore, the newspaper said, Grenfell could have been clad in the fire-resistant material for less than £5,000 more.

The confirmed death toll from the fire now stands at 30, but the BBC says 76 people are believed to be missing.

Grenfell Tower fire: Grief turns to anger as death toll 'could soar above 100'

16 June

Anger is mounting among survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire in London as fears grow that 100 people could have been killed in the blaze.

More than 70 people still remain unaccounted for, the Daily Telegraph says, and police say it is possible some of the victims may never be identified. Emergency services are continuing to search for bodies in the burnt-out remains of the building.

Theresa May visited the scene yesterday, but was accused of failing to show "humanity" after failing to meet any of those affected.

Labour MP David Lammy, who knew people who lived in the tower block, said the fire amounted to "corporate manslaughter" and called for arrests to be made.

Writing in The Guardian, he said: "Don't let them tell you it's a tragedy. It's not a tragedy, it's a monstrous crime. Corporate manslaughter.

"They were warned by the residents that there was an obvious risk of catastrophe. They looked the other way."

Residents of the block say they repeatedly raised concerns about fire safety at Kensington and Chelsea council and the company that manages the authority's social housing, but claim their fears "fell on deaf ears".

What is corporate manslaughter?

The Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007 created a means of accountability for deaths caused by very serious management failings. Prior to the act, a senior individual who could be said to embody a company had to be found guilty first.

Who might be punished for the Grenfell Tower fire?

Corporate liability does not apply to directors or other individuals who have a senior role in the company or organisation, but "existing health and safety offences and gross negligence manslaughter continue to apply to individuals", says the Daily Telegraph.

"Prosecutions against individuals will continue to be taken where there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest to do so."

What happens next?

As yet, it is not clear what caused the fire to spread so quickly. The Prime Minister has ordered a full public inquiry into the disaster. A judge-led investigation was needed to ensure "this terrible tragedy is properly investigated", she said.

Grenfell Tower fire death toll rises to 17 - with many more expected

15 June

Officials say 17 people were killed by the fire in London's Grenfell Tower yesterday, but the number is expected to increase.

Firefighters stopped looking for bodies today as fears grew the building could collapse, The Guardian reports. It could take weeks before all the victims are recovered.

There are still hundreds of residents unaccounted for, the Daily Telegraph reports, while the Guardian adds that of the 78 people hospitalised, 37 are still being treated, with 17 of them in critical care.

Prime Minister Theresa May, who has ordered a full public inquiry into the tragedy, visited the tower block earlier today but reportedly did not speak to any residents.

A Downing Street spokesperson refused to comment on the matter, The Independent says.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also visited the scene.





Today, I spoke with residents of Grenfell Tower. We must & will do everything in our power to ensure the truth about this tragedy comes out. pic.twitter.com/28EHTVeAMS — Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) June 15, 2017

The Queen also issued a statement saying her "thoughts and prayers" were with the families affected and paid tribute to the fire services.

It is claimed that residents at Grenfell Tower, who included some of Kensington's poorest families, repeatedly raised concerns about fire safety in the building, which lacked sprinklers. However, they were reportedly ignored and allegedly even threatened with legal action.

A blog post from the Grenfell Action Group claimed "only a catastrophic event" would ensure they were heard.

Labour MP David Lammy, who knew people living in the block, called the catastrophe "corporate manslaughter".

He said: "This is the richest borough in our country treating its citizens in this way and we should call it what it is. It is corporate manslaughter. And there should be arrests made; frankly, it is an outrage."

He added that he still did not know whether his family's friends, Khadija Saye and her mother Mary Mendy, who lived on the 20th floor, had survived.

London fire: What caused the Grenfell Tower blaze and could it have been avoided?

14 June

Residents of Grenfell Tower repeatedly warned of the possibility of a "future major disaster" striking the west London tower block, which went up in flames this morning, killing at least six people.

Grenfell Action Group said they raised safety concerns when the building was refurbished last year's at a cost of £8.7m, but claimed it fell on "deaf ears".

The Times reports residents expressed their views to both the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea council, which owns the property, and the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO), which manages social housing in the borough, for more than four years.

In a blog post, the Grenfell Action Group said "only a catastrophic event" would result in their fears being heard.

Rydon Construction, the company responsible for the regeneration, has also faced criticism for removing a page from their website detailing the work.

And here's a screen grab in case the cache goes down too pic.twitter.com/QKYuxffe14 — Dawn Foster (@DawnHFoster) June 14, 2017

"The webpage, which dates back to completed work in 2016, was removed in the early hours of this morning," says Shortlist.

What happened at Grenfell Tower?

Reports of a fire began early this morning. The blaze was "believed to have started on the fourth floor and spread incredibly quickly", says the BBC.

Forty fire engines and around 200 firefighters tackled the fire.

Six people have been confirmed dead, with the number of fatalities expected to rise. NHS England said 74 people are being treated in hospital, with 20 of them in critical care.

The cause of the fire is not known, although one witness said they believed it was started by a faulty fridge.

Matt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, said "a full investigation will need to be undertaken at the first possible opportunity".

Matt Wrack from FBU on Sky says it shouldn't be possible for fire to develop in this way, major investigation needs to be made into building — Dawn Foster (@DawnHFoster) June 14, 2017

What do we know about Grenfell Tower?

The 24-storey building was built by Kensington and Chelsea Borough Council in 1974 and refurbished last year. "The exterior of the 1970s-built tower was modernised with cladding and replacement windows, while additional homes were added using vacant space in the building," says The Times.

On its website, Rydon Construction said: "Externally, rain screen cladding, curtain wall facade and replacement windows were fitted, improving thermal insulation and modernising the exterior of the building."

It is the cladding which has caused the most controversy, with several residents suggesting it contributed to the fire's spread.

One, identified as Methrob, told LBC: "The real issue was when it caught fire to the cladding outside.

"The whole one side of the building was on fire. The cladding went up like a matchstick."

This resident claims 'cheap flammable' cladding was used on #grenfelltower pic.twitter.com/5gBl17HBNm — Victoria Derbyshire (@vicderbyshire) June 14, 2017

An architect who knew the design of the building told The Guardian that 1970s blocks such as Grenfell feature "one escape stair which is not designed for a mass evacuation, but is designed for a small number of people to get out whose individual flats are on fire"

Could it have been avoided?

"The tower block was given a medium fire risk rating - defined as a normal fire risk - in 2016 following completion of the refurbishment by the London Fire Brigade and Kensington and Chelsea Borough Council," reports the BBC.

But Geoff Wilkinson, a fire and building inspector, told the broadcaster Grenfell Tower "didn't perform in the way you'd expect a building to perform" once it caught fire.

"You'd expect [the fire] to be contained to an individual apartment," he said. "Something has gone dramatically wrong here."

Residents also believe the fire could have been prevented if their concerns had been listened to.

In addition, Grenfell Action Group alleges residents were given scant information about what to do in the event of a fire.

According to the group, "a temporary notice stuck in the lift and one announcement in a recent regeneration newsletter" advised residents to remain in their flats in the event of fire.

Residents at #GrenfellTower were told to 'stay put' in event of fire 'unless it is in or affecting your flat'https://t.co/g9XHGMTdNJ pic.twitter.com/kUCnakAKjc — ITV News (@itvnews) June 14, 2017

An anonymous official told the Guardian the "stay put" strategy was intended to stop people getting hurt if a small number of flats were on fire.

They added: “The stay put strategy clearly wouldn’t work when the fire is roaring up outside the building. That is a strategy that would lead to certain death in the circumstances of this fire."

Questions have also been raised about the lack of sprinklers in the building. Ronnie King, secretary of the all-party parliamentary fire safety and rescue group, told LBC that the government had not properly reviewed a number of recommendations his group made following a similar blaze at a tower block in Camberwell in 2009.

He said: "The all-party group were looking at the issue of fire suppression in all the tower blocks with similar designs to this and we understand that there are around 4,000 tower blocks that don't have fire sprinklers fitted into them."

King added that they had strongly recommended a review of building regulations, but said former housing minister Gavin Barwell had told him he was "considering the proposals - despite the report being four years old".

London fire: Several dead as huge blaze destroys Grenfell Tower flats

14 June, 10:21 a.m.

Several people are said to have died in a massive fire that engulfed a 24-storey block of flats in west London this morning, while reports suggest some residents remain trapped in the building.

Forty fire engines and more than 200 firefighters battled the blaze at the Grenfell Tower in north Kensington, which is believed to have broken out at around 1am before spreading rapidly.

A statement from the Metropolitan Police confirmed a number of people were killed in the fire. It also said the cause of the blaze was expected to take some time to confirm.

It is unclear how many people could be trapped, but "a significant number" are unaccounted for, the BBC reports. Police have established a wide cordon amid fears the building might collapse.

Police confirmed that a number of people were being "treated for a range of injuries", while the London Ambulance service said 50 people were taken to hospital.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan declared the fire a "major incident".

Asked on Radio 4's Today programme about reports that the advice to residents was to stay inside their flats in the event of a fire, Khan said: "Thankfully residents didn't stay in their flats and fled to safety.

"One of the concerns that we have is it's a 24-storey building but for obvious reasons, with the scale of the fire, our experts weren't able to reach all the way to the top. So of course, these are questions that need to be answered as soon as possible."

Witness Tim Downie told The Guardian the "sheer scale and the speed" with which the blaze spread suggested "there must be casualties and fatalities". Others told the BBC that people inside the building at the time of the fire could be heard calling out for help, saying the smoke was too thick for them to leave their flats.

Grenfell Tower resident Sajad Jamalvatan told the paper: "There were no fire alarms at all."

Jody Martin, who heard the fire engines coming down his street, said: "I saw a woman holding her baby out the window on the west side of the building."

People inside the building were seen flashing torches or mobile phones to attract help and a witness described seeing at least one person falling from an upper floor. "Some residents were seen using bedsheets to make their escape from the tower block," the Daily Telegraph reports.

A woman called Zara said she saw a woman throw her son, who was about five years old, from a fifth or sixth-floor window to escape the blaze.

She told LBC: "One woman actually threw her son out of the window. I think he's OK. I think he might have just had some broken bones and bruises."

London Fire Brigade assistant commissioner Dan Daly described the fire as a "large and very serious incident". He also confirmed that several residents had been successfully rescued from the building.

Grenfell Tower, which contains 120 flats, is managed by the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation.

Plans and drawings lodged with the local planning department show details of a recent refurbishment project on the site. "One cross section purports to show a single stair access to the upper floors," says the Guardian.

"A blog late last year by occupants of the tower warned only a catastrophic fire in the tower would 'bring an end to the dangerous living conditions' of tenants and leaseholders," Australian newspaper The Chronicle reports.

Carol Lee Scott was best known for playing the green-faced pantomime witch Grotbags ITV/Rex Features

Carol Lee Scott, the children’s actress best known as Grotbags the witch, has died aged 74.

The entertainer appeared in numerous children’s programmes in the 1980s and early 1990s, including the ITV hit Rod Hull’s Emu’s World but was best known for her role as the green-faced pantomime witch.

Her death was announced by relatives on social media last night with her niece Gina Mear writing on Facebook that the actress had “lost her brave fight against cancer”.

“To many of you she was Grotbags — a legend!” she said. “To me she was just aunty Carol. I shall miss her hugely, rest in peace Carol.”

Celebrities and a nostalgic public also paid tribute with Rufus Hound, the comedian, saying that she was “an icon…

Tens of thousands of joyful New Zealanders have braved a thunderstorm in Auckland to welcome home the America’s Cup winners, who held the Auld Mug aloft on these shores for the first time in 17 years.

The Emirates Team New Zealand members waved at the crowd from the backs of vans for a slow, noisy procession down Queen Street to Waitemata Harbour, where they boarded a boat for a victory tour on the sea – dozens of yachts, sea kayaks and dingies floating by to catch a glimpse.

Many people skipped work and school on Thursday to watch the parade live, not wanting to miss out on the historic moment.

Daryl and Liz Kirk brought their two young daughters – nabbing prime positions outside Aotea Square and setting up camping chairs to ensure no one stole their spot – a full two hours before it began at lunchtime.

America's Cup: New Zealand celebrates 'underdog' victory over billionaires Read more

“This is a pretty historic event for us as Kiwis and we wanted the kids to be here and remember it,” said Daryl.

“Being a Kiwi means doing your best with not many resources, and being far away, but these boys are the world’s best, and as you can see today the whole country is really proud of what they’ve achieved. We all love it.”

The parade started in sunshine and ended amid claps of thunder and torrential rain. Office workers pressed themselves against windows to watch and builders paused on their scaffolding high above the city to whoop and yell.

Seagulls swooped above the cheering crowd dancing to a brass band version of James Brown’s I Feel Good. Some people had travelled from around the North Island to shout “Kiwi, Kiwi” and “Peter, Peter!” for helmsman Peter Burling, who, at 26, is the youngest person to ever win the America’s Cup, and an instant hero for locals with his uncanny resemblance to Sir Edmund Hillary.

“I wanted to support the team, I felt so happy and excited when they won,” said 14-year-old Ace Mead who missed school with her three sisters to attend the parade.

“I think the team won because they had courage and faith, and they had the whole country behind them. I got up to watch every game with my Dad.”

Many of the team – dressed in black and blue tracksuits – looked worn out from their feat in Bermuda, but their faces cracked into huge grins as the crowd embraced them, throwing colourful streamers over their heads and waving handmade signs.

This week the government announced NZ$5m in funding for the team to try and keep their sailing talent in New Zealand, but today Australian skipper Glenn Ashby told TVNZ he had already received phone calls from rival teams trying to poach him.

“I think all the guys are highly sought after because we have been able to pull of something absolutely fantastic” he said.

A number of the sailors bowed their heads at the start of the parade to hide puffy eyes, blinking back tears they were unable to control. Having only arrived back in the country yesterday, they have yet to see some friends and family, and many said they were keen for a few quiet days to recoup and process before journeying south for parades in Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.

“Thank you for your display of what is best about a small country from the bottom of the world,” said the prime minister, Bill English, from a podium by Waitemata harbour, his grey suit drooping in the rain.

“You are a group of ordinary Kiwis who have done something extraordinary,” he said, before giving cause for laughter with one of his characteristic stumbles: “You’ll also be helping Kiwis get off the shelf … ah, off the couch.”

The disclosure of intimate images now carries a maximum sentence of five years in Scotland ALAMY

Scotland’s revenge porn offence has come into force and it looks as if it will avoid some of the pitfalls of its equivalent offence in England and Wales.

The offence in Scotland criminalises the disclosure, or threatened disclosure, of images of another person in an intimate situation, intending or being reckless as to whether the victim will be caused fear, alarm or distress.

Lessons have been learnt from the experience of criminalisation in England and Wales. The offence, which came into force in 2015, prohibits the disclosure of private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress.

The attrition rate for the offence has been high and this has been attributed, in part, to the requirement that an image must be disclosed to a…

For the second time in two seasons, Chino Hill High School will be looking for a new head basketball coach. The school — which Lonzo, LiAngelo and LaMelo Ball have put on the map — has parted ways with their coach from this season, Stephan Gilling, according to the LA Times.

Gilling just finished his first season at the school, leading the Huskies to a 30-3 overall record after taking over for Steve Baik, who led the to a state championship in 2016. However, public sparring with LaVar Ball — the father of the Ball brothers — marred what was otherwise a successful season.

Gilling made national headlines a little over a month ago via an interview with USA Today, in which he described a confrontation with LaVar Ball in front of the team, which hampered chemistry going forward.

LaVar Ball responded to that accusation in an interview with Colin Cowherd on “The Herd” less than a week later [go to the 3:30 mark in the video above]:

“I’m not undermining [the program],” Ball told Cowherd. “That’s something that he said.

“He’s saying that because he’s sad now because he’s no longer in the [Ball] camp. He knew what he was getting into when he got the job. Who you think got him the job? How do you get to be a young, black coach for the No. 1 team in the nation? And you never had a freshman head coaching job?”

Ball later explained that not only did he train Gilling when he was younger, but that his wife helped him write the resume to get the head coaching job.

Regardless of the particulars, Chino Hills will be looking for a new head coach this summer.

LaMelo Ball still has two years left at the school, as middle brother LiAngelo gets set to go to UCLA and Lonzo prepares for the NBA Draft.

FOX Sports reached out to LaVar Ball for comment but he was unavailable.

Why go now?

The last few years have seen Belfast emerge from a turbulent past, and shake off its reputation as a troubled city. For years it was off the tourist scene, but now it’s firmly established itself as a destination worthy of a mini break, with bars, museums and sights to rival many a European city.

With a surge of hip new restaurant openings (and a couple of Michelin stars), there’s never been a better time for excellent food in the city, as well as a bit of craic after dinner. The short flight time and ease of access from all over the UK is a bonus, too.

Get your bearings

A relatively small city, Belfast is divided into several “quarters”, each known for its own distinct character. You’ll likely spend most of your time in the centrally-located Cathedral Quarter, with its rambling streets, buzzing pubs and top-notch restaurants. Further south is the leafy Queen’s Quarter, where you’ll find the Botanical Gardens (1) and Queen’s University (2), alongside some cool coffee shops and restaurants that are well worth the half-hour stroll. To the east, on the other side of the River Lagan, lies the Titanic Quarter, named after the infamous ship that was built there in 1912. It’s home to an impressive Titanic-themed museum (3), an 11,000-seater sports and entertainment arena called the Odyssey Complex (4), and plenty of swish new apartment buildings and restaurants on the harbour-front. Meanwhile, the Gaeltacht Quarter in the west of the city is all about Irish language and culture. Highlights include important political sites, cemeteries and locales where you can take in the best traditional dance and music Belfast has to offer.

The Visit Belfast Welcome Centre is at 9 Donegall Square North in the Cathedral Quarter (5) (028 9024 6609; visitbelfast.com). It’s open 9am-5.30pm Monday to Saturday (7pm in the summer) and 11am-4pm on Sundays.

Day one

Take a hike

Get acquainted with the city and its culinary highlights with a guided food tour. The Belfast Food Tour with Taste & Tour (tasteandtour.co.uk) starts at St George’s Market (6). Tours meander around the stalls, while you taste all the local delicacies – Suki tea, blue cheese, Broughgammon goat and “fifteens” fridge cake. Walks continue through the city, stopping at chocolatiers for truffles, bars for cider and pubs for champ. Tours cost £50 and generally run on Saturdays at 10am.

Lunch on the run

If you’re not too full from a morning of grazing, head into Coppi (7) (028 9031 1959; coppi.co.uk) opposite St Anne’s Cathedral (8), a contemporary Italian restaurant with a cool, industrial-chic vibe. A selection of their small 'cichetti' dishes make up a good lunch – try the feta fritters, sharp little bites of cheese swathed in truffle honey (£3.30). If you’re more peckish, the duck ragu with porcini mushroom ravioli (£14.50) is decadently rich, topped with crisp shards of duck skin and slivers of truffle. It’s open every day from 12pm-10pm or 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays.

Window shopping

Stroll along Wellington Street just west of Belfast City Hall (9) and you’ll find some great shops within steps of each other. Envoy of Belfast (10) (028 9031 1110; envoyofbelfast.com, closed Sundays) is home to vaguely androgynous, Scandi-style pieces, while Octopus's Garden (11) (075 63147949; belfastrecordshop.co.uk) is a must for fans of vintage and vinyl. Around the corner on Chichester Street, Co Couture (12) (078 8889 9647; cocouture.co.uk, closed Sundays) is a dreamy chocolate shop, selling divine brownies.

There’s nothing remarkable about the high street shops in the Victoria Square shopping centre (13) (victoriasquare.com), but head there anyway and climb up the spiral stairs into the glass dome for great free views of the city and out to the mountains.

Bear in mind a lot of the city’s shops are either closed on Sundays or operate on limited opening hours (usually 1-5pm).

An aperitif

There’s no shortage of great pubs in the city, particularly in the Cathedral Quarter. The party starts early on a Saturday, with groups often gathered for an afternoon pint to kick off the weekend. The Duke of York (14) (02890 241062; dukeofyorkbelfast.com) is filled with antique memorabilia, cool copper tables and an old printing press (with some dirty words hidden within the letters). It’s open every day from 11am-1am, with shorter hours on Sundays and Mondays.

Muddler’s Club focuses on seasonal ingredients (Muddler’s Club )

Game of Thrones fans should head over the road to sister pub The Dark Horse (15) (028 90 237807; dukeofyorkbelfast.com), where you’ll find a door carved from fallen trees of the Dark Hedges (AKA Kingsroad).

Dine with the locals

The lights are low in the Muddlers Club (16) (028 9031 3199; themuddlersclubbelfast.com), also in the Cathedral Quarter, and the air is scented with wafts of citrus smoke from many an artisan Old Fashioned. But the food is so good that you barely notice how cool the space is. The menu is small, with a focus on solid, seasonal ingredients – think tender slices of lamb, served with fresh spring greens, pea puree and a dollop of tangy sour cream (£24). It’s open 12-2.45pm and 5.30-10pm, closed Sundays and Mondays, and booking is essential.

Down in the Queen’s District, The Barking Dog (17) (028 9066 1885; barkingdogbelfast.com) is the place to go for laidback gastro food and, unlike many Belfast restaurants, it’s open on Sundays (their roasts are epic). Hours vary.

Day two

Out to brunch

It can be tricky to eat out on Sundays, with a lot of restaurants closing up shop. Established Coffee (18) (established.coffee) next to the cathedral is one of the few stellar joints open every day, and their weekend feasts are well worth a trip. Their Cheesy French Toast is made with a doorstop of sourdough, topped with braised kale, smoked bacon, sage hollandaise and a poached egg (£7.50). It's open 9am-6pm Sundays, other days differ.

The Botanic Gardens make for a pleasant stroll (Getty Images/iStockphoto)

A walk in the park

The Botanical Gardens (1) are in Queen’s District, around a 30-minute walk south from the Cathedral Quarter, and a great spot to spend a sunny afternoon. Stroll past the flowerbeds and trees to the Palm House, a beautiful Victorian glasshouse home to tropical plants and birds. The gardens are open every day from 7.30am-9pm, and entry is free of charge.

For a unique walk in the city centre, book in for a Street Art Tour (seedheadarts.com) which guides you through the incredible art and murals that line the streets of the Cathedral Quarter. Walks run at 12pm every Sunday from outside the Dark Horse (15), for £8.

Cultural afternoon

Belfast is synonymous with shipbuilding, and particularly its most infamous accomplishment, the Titanic. The exhibition centre, Titanic Belfast (3) (028 9076 6386; titanicbelfast.com), is based in the Titanic Quarter a short walk east from the city centre, and a striking sight in itself. The self-guided tour is insightful and sensitively interactive – a ride takes you through the “shipyard”, complete with face-warming coals; a handrail vibrates as you look out over a televised sea view. Voices from survivors depict the moment of disaster in a darkened corridor, as sounds of Morse code fill the air. Submarine footage of the wreckage is shown on a huge cinema screen and also underfoot, below a glass floor. Tickets cost £18, and include access to SS Nomadic. It’s open daily from 9am-7pm in the summer, hours vary slightly in other months.

Take a ride

The city is compact, so you’ll rarely need to use public transport. Taxis are fairly cheap, with a 10-minute ride costing around £5, and much of the city can be reached on foot. If you need them, buses run through the city and out to the airport.

To see more of the outskirts while learning about the complex history of the city, take a Blackcab Political Tour (077 9860 2401; touringaroundbelfast.com) with someone who knows the city and its intricacies inside and out. You’ll see the Peace Wall (19) and murals, and learn about The Troubles from someone who has lived through them. Tours cost £35 for up to three people or £15 per head for more.

Get your bearings

Located in the south of Mallorca and just 15 minutes by taxi or bus from the airport, Palma is simply laid out in long, straight avenues. The main square is Placa Major (1), and key areas to explore include the old town, Passeig del Born (2), La Rambla (3) and Paseo Maritimo (4), which is next to La Seu cathedral (5), and has a real buzz at night. The harbour starts at the cathedral and borders the west – the promenade runs to the ferry port approximately 3.5km from the old town. The main tourist office is Informacio Turistica de Mallorca (6), at Plaça de la Reina, 2, 07015 (+34 971 173 990; infomallorca.net).

Current exchange rate: £1 = €1.17

Day One

Window shopping

Palma has serious shopping potential with a number of trendy boutiques. However, it’s wise to check opening hours as some close for siesta (typically around 2-5pm) and/or are closed on Sundays. The area around Born, Via Roma (7) and Plaça Major has a plethora of shops for all budgets.

Palma has a vibrant shopping scene (iStock/Juergen Sack)

High up on Mallorcan fashionistas’ wishlists are Spanish designer brand Angel Schlesser, at Carrer de Sant Nicolau (8) (+34 971 71 82 73; angelschlesser.com) for women’s clothes, accessories and exclusive fragrances; and Purificacion Garcia at Placa del Mercat (9) (+34 971 71 83 97; purificaciongarcia.com), which caters for stylish men and women with bags to die for.

Lunch on the run

Try the family-run Bar Paco for homemade tapas or Ostras Cocedero for Manolo’s fresh seafood, including oysters, kipper and cod. The market’s closed on Sundays.

Cultural afternoon

Take a No 3 or No 46 bus from the main bus and train station Estacio Intermodal (12) – just off the Placa d’Espanya – for the half-hour ride to the Joan Miró Foundation (13) (+34 971 70 14 20; miro.palmademallorca.es), a museum in Cala Mayor dedicated to the work of the surrealist artist Joan Miró.

An aperitif

Day Two

Out to brunch

Ensaimadas – pastries, filled with cream, custard, chocolate or apricot – are a typical Mallorcan breakfast. Find them at their best at Ca’n Joan de S’aigo (17) (+34 971 71 07 59; canjoandesaigo.com), where prices also happen to be extremely reasonable – €3 gets you coffee with an apricot ensaimada. It’s open from 8am.

Take a hike

Start at the grand Gothic Cathedral La Seu (5) which is a must-see (+34 902 02 24 45, catedraldemallorca.org). Overlooking the harbour, it was built between the 13th and 17th centuries; Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí redesigned parts of the interior in the early 20th century. It’s open 10am-6pm Monday to Friday from June to September; 10am-5.15pm from 1 April to 31 May; and 10am-2pm Saturdays all year round. Entry costs €4.

From there, head next door to the 14th century palace La Almudaina (18) (+34 971 21 41 34; no web). Dating back to Roman times, these days the King of Spain resides here when on the island. It’s open 10am-6pm, entry €7.

La Seu Cathedral is a must-see attraction in Palma (iStock/Juergen Sack)

Turn left for a stroll along the seafront which is the perfect spot for people-watching – while you’re there drop into the La Llonja art space (19) which often has a free installation inside. Finish your walk at the historical landmark Monument a Ramon Llull (20) on Passieg de Sagrera.

A walk in the park

The most central park is Parc del Mar (21). Situated at the foot of the cathedral and a few steps from the Monument a Ramon Llull, there’s a man-made saltwater pond, fountain, tree lined promenade and lawns, plus a children’s playground. If you’re lucky you may even catch an open-air concert or cinema.

Take a ride

Jump on the vintage Soller train (+34 971 75 20 51; trendesoller.com) from Plaça de España (22). It’s a 7km trip which rises up to 199 metres, crosses several bridges and covers a scenic route from Palma to the beautiful town of Soller (23), via the Mallorcan countryside and the Tramuntana mountains.

Planes may be quicker and cars more convenient, but sleeper trains maintain an enduring grip on the imagination. One of the most enchanting is the Ranikhet Express, which trundles from the ordered chaos of Old Delhi railway station to the clean, calm air of Kathgodam, in the foothills of the Himalayas.

I awake with a start when the lights go on at 5am, having been lulled into a deep sleep by the rocking of the carriages. A tiring few days in Delhi have taken their toll. From mosque to temple to fort to palace, I pounded my way along leafy colonial avenues and the teeming alleys of the old town, soaking up their sights, sounds, smells – and dust.

Now, at the end of the line leading east towards Nepal and China, I stumble blearily towards breakfast and a first cup of masala chai. This sweet tea, spiced with ginger, cinnamon and cardamom, would revive a weary traveller from the arms of death, never mind just an overnight train and a spot of jet lag. After three cups, I am ready to face to the cool air drifting down from the mountains and contemplate the route for the next eight days.

Rohan, our guide, sets out the plan: after a three-hour drive, we will continue on foot to the first night's accommodation, a traditional farmer's cottage in the village of Deora (below). The tour operator, Shakti Himalaya, has a collection of village houses on the slopes of the mountains and the first half of my expedition will be spent roaming between them. Then we will head to 360 Leti, a spectacular luxury retreat in the shadow of the High Himalaya.

I am broken in gently with a 90-minute stroll through shady pine forests, as Rohan introduces me to the mountain way of life. Here and there he points out the places where villagers have tapped the trees for sweet-smelling resin, or lofted hay into comic-looking haystacks hanging from the branches.

I opt for the shorter of two routes to Deora and though I am just getting into my stride when we reach the village, there is an upside to our prompt arrival – a long, lazy evening with a gin and tonic. As the sun goes down, an air of deep calm settles around us. Not even a strong earth tremor that sets the trees shuddering on the hillside can upset the sense of serenity.

This corner of India has not always been peaceful. Over the centuries, several armies have swept through the mountains, leaving behind a patchwork of myths and customs - as well as unresolved tensions and border disputes. As I take pictures of the sun setting over the valley, Rohan talks of ancient migrations from the Indian plains, conquering armies from the mountains of Nepal and, of course, the long British presence.

When darkness falls and a chill descends, the cook builds us a fire. A little later, the scent of dinner wafts out from his kitchen, and soon the dishes began to appear for a lamp-lit feast under the stars. The food – chicken curry with lentil dal, chapatis and various curried vegetables – is simple but delicious.

Day two dawns cool and clear, and as the sun rises over our breakfast of fruit, cereal and eggs, the temperature climbs with it. By 9am it is warm in the sunshine and cool in the shade of the forest – perfect conditions for walking. With the luggage taken on ahead by car and porter, I set out with a spring in my step.

For the first couple of hours we wind through terraced farms that cascade down the hillsides – a style of agriculture I had previously associated with the rice paddies of southeast Asia. Rice grows here too when the monsoons come, later in the year, but in April the wheat is ripening to a golden glow and the scent of coriander floats on the breeze. Women and children break from their weeding and watering, touching their fingertips together to greet us as we pass.





Soon we leave behind the farms and the landscape changes around us. Pine trees give way to Indian oaks, darker and more spindly than their European cousins, and among them lurk a few splashes of colour from deep red rhododendrons. The final steady climb towards lunch lifts us out of the valley and onto a ridge, where a picnic is prepared.

Pressing on, we continue past great seams of rock exposed by landslides. Each monsoon brings fresh falls, Rohan explains, as rain-sodden topsoil loses its grip on the steep slopes. The rock beneath carries scars of a deeper restlessness: the tectonic forces unleashed as India burrows its way under China.

Great bands of sediment that once lay flat on the seabed now rise diagonally across the rock face and, here and there, a sparkling band of silvery flakes is all that remains of a long-departed lake and the life it contained. The tremor we had felt the night before was merely the most recent realignment of these jostling continents.

After six hours of walking, we pass through the 7,000ft mark and arrive at Jwalabanj, our lodging for the night. I can feel the effect of the altitude now, and any activity brings on breathlessness. Happily, I have to do nothing more strenuous than sit back and watch the lights flickering on in villages across the valley. Voices float up out of the darkness, mixing with the crackling of fires and the lowing of cattle – the sound of lives unfolding quietly below.

The next morning we leave behind these rolling green foothills and head for 360 Leti, our driver picking his way around hairpin bends and weaving through the tiny Suzukis and overloaded trucks that jockey for position on the steep ascent.

As we wind our way deeper into the mountains, the traffic begins to thin and tarmac gives way to gravel and then packed earth, until we can go no further by car. We walk the last couple of miles along a dry, dusty track and are rewarded with a picture-postcard vision of the Himalayas: dark, angular peaks capped with pure white snow.

We arrive at the exalted site of 360 Leti, a forested spur of land with valleys on three sides and towering mountains beyond. Set into the hillside are four glass and stone chalets, each luxuriously appointed with Burmese teak furniture, brass fittings and copper basins. Floor-to-ceiling glass is all that stands between me and some of the world's most breathtaking scenery.





Breathtaking in both senses. Needing time to adjust to the altitude, I opt for a gentle walk to a nearby Hindu temple the next morning. On the way back, with low cloud hanging over us, Rohan expounds on the Hindu pantheon, ancient creation myths, depictions of aliens in Babylonian art and the sci-fi film 2012 – a train of thought that may have been influenced by the thinning air.

In need of sustenance, I take up the offer of a cooking masterclass with Yeshi, the head chef at Leti and a former Tibetan monk. I watch as he whips up samosas with his well-practised fingers, then take my turn under the watchful eye of the Dalai Lama, whose portrait hangs in the corner of the kitchen. A couple of hours later, my efforts take their place at my candlelit table, accompanied by Yeshi's more expert creations.

Full of the complacency that follows a good meal, I commit myself to an early rise the next morning for an attempt on Leti's most challenging trail. We will need a clear day for the strenuous trek to the peak of Khadaa Dhunga, and as we leave the warmth of the dining room, a glittering sky confirms that the cloud has indeed lifted. There is no getting out of it now.

I wake before dawn and set out on the steep, rocky path, spurred on by the sight of fresh mountain snowfalls, now brushed with gold by the rising sun. Soon Rohan and I are climbing through rhododendron forest, the flowers fading from scarlet to pale pink as we gain altitude. I fade too in the thinning air, more breathless with every step, my head throbbing from the lack of oxygen.

Stepping above the tree line, the summit is finally in sight. So too are the simple houses of the shepherds who wander the mountains with their flocks as the snowline ebbs and flows. Some homes have been abandoned and ravaged by storms, but with the snow receding, they will soon be patched up and brought back into service for another summer.

Pressing on past these outposts of an ancient way of life, and feeling rather ancient myself with my pounding heart and heaving lungs, I struggle up the final few steps to the summit. Relief gives way to triumph and then awe as the landscape unfolds in front of me.

To the north, Khadaa Dhunga plunges precipitously into a valley and then rises in a series of rolling hills and mountains, ridge after ridge, into the full splendour of the Himalayas. I am facing a natural, snow-capped amphitheatre and, directly in front of me, the twin-peaked summit of Nanda Devi. At 25,646 feet, it was once thought to be the highest in the world.

I sit down to eat with the mountains at my feet and reflect on the path behind me, leading back down to Leti and then on to the lodgings in the foothills, the sleepy railway station at Kathgodam and across the dry plains to Delhi. With my back to the city, I breathe in the crisp mountain air and tuck in to breakfast on top of the world.

Donald Trump asked Senate Republicans to introduce a healthcare bill with “more heart.” They didn’t.

The senators’ draft legislation, introduced last Thursday, will strip tens of millions of low-income and middle-class Americans of their health insurance. Millions more will face higher costs for lower coverage. The Congressional Budget office estimates 22 million more people will be uninsured by 2026 than would be if the Affordable Care Act remained law.

The Senate bill will cut the number of people eligible for subsidies that reduce monthly premiums and lower out-of-pocket costs for insurance bought on the Affordable Care Act health exchanges. It will defund Planned Parenthood for one year, which is an important source of preventive and primary care services for millions of low-income women and women of color. It strikes at the heart of healthcare services for the poor by ending Medicaid expansion in 2021 and changing the way states receive federal funding - another measure that will cause cuts in the program.

These cuts will be on top of the $600 billion that the president’s budget seeks to eliminate from the program over the next 10 years.

During his election campaign, Trump’s outreach to black voters effectively comprised the question “What do you have to lose?” That answer has become clear.

The president’s effort to repeal Obamacare, coupled with rollbacks in civil-rights enforcement and massive cuts to safety net programs, are moving the country backward. The Senate health bill is the latest in a string of efforts to dismantle programs and policies that benefit all Americans, and are especially critical in closing racial disparities in health, income, education, housing and policing.

The administration’s effort to do away with the Affordable Care Act is at the top of the list of actions that will hit people of color hardest. Although every racial and ethnic group benefited from greater access to insurance, the reduction in the uninsured rate for African Americans, Native Americans and Latinos, was near double that experienced by whites in the first year the law took effect. Much of this improvement was because of Medicaid expansion under the Obama program.

The attack on Medicaid is especially concerning given its role in providing rural and urban children and families with access to healthcare. Medicaid covers one in five Americans, including poor adults, seniors and people with disabilities. Half of all births nationwide are covered by the program.

Beyond the assault on healthcare programs, the president’s budget will cut taxes for the wealthy and increase defense spending by $54 billion while slashing programs that provide help to low-income individuals, families and communities. It will cut billions of dollars from food and nutrition, housing, and community development programs that poor families and communities rely on to meet basic living needs.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides food stamps to help working families meet their nutritional needs. Funding for the program will be reduced by more than 25 percent, or $193 billion, over 10 years. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which provides federal funding for state-based income support and work programs for poor families, would be cut by $22 billion during the same period. And the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s budget will be slashed by nearly 15 percent or $7.4 billion. At a time the nation faces an affordable housing crisis, funding for homeless programs, direct rental assistance and home-buying programs are being drastically reduced.

If Trump has his way, other programs, such as the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program that helps pay for heat and electricity, and the Community Development Block Grant program that helps revitalize economically depressed neighborhoods will be eliminated.

The environmental justice program within the Environmental Protection Agency is also slated to be shut down. Low-income communities are more likely to have poorer air and water quality and have historically been targeted for dumping of toxic pollutants. Environmental justice initiatives have been key in remedying this imbalance. The Flint water crisis was an unfortunate reminder that our communities remain vulnerable to high levels of lead and other environmental inequities that have lasting impact on health.

The closing of the environmental justice office at EPA is part of the Trump administration’s broad strategy to reduce civil rights enforcement by federal agencies. The office of civil rights within the Education Department is also targeted for cuts and a similar office in the Labor Department will be eliminated.

Then there are the efforts to roll back Obama-era criminal justice reforms. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has called for harsher sentences for low-level drug offenders - again a measure that will disproportionately affect racial minorities. Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to be charged and to receive longer sentences than whites for similar crimes regardless of prior criminal history or severity of the crime. Despite similar rates of drug use, blacks are 10 times more likely to be incarcerated for drug use compared to whites. Sessions has also signaled that his Justice Department will not enforce consent decree agreements that have played a key role in holding police departments accountable for civil rights abuses – another area in which minority communities have been disproportionately singled out.

These policies are chipping away at the nation’s health and sustainability. The U.S. will be a minority-majority nation in a few decades. It is not in our national interest to marginalize Americans of color.

US theatre companies with "Shakespeare" in their names say they have been targeted with abusive and threatening messages following right-wing outrage over a New York production of Julius Caesar.

The Washington Post reports that the Massachusetts-based Shakespeare & Company was sent a letter saying: "F*** you, hope you all who did this play about Trump are the first do die when ISIS COMES TO YOU f****** sumbags," while the Boston Globe says Shakespeare Dallas in Texas has received more than 80 misdirected abusive messages, including threats of rape and death along with the suggestion that the company be "sent to Isis to be killed with real knives".

Raphael Parry, artistic director at Shakespeare Dallas, told the newspaper he blamed Google’s analytics for prioritising local search results for theatres.

"They’re just doing a general Google search," he said. "When you Google 'Shakespeare in the Park' in the Texas region, our name pops up first, and they just go to town."

Anger among Trump supporters has grown following his depiction as Julius Caesar in the annual Shakespeare in the Park in New York.

The production references contemporary politics, imagining Caesar as a Trump-like figure complete with a Slavic-accented wife.

Right-wing media sites have reacted angrily to the depiction. A headline in Breitbart read: "'Trump' Stabbed to Death in Central Park Performance of Julius Caesar", while Fox News Insider titled its article: "NYC Play Appears to Depict Assassination of Trump."

A recent performance was disrupted by two protesters who objected to the bloody scene in which the title character is knifed to death, reports the New York Times.

The outcry has also led several sponsors, including Delta Airlines, to withdraw their support from the production.

Trump-like Julius Caesar: Five facts about controversial New York production

12 June

A new production of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar in New York has come under attack for its portrayal of a Donald Trump-like character in the title role of the doomed Roman leader.

In the show, staged by the non-profit Public Theatre for the regular free summer Shakespeare in the Park event, Gregg Henry plays Caesar as an obnoxious, blond-haired businessman who is stabbed to death by his fellow senators because they fear his hunger for power.

The interpretation has led to two major US corporations boycotting the production.

Here's what you need to know.

Caesar really does look like Trump

This isn't a case of mistaken identity - Henry's Caesar does resemble the US President - in fact, the New York Times review says the "depiction of a petulant, blondish Caesar in a blue suit, complete with gold bathtub and a pouty Slavic wife, takes onstage Trump-trolling to a startling new level".

Does it go too far?

According to reports, audiences have been shocked when Caesar is stabbed, but it is mostly conservative commentators who have expressed outrage over the show.

A Breitbart article headlined: "'Trump' Stabbed to Death in Central Park Performance of 'Julius Caesar'" quotes audience member Laura Schaeffer saying she found the show "shocking and distasteful". Meanwhile, in Fox Insider, Fox & Friends hosts said it was "not a subtle statement" to portray the murder of a US president.

Donald Trump Jr has also questioned funding for the show:

I wonder how much of this "art" is funded by taxpayers? Serious question, when does "art" become political speech & does that change things? https://t.co/JfOmLLBJCn — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 11, 2017

Delta and Bank of America have withdrawn support

Two major sponsors, Delta Air Lines and Bank of America, have withdrawn their sponsorship of the production, with the BBC reporting that Delta had said the producers had "crossed the line on the standards of good taste". Both companies have been supportive of Shakespeare in the Park for the past several years.

Not everyone hates the show

According to the production's leading actor, Julius Caesar contains important parallels to today's political environment.

In an interview with Backstage, Henry said director Oskar Eustis's vision was "very much to show us a warning that Shakespeare had" and that the play was about "the way you fight that tyrant". Eustis himself, in a statement to the Associated Press said "anyone seeing our production of 'Julius Caesar' will realise it in no way advocates violence towards anyone".

A string of violent Trump parodies

There has been a series of controversies over Trump parodies with violent overtones over the last few weeks. Comedian Kathy Griffin was fired by CNN after appearing to hold up a severed Trump head, while the Daily Telegraph reports that rap star Snoop Dogg shot a clown dressed like the President in a video, prompting an angry tweet from Trump criticising the rapper's "failing career" and asking what the response would have been if he had pretended to shoot Barack Obama.

Entertainment Weekly, however, says this isn't the first time Julius Caesar has drawn on the White House for inspiration. In 2012, a version by New York-based The Acting Company featured an Obama-like version of the Roman leader.

Northern Ireland's politicians have missed multiple deadlines to restore power-sharing at Stormont since March, with each party blaming the other - and the Tory minority government - for the most recent failure to meet an agreement.

While DUP leader Arlene Foster says talks will continue over the summer, negotiators remain far apart on several issues, including Sinn Fein's demands for an Irish language act.

What's behind the rift?

Michelle O'Neill, Sinn Fein's leader at Stormont, claims the Conservatives' deal with the DUP is one of the main reasons efforts to establish a new administration have floundered, the Belfast Telegraph reports.

"What this constitutes is a monumental failure on behalf of Theresa May," she said on Tuesday. "She has set back decades of work that has been done here throughout the years and it's a consequence, as we all know, of the DUP supporting the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister in turn supporting the DUP."

Calls for an Irish language act

The DUP, meanwhile, blames the stalemate on Sinn Fein's demands for an Irish language act to put Irish on an equal par with English in the province.

Fearing criticism from hardline unionists, the party has argued for an all-embracing culture act that would also guarantee the rights of Ulster Scots speakers and incorporate the protection of Orange/Protestant culture into legislation, The Guardian reports.

What now?

The government has repeatedly warned that if no power-sharing deal is in place soon, it may call for new elections or step in to govern the region through direct rule.

Both the UK and Irish governments have warned that failing to secure an agreement would have "profound and serious implications" and limit Northern Ireland's influence in Brexit talks, Reuters says.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley says, ''If we act together we can still prevent a catastrophe and we can rid the world of a grave threat,'' in response to Pyongyang's recent intercontinental ballistic missile launch. Rough Cut (no reporter narration).

ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) STORY: U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Wednesday (July 5) that North Korea's actions were "quickly closing off the possibility of a diplomatic solution" and the United States was prepared to defend itself and its allies. "One of our capabilities lies with our considerable military forces. We will use them if we must, but we prefer not to have to go in that direction," Haley told a U.N. Security Council meeting on Pyongyang's recent intercontinental ballistic missile launch. She said the United States would propose new U.N. sanctions on North Korea "in the coming days." She also warned that Washington was prepared to cut off trade with countries trading with North Korea in violation of U.N. resolutions.

Fans of University Challenge have said Cambridge scholar Eric Monkman remains their unlikely hero, despite being branded “useless” by host Jeremy Paxman as his team lost out in the final.

The Canadian captain of Wolfson College, Cambridge, has sent social media into a frenzy this series, with fans going into meltdown over his hotly anticipated head-to-head with Oxford’s Joey Goldman, who also gained a cult following this season.

‘Monkmania’ peaked this evening as Wolfson locked horns with Oxford’s Balliol, showcasing the 29-year-old Economic's graduate's distinctive facial expressions and vigorously determined approach to answering the difficult questions.

Despite his best efforts, he could do little to prevent a comfortable win with a 50-point margin by the Oxford four.

The Canadian made heroic efforts, nailing the starter questions time and again, but Balliol were much the stronger team and pulled away in the final stretch of the half-hour BBC2 show to win by 190 points to 140.

When the Cambridge student stumbled as he made a guess midway through the show, host Mr Paxman snorted with his trademark disdain: “That was a completely useless answer", this served only to endear Monkman further to his fans, especially when he self-deprecatingly agreed with the host.

Be proud Monkman, you may have lost a final but you won a nations heart. #monkmania #UniversityChallenge — Nathaniel Marten (@altr_nate85) April 10, 2017

Balliol captain Joey Goldman didn't lead from the front quite in the manner of Monkman but was ultimately more effective with a stronger supporting team.

Monkman led enthusiastic applause for the victors, who were were awarded the coveted trophy by Professor Stephen Hawking, who gave a light-hearted speech.

what an honour for Stephen Hawking to get to meet Monkman #Monkmania #UniversityChallenge — Holly Morgan-Davies (@hmdavies95) April 10, 2017

“I have said in the past that it is not clear whether intelligence has any long term survival value. Bacteria manage to flourish without it. But it is one of the most admirable qualities, especially when displayed by such young minds. Many congratulations to both teams and especially to Balliol College, Oxford on becoming series champions on University Challenge, a programme I have long enjoyed.”

Monkman, who is currently job hunting in his hometown of Oakville after completing his Master's degree, said he finds his newfound cult celebrity status "a bit strange."

Fans may be disappointed to learn he has a girlfriend, Jiang Na, a professor of law at Beijing Normal University. He told The Daily Telegraph that he doesn't think of himself as "an object of desire" and assumes people are being ironic when they suggest he is a sex symbol on Twitter.

First reviews are out on Mercedes's Porsche 911 GT3 RS-rivalling AMG GT R earlier this year and the critics seem impressed.

Mercedes has designed the AMG GT R to perform at Germany's famous racing circuit - the Nurburgring. Setting a lap time of seven minutes and ten seconds, it broke the record for the fastest rear-wheel drive production car while using a standard set of Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tyres.

Video of Beast of the Green Hell: The Mercedes-AMG GT R – Mercedes-Benz original

Here are all the details and what the experts think.

Design

The stripped-out supercar, inspired by the marque's GT3 racer, has a noticeably wider track and several carbon fibre additions compared to its entry-level GT relative. The wider body not only improves handling by increasing the car's surface area, it also allows for better airflow to the brakes and around the vehicle.

Carbon-fibre active aerodynamic devices are fitted under the body, which moves downwards above 50mph to create what Mercedes calls a "Venturi effect" sucking the car to the ground and providing more high-speed grip. Air is also fed towards the rear diffuser, which improves stability on circuits and provides an increase in cornering speeds.

Underneath, the GT R features bigger brakes than its predecessor, adjustable suspension and a four-wheel steering system making it more agile at low speeds, when the rear section turns in the opposite direction to the front, and more stable when going fast by pointing both sets in the same direction.

Performance

The AMG GT R uses an uprated version of the 4.0-litre V8 bi-turbo from the standard GT, producing an extra 74bhp and 37lb-ft torque for an output of 577bhp and 516lb-ft torque. This surge in power is helped by the two uprated turbocharges that sit inside the engine in Mercedes's "hot vee" layout - a similar technique to that seen in its F1 cars.

The engine is paired to a seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox, which helps direct the power towards the rear wheels. It also features a nine-stage traction control system from the GT3 racing car, with level one tailored for wet conditions and level nine allowing for the most wheel spin.

Factor in the lighter kerb weight of 3594lbs and the GT R goes from zero to 62mph in 3.6secs, with a top speed of 196mph. Economy figures are what you would expect from a track-focused machine, with Auto Express reporting a claimed 24.8mpg and 259g/km of CO2 emissions.

Reviews

Traction, balance and grip levels are "truly impressive" in the hardcore Mercedes coupe, says Evo. While the steering feels a little lighter than expected, there's a "genuine sense of connection to the R's front end".

Switching the 11-stage traction control system completely off reveals "even greater ability", adds the magazine. Unlike previous range-topping AMG models, the GT R "finds so much grip on the way into corners" and lots of traction on the exit, making it a very rewarding experience for drivers.

The AMG GT R's vocal V8 engine is enjoyable in "short blasts", but it could become "a little wearing" on long journeys, says the Daily Telegraph. The same can be said for the suspension, which feels "firm" and might not be comfortable on worn British roads.

Nevertheless, it's a car of "immense ability and considerable charm", the newspaper says. It's a "treat for the eye and ear", offering a challenging driving experience that is "no longer disconcerting".

The AMG GT R was tuned at Germany's famous Nurburgring track to make it the fastest supercar on the market, but its "super-sticky" Michelin tyres help " get its power down surprisingly well" and stop it being "intimidating", The Independent says

The tyres, along with "extra width between the wheels", means the GT R is "more poised" through corners than the regular GT, while rear-wheel steering and active aerodynamics also improve handling at higher speeds.

Rivals such as the McLaren 540C and Audi R8 will "steer more sweetly" through bends, says the Independent, but "there isn’t much that can beat it" in high speed corners.

"It's surprisingly easy to live with," says What Car?, although it warns buyers will need time to adjust to the "ridiculously long bonnet and the fiddly infotainment system".

The interior, however, "looks suitably special" and there's "lots of manmade suede and gloss black trim", while a yellow dial in the centre of the dashboard allows drivers to "vary the interference from the stability control system".

Those in the market for a car "to make you feel good and other people jealous" won't find much better than an AMG GT R, concludes What Car?.

Rivals

As a track-focused supercar with a £140,000 price tag, the AMG GT R is a direct competitor to the Porsche 911 GT3 RS.

The 911 GT3 RS is powered by a 3.8-litre naturally aspirated flat-six engine, which produces 493bhp and revs to a radical 8,250rpm. The AMG GT R, however, produces over 80bhp more than the Porsche from its 4.0-litre bi-turbo V8 – revving to 6,250rpm.

While the Porsche may lack the overall horsepower of the Mercedes, it's around 400lbs lighter than the GT R's 3,594lbs kerb weight.

When it launched in 2015, the 911 GT3 RS cost around £10,000 less than the AMG GT R, which Evo says makes it "something of a bargain". But the GT3 RS "sold out in double-quick time", which means buyers will need to look to private sellers to get their hands on one.

Other rivals to consider are Jaguar's 576bhp F-Type SVR and the V10-engined Audi R8 Plus. Buyers may also want to consider Lamborghini's Huracan Performante, although it's the GT R's most expensive rival at £215,000.

Prices

The AMG GT R is available to order now, with prices starting at £143,245. The optional Nurburgring-inspired "green hell magno" paint costs £7,500, with ceramic brakes priced at £5,995.

Further education advocate Shakira Martin has won the National Union of Students presidential election for 2017.

Following a strongly contested campaign, Ms Martin, 28, was elected with 56 per cent of the student vote, beating Tom Harwood and last year’s controversial winner Malia Bouattia.

Defining herself as a black single mother from a working-class family, Ms Martin said further education had been a “lifeline” for her and her family.

Speaking to The Independent before the results were announced, Ms Martin said she had been inspired to run in the election after speaking to students who said they felt increasingly disenfranchised and disconnected from the union.

“I want to put the NUS back into the hands of its membership and send the message to the heart of the government about what students want,” she said.

Formerly the vice president for further education (FE), Ms Martin has pledged to “expose and demolish class barriers to education” and ensure FE students are better represented in the NUS.

Approximately 4.1 million members of the union are in college or further education rather than universities – a fact she says is all too often ignored.

Following the announcement of her victory, she said: “I am honoured and humbled to have been elected as NUS national president.

“I take this as a vote of trust that our members believe I can lead our national movement to be the fighting and campaigning organisation we need it to be, representing the breadth of our diverse membership.

“Further education made me who I am today and I look forward to sharing stories of just how powerful all forms of education can be when we’re all given access to it. During my term in office I want to spend my time listening, learning and leading.”

Drawing on her own experiences as a single mother entering education, Ms Martin said she chose to focus her campaign on the difference education and student unions could make to individuals.

“Over the past couple of years, I’ve spoken to so many students across the country who have said that the NUS is out of touch with its members and out of touch with students and not fighting for the issues that students care about,” she told The Independent.

Her comments come in the wake of Malia Bouattia’s controversial leadership which saw student unions across the country become increasingly divided.

Malia Bouattia interview

Ms Bouattia faced damning criticism and a parliament-led investigation last year after she was accused of anti-Semitism by the Jewish student community.

The then leader denied the allegations, criticising media outlets for calling her “a racist, an anti-Semite, an Isis sympathiser, and more”.

The House of Commons home affairs committee concluded that comments made by Ms Bouattia describing Birmingham University as a “Zionist outpost” smacked of “outright racism”.

In an interview with The Independent during the run-up to Wednesday’s vote, Ms Bouattia said she recognised the comments from six years ago were “incredibly clumsy” and said she hoped students would recognise her more recent work fighting hate-crime within the student community.

As its first Muslim female president, the NUS said it “applauds” Ms Bouattia’s work to make the movement “more diverse, ensuring the organisation is representative of the students it represents”.

Tom harwood – NUs delegate campaign video

Ms Bouattia received 272 votes from the 721 delegates – 130 fewer than Ms Martin. Satirical video campaigner Tom Harwood was the least successful, coming away with just 35 votes.

His sharp rise to fame followed claims he could “defeat Isis” and lower the cost of Freddos in his initial NUS delegate campaign.

Mr Harwood, a 20-year-old politics student at the University of Durham, led his presidential campaign with the promise he would work to reunite the student union, which he said was “in crisis” and had been “hijacked” by the left.

He had previously run the “Students for Britain” campaign during the EU referendum, encouraging students to vote for Brexit.

Speaking to The Independent before the NUS conference he said: “The NUS has failed in including students in the movement. Nationwide, turnouts in NUS delegate elections are pitifully low, it is common for turnouts to be below 5 per cent. This is not good enough.”

“It seems that every week there’s a new anti-Semitism scandal,” he added, “and the current leadership of NUS is refusing to change. Intimidation is rife, and the hard factional politics push students away.”

Over 1,200 students, elected officers and campaigners from higher and further education, including apprentices, from across the UK are spending this week in Brighton to debate and decide on key policy issues affecting students.

Last year a number of student unions across the country voted to disafilliate with the NUS, including the universities of Cambridge, Lincoln and Loughborough.

Private not state hackers likely to have targeted UK parliament - sources

LONDON A cyber attack on email accounts of British lawmakers last month is likely to have been by amateur or private hackers rather than state-sponsored, European government sources said.

You & Mr Jones, the “brand tech” firm founded by former Havas CEO David Jones, is continuing its investment and hiring spree.

The New York-based company was launched in June 2015 with a $350 million investment to help it acquire and invest in companies that specialize in areas such as content creation, brand and content strategy, social-media marketing, data and analytics, programmatic media buying, and multichannel networks.

In the two years since it was founded, You & Mr Jones hasn’t slowed down on the deal front.

Recent, previously unannounced investments have included Tribe Dynamics, an influencer data platform that ties “earned media”—press coverage or other content placements that weren’t paid for by the advertiser—to sales. The firm also has backed Elsy, which uses artificial intelligence for media planning. Financial terms weren’t disclosed for either transaction.

The average strategic venture investment You & Mr Jones tends to make in a company—which previously has included the likes of digital media news and culture site Mashable and Pokémon Go maker Niantic—tends to be around $2 million. But it has invested anywhere from $100,000 to $6 million so far, according to Mr. Jones. On the majority acquisition side, total deal sizes, some of which are based on future performance, have reached from $30 million to just over $100 million.

Overall, You & Mr Jones has invested in 13 companies, acquired majority stakes in four firms and launched two of its own startups.

As for the future, Mr. Jones anticipates the company will be making more acquisitions in the data and analytics space, mobile video and “people-powered” marketing solutions that allow brands to tap into a crowd of talent to create their content. Mr. Jones expects the company also will make more minority investments in companies that work in the areas of augmented reality and virtual reality.

Mr. Jones said his company has four criteria it looks for in a potential investment or acquisition: “Is it a great business in a vertical we want to play in? Do we like the people? Will brands get excited about this? Can we do a deal at a valuation that makes sense?”

Ron Croen, partner at You & Mr Jones Photo: You & Mr Jones

Over the past year, the company has added a number of new partners to its team. Hires include Ron Croen, the founder and former CEO of technology company Nuance Communications; Julie Hardy, the former director at digital agency DAN Paris; and Amy Luca, who came on board in June as president of theAmplify, an influencer marketing platform You & Mr Jones acquired a majority stake in last year.

As a private company, Mr. Jones declined to provide financial information. But he did say that the company has more than $150 million of its initial investment left and that revenue grew 724% last year, albeit from a small, unspecified base.

You & Mr Jones has counted brands including Coca-Cola, Google, BNP Paribas, Facebook and Unilever among its clients.

While Mr. Jones comes from an ad agency background, he says he is “in no way, in any shape or form, looking to compete with or do what a WPP” does.

“Airbnb didn’t launch going, ‘We are going to launch a new Hyatt,” Mr. Jones said. “Uber didn’t go, ‘Yellow cabs, we are going to put them out of business.’ It’s a similar parallel. What we are setting out to do is create a new [brand tech] category.”

You & Mr Jones works with brands, but it has a couple of key differences from the way ad agencies work. The company doesn’t want to be on an agency roster and would rather be paid on a project-by-project basis, Mr. Jones said, adding that You & Mr Jones tends to find itself more in competition with management consultancies than ad agencies.

History students at the University of Oxford will be required to sit at least one exam paper focusing on black, Asian and other non-European history, following long-held complaints about an overly “white” curriculum.

From the next academic year, all Oxford history undergraduate students will choose at least one from a range of papers covering non-British and non-European areas of interest during their three-year degree course.

The move comes as universities across the UK face protests led by the student campaign, Why is my curriculum white?, The Times reported.

Possible topics for students to choose from include the 1960s civil rights movement in the US, Indian independence, the Spanish conquest of Mexico and te development of modern Japan. Figures such as Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and Mahatma Gandhi will feature prominently.

The top ranking UK institution has been criticised in recent years for not recruiting enough black students, despite a growing number of BAME students applying.

The university has also been at the centre of controversy following the student-led Rhodes Must Fall campaign, which saw thousands of people across the UK and South Africa campaign for statues of Cecil Rhodes to be removed on the basis that he was a “racist colonialist”.

Oxford’s Oriel College, which is home to one Cecil Rhodes figure, has since refused to take it down.

An Oxford University spokesman said there was “no link” between the Rhodes Must Fall campaign and the updated history curriculum – the move was in fact four years in the making, he said.

You do not have access to view this Atom.

In a statement, the university’s History Faculty said the department “regularly reviews and updates its course curriculum to reflect the latest developments in the subject.

“After a number of years of discussion and consultation among ourselves and with students, we have decided to make a number of changes to the curriculum.

“Among these is a requirement that students study one paper (from a wide range of such options) in non-British and non-European history, alongside two papers of British History and two papers of European History.”

Students take eleven papers in total during their history degree, the faculty added, and many members already opt to take at least one paper of non-European or British history.

“We are pleased to be modernising and diversifying our curriculum in this way,” the department said.

Film student makes emotional Adidas advert that's gone viral

The move has been welcomed by students and academics alike, but critics have argued the change does little to solve Oxford’s underrepresentation of women and ethnic minorities.

Niall Ferguson, a former Oxford professor who is now at the Hoover Institution in America, told The Times: “By comparison with America, some history courses here do look a bit old-fashioned.

“I am not the kind of backwoodsman who thinks Oxford should only teach English history and general history, which is what it did when I was an undergraduate, but let us be careful not to stop teaching crucial subjects like the rise of the West or the world wars in the effort to make courses more diverse.”

This year, the institution unveiled a series of new portraits of women and non-white scholars and alumni in a bid to “redress diversity” on show.

Other universities are also in the process of reviewing their history curriculums, it was reported, including Leeds, where a module in Black British History is said to be in development.

Cambridge professor Sir Richard Evans also said the way the empire was being taught was changing. “It is being studied in a more balanced way,” he said.

* This article originally reported that Oxford University was to introduce a "new exam paper" featuring black, Middle Eastern, Asian and Indian events, which was to be taken by all history undergraduates. In fact, as the quoted comments from Oxford University made clear, the change to the curriculum simply makes it a requirement that all history students take at least one non-European paper from a range of options during their degree. Some of the options have been available for many years. 6/6/17

Michael Palin has made his own unique contribution to the cultural riches housed at the British Library, donating more than 50 notebooks "containing original drafts, fledging ideas and personal reflections relating to his Monty Python writing", reports the BBC.

It is a collection that dates back to 1965, four years before the cult comedy first aired. As well as the writer and actor's personal diaries from the period, which are more extensive than his published memoirs, the documents also reveal the pay rates the Python team received from the BBC - Palin got 12 guineas, while co-star Graham Chapman was only paid ten.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Palin said the "doodles, notes and scribbles" could give fans an insight into how the Python team worked.

He said: "People ask me so often, 'How did you start Monty Python?', 'How do you get into writing?' There's no better way than actually looking at the material, the way we did it, and you can see it all here."

He added he had felt "a bit shy" about putting his notes on display, but said it would mean "future generations will know not to make the same mistakes".

The British Library adopts a slightly different stance, saying the "comedy talent of tomorrow may find inspiration from this collection”.

Palin's "contribution to comedy, film and television over the past 50 years has been enormous", it added, and Monty Python had "an unparalleled influence on British comedy and internationally".

The collection will be available to view in the British Library Reading Rooms from spring 2018.

The Fringe is the largest performing arts festival in the world, but the first festival in 1947 relied on more humble support PA

As Edinburgh prepares to host the largest arts event in the world, an archive has shown that the inaugural festival in 1947 only went ahead thanks to the generosity and spirit of residents.

The Edinburgh International Festival’s new site to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the event and its fringe offshoot recalls how 6,000 homeowners offered rooms for guests after a plea from Lord Provost John Falconer, because hotels had not yet been re-requisitioned after the Second World War.

Residents helped to overturn a ban on the castle being lit up by donating their coal rations, and helped to dress the city with flowers and flags.

Volunteers manned a club at the Assembly Rooms, preparing 2,500 meals a day for visitors, while the festival liaised…

Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE A new USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll shows low support among Americans for the GOP healthcare bill. Susan Page, USA TODAY Washington bureau chief, explains the findings. USA TODAY

Just 12% of Americans support the Senate Republican health care plan, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds, amid a roiling debate over whether the GOP will deliver on its signature promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.

In the survey, taken Saturday through Tuesday, a 53% majority say Congress should either leave the law known as Obamacare alone or work to fix its problems while keeping its framework intact.

But the dilemma for the GOP is this: Eight in 10 Republicans support repeal, and close to a third say the law should be repealed even if a replacement health care plan isn't ready yet. Just 11% of independents and 2% of Democrats feel that way.

The divide between the demands of the GOP base and the skepticism of the broader electorate helps explain why Senate Republican leaders have been forced to delay a vote as they scramble for the 50 votes needed to pass a measure.

Donald Jones, 61, a sheriff from West Frankfort, Ill., who was among those called in the survey, has seen both the benefits and costs of Obamacare. "I had one relative who probably was uninsurable and was able to get insurance that they wouldn't have been able to get otherwise," he said in a follow-up interview. "I had another family member who was forced to get insurance that they really can't afford to pay."

Now, he doesn't think Congress should repeal it and he objects to the Senate rush to a vote: "It has kept people from knowing enough about it."

In the survey, 45% oppose the Senate bill and nearly as many, 40%, say they don't know enough about it to have an opinion. The plan was drafted in closed sessions by a handful of Republican senators and staffers, and it hasn't gone through the customary process of committee hearings.

Even among Republicans, only 26% support the Senate bill; 17% oppose it. A 52% majority say they need more information before they can express a view.

Robert Ridge, 76, a retiree from Hazel Green, Ala., has some qualms about the lack of a public debate on the Senate bill, but he endorses the GOP's goal. "We need changes to Obamacare; it's imploding," he says. "If it solves the severe problems that Obamacare has, it would certainly be an improvement."

The poll of 1,000 registered voters, taken by landline and cellphone, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

Whatever the political disagreements, there is an overwhelming national consensus on what provisions any health care plan should include:

Pre-existing conditions: More than three-fourths, 77%, say it is "very important" that the health care system permit people with pre-existing medical conditions to buy health insurance at the same price as others. Just 6% say that protection isn't important to them. The Senate bill requires insurers to accept those with pre-existing conditions, but it allows states to seek permission to reduce required benefits. Some patients could face dramatically higher costs or lifetime limits for treatments no longer defined as essential.

Some patients could face dramatically higher costs or lifetime limits for treatments no longer defined as essential. Medicaid expansion: Nearly two-thirds, 63%, say it is "very important" that lower-income people who became eligible for Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act continued to be covered by Medicaid. Just 10% say that isn't important to them. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Senate plan, which would cut Medicaid spending by $772 billion over the next 10 years, would result in 15 million fewer people being covered.

Lower premiums: Close to six in 10, 57%, say it is "very important" that insurance premiums go down in price; 17% say that's not important. The CBO predicts that premiums would rise for a few years under the Senate plan, then fall by about 30%. But overall health care costs would go up for most people because deductibles would be higher and some states wouldn't require insurers to provide some benefits that are now mandated.

"There are a whole lot of benefits to Obamacare, like the birth control (coverage), like not making women pay more for insurance, the supplement to those who cannot afford Medicaid, coverage of pre-existing conditions," says Melinda Mckonly, 67, a retired pastor from Manheim, Pa. "There are just a big list of things that help people."

By more than 4-1, those surveyed trust congressional Democrats over congressional Republicans to protect the interests of them and their families on health care, 43%-10%. Another 19% say they trust President Trump most. The president's ratings on handling health care far lags his standing on other issues, including the economy and national security.

Apparently, Britain has a housing crisis. Here’s what it looks like: first-half operating margins “comfortably” ahead of the 25.7 per cent achieved in the second half of last year; cash returns to shareholders of £2.85 billion by the end of 2021; and, by the same date, a potential £600 million bonus for the top 150 executives.

Yes, it’s mean to pick on Persimmon, Britain’s biggest housebuilder. It’s just produced a first-half trading update that it justifiably calls “excellent”: revenues up 12 per cent to £1.66 billion, lifted by about half the customers using Help to Buy; forward sales 18 per cent higher at £1.6 billion; and average selling prices 3.5 per cent ahead at £213,000. It’s building more houses, too, with completions up 8 per…

Lexus has kicked off proceedings at the New York Motor Show by unveiling its high-performance LS 500 F Sport.

Based on this year's LS luxury saloon, the F Sport will be powered by a new twin-turbocharged 3.5-litre V6 engine that produces 409bhp and 442lb-ft of torque. The motor is coupled to a ten-speed automatic gearbox, allowing the F Sport to go from zero to 60mph in 4.5secs.

It will also be available in plugin-hybrid LS 500h form, says AutoExpress, which uses a 349bhp 3.5-litre V6 and two electric motors. Hybrid models come paired with a four-speed automatic gearbox that can mimic a ten-speed transmission in manual mode for a more engaging driving experience.

Lexus will equip all variants of the F Sport with its "Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management chassis control system", which the magazine says alters the characteristics of the chassis and power management.

Inside, the F Sport benefits from redesigned front seats and "aluminium trim elements", says Evo. It also has a sports steering wheel and "a different look to the digital instruments that takes inspiration from one of the first cars to boast such technology – the LFA supercar".

Exterior tweaks include "a more aggressive interpretation of the company's now-familiar spindle grille", the magazine says, which has been coated in a black paint and incorporates "7000 individual facets in its mesh-like structure".

Prices for the LS 500 F Sport have yet to be released, but expect it to cost more than the existing model's £99,995 price tag.

The New York Motor Show runs from 14 to 23 April.

Lexus to debut high-performance LS F Sport at New York

5 April

Lexus is gearing-up to unveil a high-performance variant of its LS 500 saloon at the New York Motor Show this month.

Dubbed the LS 500 F Sport, the long-wheelbase executive saloon will be built on the entry-level's GA-L platform, which is also the foundation of the company's LC 500 sports car due to reach the market this year.

The F Sport will "inherit the same 409bhp 3.5-litre twin-turbo V6 petrol or 345bhp V6 hybrid engine options as the standard cars", says Evo, while the stiffer architecture of the base model should maintain "the exceptional ride comfort one would expect from a high end Lexus".

According to AutoExpress, much like other F Sport models in the range, the high-performance LS 500 "will cut a more aggressive, sportier look than other cars in the LS range with new alloy wheels and more muscular bodywork".

It could also continue the performance theme inside, adds the magazine, "with sports seats and new eye-catching new instrumentation behind a sports steering wheel".

While it won't rival saloons with "stonking" performance, says Cnet, "it should stand on its own as the most fun LS model yet unveiled."

There's no details on prices or performance figures yet, but Lexus will confirm specifications when the LS 500 F Sport debuts at the New York Motor Show, which runs from 14 to 23 April.

Lexus 2017 LS: Prices, specs and release date

16 January

Lexus has taken the wraps off its rival to the Mercedes S-Class saloon and BMW 7-Series, the Lexus LS, at the Detroit Motor Show.

Along with a brand new design featuring an intricate new grille, the flagship comes with an array of driving technology, including an autonomous emergency brake and automatic steering that can avoid pedestrians who stray into the road.

The interior has also been significantly redesigned, with a host of wood panelling and metal highlights giving a more premium feel. Buyers will also be able to monitor the car in several ways thanks to a 12ins display and digital dashboard.

Here are all the details.

Design

Outside, Lexus has introduced a radical new design to the LS incorporating a highly detailed grille comprising of "thousands of individual surfaces", it says. The car also features a coupe silhouette, similar to the Porsche Panamera, which is particularly noticeable in the sloping rear window.

Offered only in long-wheelbase form, the 2017 LS is lower, wider and longer than the outgoing model, offering more room inside and improving the handling dynamics. Buyers who find the ride height too low can equip an optional air-suspension pack that raises the vehicle when the doors are opened.

The cabin appears to incorporate several design queues from German rivals, including a long and sleek dashboard from the Mercedes S-Class and the BMW 7-Series steering wheel from a. As well as the plentiful supply of wood and leather Lexus owners expect, there is also a 12.3ins screen display located above the centre console and a digital dashboard.

Performance

At the heart of the saloon is a bespoke 3.5-litre twin-turbo V6 engine which delivers around 415bhp and 445lb-ft of torque to the rear-wheels. It is coupled to a ten-speed automatic gearbox, which powers the all-wheel drive model to 0-62mph in 4.5secs.

Underneath, the LS is built around Lexus's GA-L lightweight architecture, which the Japanese firm also used for its LC500 GT car. There are also stiff aluminium suspension towers and special braces in the engine compartment, stiffening the car and providing better feedback between the wheels and the driver.

Additionally, Lexus has introduced a new multilink suspension system, says AutoExpress, designed to "introduce a more precise steering response" and to optimise "ride comfort and traction", with rear-wheel steering providing "greater stability and agility".

Prices and release

Prices have not yet been revealed, but expect the 2017 LS to cost more than the current model's £99,995. Sales will begin towards the end of 2017, says CarBuyer, although orders may open earlier in the year.

The U.S. government sought to intervene in Apple's tax troubles in Europe, a source told Reuters. Last August, the European Commission said Apple had received illegal tax breaks in Ireland, and it ordered the company to pay back close to $15 billion. The decision was criticized by the Obama administration. Trump's White House has not said anything in public about the case. In December, Apple appealed the EC decision in the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second-highest. This is where the U.S. government filed its application to intervene in the case. The court is expected to hear the case in late 2018. Apple is not the only U. S. company in the EU crosshairs over tax deals. Others include Amazon, McDonald's, and Starbucks.

Brian O’Driscoll, Enda Kenny, and Dick Spring promoted Ireland’s bid to host the cup at an event last November BRIAN LAWLESS/PA

Shane Ross has defended the government’s decision to underwrite the tournament fee and basic budget for Ireland’s campaign to host the Rugby World Cup in 2023.

Controversy erupted over the €320 million bill after Eamon Ryan, the Green Party leader, claimed no risk analysis had been carried out.

“We should not commit €320 million of public money without any proper analysis as to where it’s going, what the risks are and what the potential benefits are,” Mr Ryan said yesterday.

Emergency legislation, set to be passed before the summer recess, came before the Dáil last night.

“This is the most energising piece of legislation I have introduced to this House,” Mr Ross, the sports minister, said.

She died some 1,700 years ago, and is believed to have ruled over a desert valley in ancient Peru. But a glimpse of the former priestess, the Lady of Cao, can now be seen in a replica of her face. Using modern technology, the replica was based on the Lady of Cao's skull structure and took 10 months to create. Culture Minister Salvador del Solar said the project's goal is to bring the world closer to one of Peru's best archaeological finds and remind Peruvians of their rich cultural heritage. SOUNDBITE: Salvador del Solar, Peru's culture minister, saying (English): "Today I want to share all the enthusiasm and pride with the people who have reconstructed the image of the Lady of Cao. We can now show the world her face, a face that Peruvians see ourselves in." The discovery of the Lady of Cao's mummified remains in 2005 shattered the belief that the ancient Moche society was patriarchal. Several Moche female mummies have been found since in graves with objects denoting a high political and religious standing. The Lady of Cao is a reminder of the complex societies that thrived in what is now Peru, long before the Inca empire dominated the Andes or Europeans arrived in the Americas.

National Public Radio (NPR) tweeted the Declaration of Independence line by line for the 4 July holiday and Donald Trump's supporters were not impressed.

NPR meant the series of more than a 100 tweets as a celebration of the founding document of the country and did it to honour of a 29-year tradition of reading the Declaration on air.

Some saw the tweets as particularly relevant to the state of current affairs and praised the action as a reminder of why federal funding for the public broadcaster should not be cut, as the Trump administration has proposed.

The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, — NPR (@NPR) July 4, 2017

However, the tweets drew the ire of several more people; some tweeting that NPR was inciting violence and revolution against Mr Trump.

Some were short and to the point, though misspelt:

Horsechit — Terry (@xebec78) July 4, 2017

And some were deleted after people realised their mistake, but were still documented by writer and Twitter user Parker Molloy:

More than a few people thought the tweets were justification for the broadcaster to lose funding and called the tweets "trash".

Seriously, this is the dumbest idea I have ever seen on twitter. Literally no one is going to read 5000 tweets about this trash. — Darren Mills 🇺🇸 (@darren_mills) July 4, 2017

This is spam I get alerts for NPR tweets because they are important My device is alarming nonstop. unfollowing. — Brandon Travan (@btravan_IT) July 4, 2017

At least one person recognised his "stupid" moment, however, after ironically tweeting that NPR was calling for a "revolution" and makes a good point about the Declaration of Independence.

Whisper it. It's just a few weeks until the big getaway - the one you've been saving for and dreaming about for months. You can almost hear the surf hitting the beach. It's time to escape it all with the people you love. What could possibly go wrong?

But while we’re forking out an average of £2,000 for a family of four each time, more than one in five of us don’t take out travel insurance at all, despite the astronomical bill that could add to the spend if you have problems.

Why do I need travel insurance?

A travel insurance policy usually provides cover for cancellations and delays, medical expenses if you have to visit a doctor or hospital overseas, personal liability if you cause damage to people or things, protection if your bags or possessions are stolen, lost or damaged and the really expensive one – emergency assistance or repatriation if you have to be brought back to the UK after an injury.

And they’re worth it.

The average medical claim on a travel policy comes in at almost £1,000. Worse - die abroad and the repatriation process could come in at as much as £17,000. And yet policies start at less than £5 for an individual and £17 for a family.

Not only that but buying your policy in plenty of time (most of us don’t) will cover you if the trip is cancelled by the companies involved or by you in certain cases, such as traveller illness or even the sudden death of a close relative.

European travel

What many people don’t realise is that if you’re in the EU, the basics are covered in an emergency for free with the EHIC, or European Health Insurance Card, scheme. The idea is that all EU citizens, regardless of whether they are a national of that country or not, are afforded the same fundamental medical support.

As the NHS puts it: “A valid European Health Insurance Card gives you the right to access state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland.

“The EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home. Treatment should be provided on the same basis as it would to a resident of that country, either at a reduced cost or, in many cases, for free.”

The EHIC also covers the treatment of pre-existing medical conditions and routine maternity care, as long as you’re not travelling to seek treatment or give birth.

Which is great. Or was, until we called time on our EU membership. What medical aid Brits can expect after we leave remains unclear. For now the scheme for UK residents remains unchanged.

It is completely free to register and receive your card through the NHS site. (If you’re trying to sign up and are charged for anything, including any admin, ‘review’ or ‘fast-track’ fees, you’ve stumbled onto a scammer’s page trying to get money out of you for something you categorically do not have to pay for. Don’t do it.)

Crucially though, EHIC is in no way a travel insurance alternative. It certainly won’t help if your wallet gets nicked on La Rambla, for example, or you don’t even get off the ground after your flight is cancelled.

Step foot outside your own front door in the pursuit of leisure and you should certainly have a travel insurance policy with your name on it. But where to start?

Holiday insurance

Your first choice is about duration – whether you want an annual policy or one off cover for a specific period. It goes without saying that if you’re planning to be away more than twice, an annual or multi-trip policy usually works out cheaper overall. If you only expect to venture away once a year, a single trip policy should do it. And that could be achieved for as little as £5.

The cheapest cover, of course, is those who are going to a very easy destination with top notch infrastructure, are in excellent health, and have no plans to do anything rash.

But that doesn’t mean the rest of us need to fork out a fortune for a policy that suits our circumstances.

Family travel insurance

Aimed at families travelling together, this kind of cover is typically suitable for two adults and up to four children aged to 18, and will usually come in cheaper than insuring each member individually. You may also get higher levels of cover on a family policy, including more baggage cover, alternative accommodation and cancellation cover.

Some policies include children free of charge and may also allow adults to travel independently without the kids on other trips.

Watch out for small print that varies from insurer to insurer though, especially when it comes to restrictions on age, whether you all live together at the same address and, believe it or not, if you’re a single parent family.

Click here to search for the cheap travel insurance deal for your family.

Travel insurance for the over 70s

The insurance world has been slow to acknowledge that many retirees these days want to travel the world with their new-found freedom. But while some insurers will only offer annual policies to up a certain age limit, it is possible to secure cover from a specialist insurer and get going.

There’s no getting away from the fact that the older you get the more likely you are to make a claim, whether it’s for medical treatment overseas or cancellations because you’re unwell. And that means you will pay more. But you do get extra cover for things like medical emergencies.

Yes, older travellers are more likely to have a pre-existing medical condition and may be denied cover because of it but specialist providers can and do older cover travellers with a range of problems… the application process may just be a little more in-depth.

If you find yourself refused by a general insurer because of your age, or the quote is sky-high, don’t give up. A specialist travel insurance provider will base their quote on your individual health and claims history and could prove cheaper.

For cheap travel insurance for over 70s from general and specialist insurers, click here.

Travel insurance for medical conditions

Top of the list of things standard insurance policies don’t cover, alongside terrorism and natural disasters, are pre-existing medical conditions.

If you have a medical condition or illness that you have had treatment for or even simply sought medical advice about, you will have to give the details to your insurer. That can include anything from cancer and heart problems to asthma, whether it is a current problem or something that happened decades ago.

The reality is that, because of the sheer cost to insurers of medical treatment overseas if something happens to you while you’re away, those with pre-existing conditions will pay more for their policy. But failing to disclose information can invalidate your cover and if disaster strikes, your claim will be rejected and it won’t pay out.

Once you’ve answered all the rather personal, in-depth questions you may be offered a standard policy after all. However, you may be refused a policy altogether, or something in between, such as imposing certain exclusions, terms or higher excess payments.

Your destination, because of the eye-watering cost of medical treatment in, for example, Canada, the USA, Spain, and the Caribbean, may also be a factor.

Compare travel insurance deals that fit your medical history.

Backpackers travel insurance

Backpacking isn’t like a ‘normal’ holiday and the insurance needs to cover you over an extended period across a multitude of countries. It should also include cover for working abroad and the kind of high octane sports that the young, free and adventurous go for.

Beware though, you’ll need to double check what extreme sports each policy will cover and the type of work – paid or voluntary if you plan to do any. Because of the market it is aimed at, you may struggle for a tailored backpackers’ policy if you’re above a certain age or have a pre-existing medical condition.

Travel in more risky areas and countries, such as war-zones or unstable regions, won't be covered so you need to be sure of the geographical boundaries for your policy too.

Find the cheap travel insurance for backpackers here.

Best travel insurance for winter sports

If you’re off to the slopes, you’ll need a comprehensive winter sports policy to cover you in case of injury or the loss or theft of your equipment as well as all the other benefits of a travel policy, including that all-important medical and repatriation cover.

For this, (including ice-skating, tobogganing, off-piste skiing and heli-skiing) you will need a specifically designed policy as standard, single trip insurance won’t usually cover you.

The small print for winter sports cover can be nasty, so read it thoroughly. Most won’t cover you for off-piste activity unless you have an instructor with you for example, and you may struggle for a policy if you also have a pre-existing medical condition.

And if you plan to indulge in a little apres-ski, bear in mind that travel insurance policies don’t cover you for injuries sustained under the influence of alcohol, at altitude or otherwise…

Trump again demands more NATO spending, mulls 'severe things' on North Korea

The long-awaited UN report into Israel's reoccupation of the main cities of the West Bank criticised both Palestinian militants and Israeli army tactics yesterday, but found no evidence to support claims that Israeli forces were responsible for a massacre in the Jenin refugee camp.

The report criticised Israel for the "widespread destruction of Palestinian property" in Jenin during the operation earlier this year but said Palestinian claims at the time that some 500 Palestinians had been wantonly killed "have not been substantiated".

The Israeli foreign ministry praised the report, saying it cleared up a "misconception" there had been a massacre.

Israel denied access to the UN team that prepared the report and gave it no information. It was forced to rely on published sources and statements from observers from six governments as well as from human rights organisations.

Around 1,500 families were made homeless when Israeli tanks and bulldozers demolished houses and shops in the narrow alleys in the heart of the refugee camp in April.

Palestinian officials as well as many foreign journalists said there had been a "massacre". The only reference to the word in the report itself is in eyewitness accounts "by survivors of the massacre at Jenin refugee camp" submitted by Jordan's UN mission.

In Jenin, where the refugee camp was levelled in several days of fighting, Palestinians despaired at what they considered the lack of international pressure on Israel to end the continuing curfews and withdraw. "This report will not provide anything for the Palestinian people," said Bassam Sbaihat, the Palestinian Authority official who liaises with the Israeli army, as he sat in his office near a vast mound of rubble where UN officials believe five bodies remain hidden.

The UN report said 52 Palestinian deaths had been confirmed by April 18, the same death toll reported by Israel. The UN findings mirrored those of Human Rights Watch. Up to half the Palestinian casualties may have been civilians rather than armed fighters, it said, but it was impossible to determine a precise figure.

Saeb Erekat, a senior negotiator for the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, said in mid-April that 500 people had been killed. The Israeli army spokesman, Brigadier Ron Kitrey, added to the confusion at the time by saying more than 200 people were dead in Jenin.

Israel initially agreed to a UN investigation but later claimed the team chosen by Kofi Annan, the secretary general, was not genuinely aimed at fact-finding. The Israeli government seized on the lack of corroboration of any massacre to say the whole investigation had come about "as the result of false Palestinian propaganda".

"The report overwhelmingly negates this Palestinian fabrication and repudiates the malicious lies spread regarding the issue", the foreign ministry said.

But the UN team has several criticisms of Israel's incursion, its biggest military deployment for two decades. It says that on at least three occasions Israeli forces targeted ambulances. Its use of heavy weaponry and helicopter gunships on densely populated civilian areas was disproportionate. Civilians were arbitrarily arrested and forced to strip. Round-the-clock curfews for several days left people without vital supplies or medical aid.

Palestinian militants are accused of violating international law by stockpiling weapons and putting fighters in the densely populated camp.

The report also looked at the entire West Bank reoccupation. Between March 1 and May 7, it said, 497 Palestinians had been killed in the West Bank. During the same period Israel endured around 16 terrorist bombings, mostly suicide attacks. More than 100 people were killed and scores wounded.

Mr Annan said he was confident the report was a "fair representation of a complex reality" but stressed that it dealt with abuses which continue. "While some of the facts may be in dispute, I think it is clear that the Palestinian population have suffered and are suffering humanitarian consequences which are very severe," he said. "I would hope that both parties will draw the right lessons from this tragic episode".

Nabil Shaath, a Palestinian cabinet minister, called the report an important step. "I know it doesn't satisfy everybody and it wasn't done in the way it should have been done. But still it identifies what happened in Jenin as a ... crime against humanity," he said.

However, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, Menzies Campbell, said: "This report is fatally flawed by the fact that the UN team of investigators ... was refused access to Jenin. Inevitably it undermines the authority of the secretary general."

The speakers connect to automated systems and can be used to call for help

Smart speakers that can tell you when your test results are due, change the room temperature or lower the blinds are coming to British hospitals.

Several NHS trusts are in talks with IBM to introduce the voice-activated bedside speakers, which resemble Amazon’s Echo speakers and are already used in the US. It is understood that they will come to a number of hospitals in the next two years.

The intention is to improve patients’ experiences by helping to meet their non-medical needs and to give frailer patients greater control of their surroundings. The speakers do not only connect to automated systems but can be used to call for emergency help without pressing a nurse-call button.

It is hoped that they will cut the time that…

Welcome back, international cricket. In 2020, after 15 years, English international cricket will be back on free-to-air TV.

It is tempting to declare this a revolutionary moment for English cricket. Certainly, it amounts to a tacit, albeit belated, admission that the ECB was wrong to remove cricket from free-to-air after the summer of 2005. It adds to the sense, too, that the ECB recognises cricket’s deep malaise - its declining participation and visibility, and the sense of a sport that has been left behind by the national conversation - and is determined to set it on a new course.

And yet these conclusions, even if largely justified, feel a little out of kilter with what has actually been announced. From 2020-24, all England home Test matches and one-day internationals will remain live and exclusive on Sky Sports. Only two men’s T20 internationals, and a solitary women’s T20I, will be available to watch free-to-air on the BBC - less than ten hours of live international cricket a year and, as evidenced by Eoin Morgan resting himself for last week’s deciding T20I against South Africa, in a format in which England almost invariably play a shadow side.

More significant is the commitment to live TV coverage of the new men’s T20 competition, showing ten games, including the final, as well as the women’s equivalent, in which eight matches will be shown. This could be potentially seminal for female cricket, given how free-to-air coverage of the Women’s Big Bash in Australia turbocharged the growth of the women’s game too. Awarding the BBC website highlights and clips of all internationals is promising, too.

But, compared to other sports, there will remain a paltry amount of live, free-to-view international cricket. The Six Nations have rejected more money from Sky to remain exclusively on free-to-air TV. The Wimbledon Tennis Championships remain exclusively on BBC, where it receives incessant coverage for a fortnight a year. The halcyon days of every England Test match live on free-to-air TV will never return - neither BBC nor Channel Four have any desire for it to - but Wimbledon’s example hints at how a marquee Test, packaged as a centre-piece of the British sporting summer, could be sold to free-to-air. The obvious solution is for the showpiece Lord’s Test of the summer - an event that, like Wimbledon, can transcend day-to-day followers of the sport - to be returned to free-to-air. Now, that won’t happen until 2025, at least - or probably ever.

Events such as Wimbledon get wall-to-wall coverage from the BBC (Getty )

In a sense the debate about free-to-air TV has long been hackneyed: changing viewing habits have made it less significant. That’s why, for the future of cricket, the most important part of the deal concerns smartphones and tablets. Rights for these were bundled with the TV package: whoever holds the TV rights for a format has them for smartphones and tablets too. In the case of every England home Test and ODI, that means Sky.

There is a sense of missed opportunity here. In 2008 Major League Baseball launched AtBat, allowing fans to pay as little as $19.99 a year to watch live matches, and call up statistics or action replays at will: effectively making each fan the director of their own private broadcast. It is the highest-grossing iPhone sports app of all-time, and was downloaded a record 11 million times in 2014. In Saving the Test, author Mike Jakeman discussed AtBat with cricket administrators, and was left hopeful that the sport would soon adopt a similar concept to reach out to newer fans. Four years later, we are still waiting.

All England home Test matches and one-day internationals will remain live and exclusive on Sky Sports (Getty)

For all the optimism in cricket about the new contract, it amounts to “something of a fudge,” warns Simon Chadwick, a TV marketing expert. “Cricket somehow finds itself trapped inside a gilded enclave, denied the opportunities attributable to free-to-air mass market TV whilst at the same time somewhat remote from the dynamism of the millennial and GenX markets.”

Cricket is a sport that has faded badly in the public consciousness. The number of adults playing at least once a month has fallen from 428,000 in 2008/09 to 308,000 today, according to official Sport England figures, and the Champions Trophy failed to break out beyond existing cricket fans. While the new bounty of cash - £1.1bn - holds out the promise of reinvigorating cricket at grassroots, the past decade has proved that extra TV money for cricket, however well-spent, can only do so much to combat a lack of visibility.

From 2020, cricket will have significantly more visibility on free-to-air TV, and digital platforms, than at any point since 2005. That is good news. Just do not mistake it for a solution to the sport’s urgent need to re-engage the public.

Congratulations to Angela Rayner, one of the rising stars of the Labour front bench, who is to be a grandmother, possibly the youngest in the history of the Commons at the age of 37. Her son, Ryan, and his girlfriend are expecting in December, by which time Rayner, left, has her own expectations of being in the cabinet as education secretary.

LONDON (Reuters) - Rafa Nadal continued his imperious run of form as he swept aside American Donald Young 6-4 6-2 7-5 in the Wimbledon second round on Wednesday.

The two-times champion was rarely troubled by an opponent ranked 43rd in the world who chose to slug it out from the back of the court against the supreme Spanish baseliner.

The fourth seed, who has yet to drop a set in the tournament, will face Karen Khachanov in the third round. The 21-year-old Russian is tipped to be a future winner of grand slams.

"It might look easy at this moment in our sport, because there are three players that won 18, 15, and 12," he said, referring to Roger Federer, himself and Novak Djokovic.

"But it not a very long time ago when (Pete) Sampras had 14, and it looked like nobody was going to have the chance to increase that number," Nadal added.

"Karen is a great player, he has chances to win a lot. But then there are other good players out there."

On current form, few people would bet against Nadal.

The 31-year-old, fresh from winning his 10th French Open title last month, was roared on by the crowd and he seemed to be able to produce winners at will with his swashbuckling forehand.

Young, 27, sought to mix up his play in the third set by rushing the net and he broke the Spaniard's serve. But in the end there was nothing he could do to prevent the Nadal juggernaut rolling on.

As Nadal left Centre Court, he was slightly taken aback when a fan asked him to sign a prosthetic leg, but he politely agreed.

Asked whether that was the strangest thing he had autographed, he chuckled: "Probably not".

500 years ago this year, Martin Luther launched the Reformation – a revolution in European society, based on one simple idea – the centrality of faith. Put simply, the idea was that at the heart of an individual’s relationship with God, or with anyone else for that matter, lies faith, or perhaps better, trust. Trust matters. Without trust, relationships, marriages, friendships, societies quickly fail.

We have seen the vital importance of trust and what happens when it is lacking in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire in the past few weeks. Being the Bishop of Kensington, I have been closely involved with the communities around the Lancaster West estate over the past fortnight and beyond, and have watched and listened to the growing frustration of residents, the anger directed towards the Council, the Government, in fact anyone in authority. The anger has taken some by surprise, but it is less shocking when seen against the background of the dreadful events of 14 June.

The Grenfell Tower fire did not happen in a vacuum. It came after many years of residents making complaints, feeling ignored and hearing promises that were not kept. Residents groups had often protested about the £10m refurbishment of Grenfell Tower that made it look good on the outside, without paying much attention to conditions and safety on the inside. A feeling has been growing among many residents, rightly or wrongly, that there were others who felt their presence was a nuisance, that it would be better if their blocks and homes were run down so that fancy expensive housing could be erected to be sold off for a greater profit to foreign investors. Complaints seemed to fall on deaf ears and in such a vacuum, conspiracy theories and rumours spread like wildfire. In other words, there has been a massive breakdown of trust.

People in the smart streets of South Kensington struggle to understand the visceral anger felt by their neighbours in North Kensington. From the perspective of the south of the Royal Borough, RBKC felt like a reasonably well run Council that did a good job of keeping the schools running and the streets clean.

The anger felt by those further north comes, not primarily as a result of a few days inaction by the Council or the Prime Minister failing to visit locals on her first visit to the site, but on the back of many years of feeling unheard, unwanted and excluded from decision making, all of which means that when officials, from the Prime Minister to the most menial employee of RBKC makes promises about keeping residents in the area, that air pollution levels are safe, and they have their best interests at heart, local people tend not to believe them.

When the name of the Judge of the Public Inquiry was announced, the fact that he had several years ago made a judgment that had relocated a woman well away from her home was evidence to suggest he would not bring justice to those who wanted it. The fact that it is not his job to adjudicate on matters of housing relocation during the Inquiry is beside the point. In an atmosphere of mistrust, the slightest thing can become a huge obstacle very quickly.

Mistrust is corrosive. In its miasmic presence, both true and false rumours gain credence, honest assurances are not believed, people assume the worst. Mistrust is like a fog in which it is hard to make out the genuine promise from the self-serving excuse. One of the key tasks facing those involved in the longer-term future of North Kensington is rebuilding trust. That task is long, takes careful determination and will not be done quickly. It requires repeated promises fulfilled, honest answers and a will from both sides to make it work. Some relationships that require trust (with the Tenant Management Organisation, for example) may be beyond repair, but elsewhere it will be as slow and painstaking as picking through the rubble of the Tower itself.

One of Martin Luther’s catchphrases was sola fides iustificat, which can be translated as “only trust makes things right”. Societies thrive with trust, they are destroyed by mistrust. As lives, families, and the community in the Lancaster West estate are rebuilt, unless a serious attempt to rebuild trust is made, suspicion will continue to reign and destroy the small shoots of progress. If trust can slowly but surely be established, then this community has a hope and a future.

CALGARY, Alberta Canada's energy regulator should shift the burden for ensuring quality of oil-and-gas pipeline parts from operators and move it more to manufacturers, according to an official report viewed by Reuters.

The National Energy Board (NEB) commissioned the report to improve the equality of pipeline parts after TransCanada Corp (TRP.TO) and Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO) discovered that some parts they were using were substandard.

Currently, operators often have to provide additional specifications for parts because standards are too low, placing them at a disadvantage, according to the report, which was provided to Reuters ahead of its public release.

"This creates an uneven playing field where pipeline operators with comprehensive specifications are placed in an uncompetitive position due to higher procurement costs," the report read.

Canada, home to the world's third-largest oil reserves, relies heavily on pipelines, making it imperative for them to be secure.

Policies should be developed "to ensure pipeline-operator quality strategies are transferred to all parties in the supply chain," according to the paper.

While the report's recommendations are not binding, NEB chief engineer Iain Colquhoun told Reuters this week the regulator's push for higher standards for manufacturers will ensure pipeline operators do not need to outline comprehensive additional specifications.

"We'll absolutely level the playing field," he said.

The higher standards would apply to all manufacturers who provide parts to Canadian pipeline operators, including South Korea's TK Corp (023160.KQ) and Italy's Valvitalia Sp (IPO-VALIT.MI), which had provided some substandard parts to TransCanada and Enbridge, according to the NEB.

TransCanada, which was among companies represented at an NEB workshop last week on quality assurance for pipeline parts, said it will use conclusions from the event to bolster its quality management program.

Enbridge, TK Corp and Valvitalia did not respond to requests for comment.

The Canadian Energy Pipelines Association, which includes TransCanada and Enbridge, said it is possible that manufacturers could still pass on some costs of the higher standards. But operators will not be heavily affected as they can make the money back through the lifecycle of their pipelines, CEPA said.

Colquhoun said possible new measures for quality assurance include more standardization of manufacturing methods and training for certain employees of pipeline operators.

The report recommended changes that also include more disclosures and tracking of materials from manufacturers.

The NEB will decide on detailed measures this year. It could take up to 2023 for changes to be adopted formally by the external standards association, but the regulator will take action if quality assurance issues demand immediate attention, Colquhoun said.

ROUGH CUT. NO REPORTER NARRATION. A fire at a luxury sports car dealership in Hamburg, site of the G20 summit, was most likely arson, the German city's fire department said on Thursday (July 6). Twelve Porsche cars were destroyed by fire in the early hours of the morning, according to local media and the fire department. Chancellor Angela Merkel is expected to welcome U.S. President Donald Trump later on Thursday before the meeting of the world's 20 most powerful nations begins a day later. Brazil and Saudi Arabia have cancelled their participation.

Before starting the most recent season of Last Week Tonight, John Oliver said there would be some restrain from talking about President Donald Trump week in, week out.

While talking about a remarkably broad number of topics, Trump’s dominance over headlines has, of course, ended up featuring most weeks on the HBO show.

Thanks to a string of offending Tweets, Oliver took aim at the former Celebrity Apprentice host once more, starting with the “absolutely indefensible” messages about MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski.

“He’s pretty open about how grossly shitty he can be, so we can’t be shocked when he suddenly is,” Oliver commented after one member of the administration attempted to defend the Tweet.

Following the Tweets, the announcement of the previously banned “travel ban” being partially allowed by the United States’ supreme court dominated the news.

“At first the ban was banned, but now the court has partially banned the ban ban, instituting a partial ban pending the possibility of a future partial ban ban,” quipped Oliver.

One result from the ruling, which was heavily protested around the United States, was that citizens with ‘a credible claim of a bonafide relationship with a person or entity’ within the country could stay.

Trump’s administration defined the ‘bonafide’ as including parents, spouses, children, adult son or daughters, sons and daughter-in-laws, and siblings, but not grandparents, aunts or uncles, nieces or nephews, cousins, or brothers or sister-in-laws.

“Grandparents don’t count as close family? Good luck telling them that,” said Oliver. After discussing how refugees promised a place in the United States, the host added: “This ban is cruel, it’s unnecessary, and it undermines our standing in the world.

“So you would think the President would at least be justifying its existence. Instead, he keeps derailing the conversation with his barrage of bullshit.”

Unfortunately, though, Trump managed to divert everyone’s attention away from the "travel ban" once more using his Twitter account. As you may know, the actual President of the United States, Leader of the Free World, posted the already-infamous Gif of himself body slamming someone with the CNN logo over their face.

Rather than play the Gif straight, though, Oliver played footage of one commentator on ABC reacting to the moving image.

“You know, at this point I have no choice but to admit that Trump was right: There is at least one grandparent who poses a grave and immediate threat to America,” Oliver said. “Unfortunately, it’s the grandparent currently in f**king charge of it.” Watch below.

Last month, Oliver called on Trump to “stop lying to coal miners” after extracting an interview from a 1990 Playboy magazine in which the President said “most people don’t have the imagination to leave their mine”.

The top U.S. diplomat at the United Nations blasted Russia and China on Wednesday for “holding the hands” of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as the Trump administration struggled to respond to Pyongyang’s latest ballistic missile test.

U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley chided Moscow and Beijing over their opposition to a Security Council resolution condemning North Korea and imposing greater economic sanctions for what she called its “sharp military escalation.”

She also said Pyongyang was “quickly closing off the possibility of a diplomatic solution” and suggested the United States would continue to consider military action if necessary.

“One of our capabilities lies with our considerable military forces,” Haley said during a Security Council meeting in New York. “We will use them if we must, but we prefer not to have to go in that direction.”

Haley’s pointed speech marked the latest effort by the Trump administration to rally allies and rivals around a common agenda to blunt North Korea’s progress, days after Kim’s regime tested an intercontinental ballistic missile with a range that experts said would put it within reach of Alaska.

But her remarks also illustrated the limits of the White House’s options and lacked specifics about what concrete steps the administration is considering. The missile test marks a new level of advancement in Kim’s pursuit of a nuclear weapon that could strike the continental United States. Analysts said a military confrontation could escalate quickly into a mass-casualty war across the Korean Peninsula and Japan, where the United States has stationed tens of thousands of troops.

The standoff cast a shadow as President Trump prepared for his first meeting with Russian President Vladi­mir Putin and his second with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit, which opens Friday in Hamburg. Trump also will meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the heads of U.S. allies Britain and Germany.

[Analysis: Trump has never had a plan for dealing with North Korea]

“We’ve been pretty consistent that we are never going to broadcast next steps,” deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters aboard Air Force One as the president traveled Wednesday to a short stop in Warsaw.

Before leaving Washington, Trump revealed more frustration with Xi, whom he has personally lobbied to enact sanctions on Chinese banks that do business with North Korean companies. The U.S. Treasury Department announced last week that it would block the Bank of Dandong, along the border region between China and North Korea, from accessing U.S. markets. Officials said this was the first of potentially greater sanctions by the United States.

On Twitter, Trump wrote: “Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter. So much for China working with us — but we had to give it a try!”

Chinese data released in April showed that China’s trade with North Korea grew 37.4 percent during the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2016. China said then that overall trade grew even as it complied with U.N. sanctions and stopped buying North Korean coal.

Russian and Chinese diplomats used the U.N. Security Council meeting to push their joint proposal for a suspension of North Korean nuclear and missile testing in exchange for a suspension of U.S. and South Korean military exercises. Both countries also condemned the U.S. anti­missile system being deployed in South Korea and called for it to be removed.

Early Wednesday in Asia, U.S. and South Korean forces fired missiles in joint military exercises that the U.S. Pacific Command cast as a show of “ironclad” resolve.

[U.S. and China split on North Korea]

Daniel Pinkston, a lecturer in international relations at Troy University in Seoul, said he saw no chance that Washington and Seoul would agree to halt joint exercises, calling it “a non-

starter.”

During the U.N. meeting, a Russian official questioned whether North Korea’s missile was an ICBM, suggesting it was an intermediate-range weapon.

That prompted Haley to request a second turn at the microphone, during which she said: “If you see this as a threat, if you see this for what it is, which is North Korea showing its muscle, then you need to stand strong. . . . If you choose not to, we will go our own path.”

Danny Russel, who served as senior Asia director at the National Security Council under President Barack Obama, said Trump has a “rare blue moon” opportunity this week to meet with and rally the major players — China and Russia on one side and Japan and South Korea on the other — toward some sort of unified display of condemnation of North Korea.

“What the administration needs to do is get China and Russia around an approach, even if it is not as testosterone-rich and muscular as the U.S. would like, so that the basic geometry is five on one, not three on three,” said Russel, now a diplomat in residence at the Asia Society in New York. “There is no formula, no path forward, other than war, that isn’t built on some degree of common cause between Washington and Beijing.”

Victor Cha, who served as senior Asia director at the NSC under President George W. Bush, said the U.S. sanctions on the Dandong bank were “a shot across the bow at the Chinese that what is happening is not working for us. It arguably gives [Trump] a stronger position going in” to the meeting with Xi.

The missile the Kim regime launched had been in the works for years. It flew higher and remained in the air longer than previous attempts, in what experts called a milestone for North Korea

[U.N. Ambassador Haley’s complaint: ‘Spending my 4th in meetings’]

South Korean authorities described North Korea’s test as a two-stage missile with a range of about 4,300 to 5,000 miles — enough to reach Alaska and other parts of North America.

South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo said there is a high probability that Pyongyang will stage another nuclear test and noted gains in its efforts to miniaturize a warhead — steps toward developing nuclear-tipped weapons capable of hitting the mainland United States.

Pyongyang’s test appeared to catch the United States by surprise. The Pentagon initially mislabeled the activity as a test of an intermediate-range missile before reclassifying it Wednesday as an ICBM with a range of at least 5,500 kilometers.

Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said that the missile “is not one we have seen before” and that it was launched from a site — the Panghyon airfield about 90 miles north of Pyongyang — that has not been used to test missiles before.

He emphasized that North Korea still has a number of steps to meet before a threat to North America is imminent, noting that Pyongyang has not yet demonstrated the ability to mount a nuclear warhead on an ICBM or show the lateral range necessary.

“But clearly, they are working on it,” he said.

Rauhala reported from Beijing. Anne Gearan and Dan Lamothe in Washington contributed to this report.

London’s Grenfell Tower fire victims aren’t furious just with local authorities for ignoring safety concerns raised before this month’s blaze killed at least 79 residents. They’re angry with journalists too.

As reporters covered the fire at the apartment block last week, some residents turned on Jon Snow of Channel Four News, the most senior of Britain’s news presenters, and accused journalists of being vultures attracted to death and tragedy. “You didn’t come here when people were telling you that the building was unsafe!” one man told Snow. “That is not newsworthy. You come here when people die. Why?”

The Grenfell residents are hardly alone in accusing the media of not serving their needs. It’s no secret that trust in the media has declined. But the latest Reuters Institute Digital News Report, published this week, provides sobering insights into how the digital revolution has disrupted the way we gather the information we believe we need to orient ourselves in the world, or in our neighborhood.

READ MORE: How to stop Kim Jong Un using his nukes

The report shows that trust in the media varies from country to country, from over 60 percent in the Scandinavian countries to the low 20s in Greece and South Korea.

In the United States, trust in the media has risen from 33 percent during last year’s election campaign to 38 percent this year.

That may be because, as the Reuters report notes, “concern about the spread of false news online” increased the perception of the value of professional journalism.

Most sobering is the report’s comment that “the economic outlook for most media companies remains extremely difficult.” That statement that doesn’t include the communications giants like Twitter, Facebook and Google, the latter two of which garner more than 80 percent of the advertising that used to go to traditional media.

But two issues are likely larger. One is what Janine Gibson, the chief editor of Buzzfeed UK, calls “representation without judgment.” Speaking at a seminar in London this week, Gibson said that the digital and social media world implicitly equates what news organizations spend time and money verifying, with “the guy in an attic” who puts out a piece of opinion masquerading as news, without having had to exercise his judgment on the veracity of his narrative.

READ MORE: Mosul’s fall won’t stop Islamic State spreading fear

The latter, said Gibson, “is of course much quicker than the news which checks, because checking takes time.” The result, too, can be duller. The more careful is the reporter, the more complex becomes the story. But the guy in the attic can be simple, dramatic – and attract the eyeballs.

At an extreme, the attic-writer is putting out “fake news” - a commodity popularized by President Trump, who seems to see all news which does not praise him as “fake.” Fake news may have won Trump the presidency. Even if not, his use of it gives credence to a tendency to distrust news we don’t like.

It’s also becoming clearer that measurements of “trust” in the news media don’t really measure trust in the news media. They measure pleasure gained from the media. The Digital News Report says that there exists “a strong connection between trust in the media and perceived political bias.” That is, people trust the reports which flatter and further their views.

This isn’t new: people have chosen publications which line up with their political choices throughout the history of news. But for most of that history, those who consumed journalism did so passively. There was no comeback, except through a letter to the editor (probably unpublished) or a cancelled subscription.

READ MORE: Macron shows his true colours

Now readers are empowered by technology, often aggressive in their distrust and disgust, to intervene in stories. James Harding, director of news at the BBC, speaking at the same event as Buzzfeed’s Gibson, said that “we at the BBC are very careful to make clear what we don’t know as well as what we know. But people now can fill the space of ’don’t know’ themselves”.

We still live in the first phase of a revolution, not just of journalism but also in the ways in which we seek and use information, and in what we place our trust. As printing disrupted the late medieval world, so the replacement of print by digits has disrupted the 21st century. It is presently calling into question the nature of truth, and the trust we can place in it.

Truth is hard to get right, especially at times of tragedies like that at Grenfell Tower. Finding and publishing it won’t always avoid anger directed at the messenger, but journalists need to show they are truth seekers rather than vultures feeding on tragedy.

That will give substance to journalism's necessary democratic role – and perhaps answer the “why” asked by the man who confronted Jon Snow.

The Epsom Derby, which takes place on Saturday, is the richest horse race in Britain and the most prestigious of the five so-called Classics.

It was first run in 1780 when the prize money was just over £1,000. Now, almost 250 years later, the purse is £1.5m.

So who's in the frame to win the race this year?

Few experts look beyond the top three in the betting: Cliffs of Moher, Cracksman and Eminent. But it's the latter, slightly longer priced at 7-1, which offers the best value.

"All three have plenty to recommend them," says Betfair, although the bookmaker adds that Cliffs of Moher and Cracksman "both have to improve to win". Eminent, meanwhile, "should be the same price" as his rivals.

Eminent also has a pretty good pedigree. Sporting Life's Catching Pigeons column believes he "can give the mighty Frankel his first win as a sire" on Saturday.

However, be warned: Cracksman is also a son of Frankel.

As for outsiders, Salouen at 66-1 could be an attractive option. He has "a much better chance of hitting the jackpot for Sylvester Kirk and Fran Berry in the premier Classic than his odds suggest," says Andy Stephens of Racing UK.

"His form ties in with many of the principals, he's got plenty of experience (which could count for more than untapped potential this year) and he will love the drying ground. Most significant of all, perhaps, is that everything about him suggests he will relish stepping up to 1m4f for the first time."

Oli Bell of Sporting Life agrees. "This is a horse who is rated in and around the best in the race. He's twice proven himself in Group 1 company and he's a horse who on pedigree will definitely enjoy the trip. And yet, despite all that, he's still a massive price in what is a very open renewal of the Derby," he argues.

If picking a winner is an inexact science, then identifying a no-hoper is rather easier. And 1,000-1 shot Diore Lia is just that says Marcus Armytage of the Daily Telegraph.

Her chances are similar to those of an ordinary mortal in the Olympic 100m final.

"It is in our British nature to want an underdog to do well and, as Foinavon's 50th anniversary in April and Leicester last year proved, the rags-to-riches outsider remains sport's greatest story," he says.

If you believe in miracles there's another horse to consider.

"If you must throw away a fiver each-way on the Derby, waste it instead on John Gosden's Pealer at 200-1.

"It has no earthly chance on form and, if I tipped it on the racing page, the men in white coats would take me away. But, in my eyes, he could have beaten Cracksman in an Epsom gallop last week. Stranger things have happened but, I am afraid, Diore Lia is not about to be one of them."

Epsom rebrands free-to-watch area Poundland Hill for Derby

11 May

Horse racing may be known as the sport of kings, but Epsom appears to have embraced a different social strata, teaming up with discount retailer Poundland for this year's Derby.

Under the deal, between main sponsors Investec and Steinhoff International, which owns the budget brand, the famous free-to-enter field at the centre of the racecourse will be renamed Poundland Hill for the race next month.

"The large area of land, which is located at the centre of the famous Epsom Downs racecourse, is free to enter for pedestrians with a small fee for coaches or buses carrying racegoers," says the Daily Telegraph.

However, "the decision to rebrand the iconic mound has attracted some ridicule on social media".

Poundland trading director Barry Williams brushed off the criticism. He said: "All of Britain loves the Derby and, as the people's store, we’re looking forward to helping make the people's hill at Epsom one of the best ways for the family to experience the Derby."

Not everyone was convinced and the move has angered some.

"At first, just laughter at what reads like an April Fool's Day joke; laughter that anyone could be so crass as to name a free-viewing area at the Flat's greatest race after a high-street firm synonymous with bargain-basement deals. But that laughter turns quickly to incredulity," says the Racing Post.

"For most of us, a summer's day at the races with friends and family is about dressing up, letting the hair down and leaving behind the cares and strains of day-to-day life, not having them rubbed in your face by the condescending branding of oblivious corporate suits.

"Anyone on Poundland Hill next month will not just be reminded of the fact that they have taken the budget option to Derby day, they will know that it was those in top hats and tails sipping champagne in plush boxes across the racecourse who thought this was an appropriate rebranding exercise."

Japan is renowned for its cherry blossom - beautiful blooms that surge forth and cloak the trees in an exquisite marshmallow pink come spring.

Cherry blossom season is a huge tourist draw, and it gets underway as early as mid-January in some parts, running until early May. The exact dates are meticulously calculated each year by experts, who forecast when and where the cherry blossom, known as sakura, will arrive.

The season broadly moves south to north; for example, Okinawa Island to the south of the mainland gets blossom in full bloom around mid-February, while Sapporo to the north expects sakura to blossom in early May.

This year, travel photographer Kristina Makeeva took a trip to Japan during the cherry blossom season – and captured some of the most beautiful pictures ever taken of the spectacle.

You do not have access to view this Atom.

Makeeva, 29, hails from Moscow but has travelled the globe in search of the best shots. Her images of Japan are among her most stunning – one image she took of a field swathed in blue flowers with a girl walking through holding a parasol garnered over 23,000 likes when she posted it to Instagram.

Makeeva’s beautiful imagery has earned her quite a following – to date she has more than 225,000 followers on the image-sharing social media platform.

“I started shooting about 14 years ago,” she tells The Independent. “Once I picked up a camera, I couldn’t put it down again.”

Makeeva's photos capture Japan in all its beauty ( Kristina Makeeva )

She travelled to Japan in early April. “That’s the best time to see the cherry blossom,” says Makeeva. Taking in Nara, Kyoto, Osaka, Tokyo, Himeji and Kanazawa on a whirlwind trip, she says that she found the sakura wherever she went. Although it’s tempting to put down the lushness of her pictures to filters and PhotoShop, Makeeva insists her inspirational subject was to thank for the end result. “Sakura in reality is more beautiful than in pictures,” she says.

Makeeva adds: “I’ve dreamed of going to Japan for so long. My favourite moment was seeing the cherry blossom floating down a river – it was just magical.”

If you’ve been inspired to catch Japan’s cherry blossom season, you may have missed the blooms this year, but it’s never too early to start planning your next trip.

Trump again demands more NATO spending, mulls 'severe things' on North Korea

WARSAW U.S. President Donald Trump once more urged NATO allies in Europe on Thursday to spend more on defence, on a visit to Poland that had been billed as an opportunity for him to patch up relations after a tense alliance summit in May.

Baron Corbin was left standing tall as Mr Money in the Bank after triumphing in a classic ladder match at the WWE pay per view in St Louis.

Five of Smackdown Live's very best put on a clinic in the night's main event but it was the Lone Wolf who emerged victorious, earning himself a WWE Championship match.

For now the WWE Champion is still Jinder Mahal after he retained his title earlier in the night against Randy Orton. Mahal dominated much of the match and picked up another big win over the hometown hero after Orton had again become distracted by The Singh Brothers, Mahal's entourage.

Elsewhere, The Usos robbed The New Day of what looked to be a certain tag team title win as they escaped from the ring mid-match with their championships just as the popular group looked to have wrapped things up. New Day claimed the win via count-out, meaning we are almost certain to see these two teams do battle again.

Naomi was another champ to retain on the night as she downed Lana - the Russian challenger still impressive in her efforts. A bonus match was added during the night as Brezango defeated The Ascension after it was revealed the towering duo were behind the recent attack on Tyler Breeze.

After such a huge build-up, a solid women's MITB ladder match was well worth a watch but was ultimately let down by a cheap finish that saw, with help of James Elsworth, Carmella declared the victor despite not actually retrieving the coveted briefcase herself.

Returning Smackdown General Manager Daniel Bryan threatened to get to the bottom of the controversy on this week's television, but these pioneering women deserved a clear and decisive finale to such a landmark match.

Money in the Bank results:

Baron Corbin won men's Money in the Bank

Carmella won women's Money in the Bank

Jinder Mahal d. Randy Orton

Naomi d. Lana

The New Day d. The Usos by count out

Brezango d. The Ascension

Former British PM says ministers calling for public sector pay cap to be lifted wanted to spend money they might need in future

David Cameron has described critics of austerity as “selfish”, saying their calls to boost spending and raise public sector pay may appear compassionate but would simply saddle future generations with debt.

The comments triggered a furious response from Labour and the Lib Dems, who described the former prime minister as totally out of touch, claiming it was astonishing he could make the argument when nurses were turning to food banks to get by.

Cameron’s remarks could also reopen the wounds of the EU referendum as they were widely interpreted as an attack on the two most significant Vote Leave figures, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove.

The foreign secretary and environment secretary, whose successful Brexit campaign cost Cameron his political career, have both broken ranks in recent days to hint that the 1% public sector pay cap should be lifted.

Their comments, alongside cabinet level interventions by Justine Greening at education and Jeremy Hunt at health, have ramped up the pressure on Theresa May and the chancellor, Philip Hammond.

The pair have faced demands from dozens of MPs to ease the pain for families by raising pay and blocking school cuts after Jeremy Corbyn’s radical, anti-austerity Labour party stance secured gains in the general election.

Many feel action is urgent after a government-commissioned report suggested the average pay of teachers had fallen by £3 an hour in real terms, police officers by £2, while the wages of nurses have stagnated.

But Cameron used a speech in Seoul, South Korea, to come to his successor’s defence by saying it was too soon “to let spending and borrowing rip” because of the danger of future economic shocks.

“The opponents of so-called austerity couch their arguments in a way that make them sound generous and compassionate,” he told the Asia Leadership Conference. “They seek to paint the supporters of sound finances as selfish, or uncaring. The exact reverse is true.

“Giving up on sound finances isn’t being generous, it’s being selfish: spending money today that you may need tomorrow.”

The Guardian view on public sector pay: Hammond stares into the abyss | Editorial Read more

His comments led to an angry response from opposition politicians who lined up to say that Cameron had no idea how much people were struggling – and suggested it was crass to use a well-paid speech to make the argument.

The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, accused the senior Conservative figure of living “in a different world from the rest of us”.

“Only David Cameron would say that hard-working people seeing their living standards fall back and their pay suppressed is good for them. It just further shows how out of touch he was then, and still remains today.”

The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, described it as a “pretty rich for a multimillionaire to tell our hard-working firefighters, paramedics, nurses and doctors that they don’t deserve a pay rise”.

“But I guess you would think that if you are jetsetting around the world to give highly paid speeches – you don’t really understand how millions of public sector workers have to scrimp each month to get by,” he added, giving examples of nurses visiting foodbanks and asking how Cameron considered them to be “paid enough”.

A spokesman would not say how much the former Tory leader had received for the speaking engagement, but confirmed that he was paid.

The shadow Treasury minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said Cameron was “completely out of touch and has no awareness of the country he used to lead”.

But Cameron is not the only one to urge calm within the Tory party after a public spat at the top of government over the issue of public sector pay.

Sources said that the chief whip, Gavin Williamson, had been speaking to colleagues about the need for “unity and discipline” with a number of one-on-one meetings with cabinet ministers.

The former work and pensions secretary, Stephen Crabb, suggested it was wrong for such senior figures to speak out so publicly against government policy.



Nigel Lawson, a former chancellor under Margaret Thatcher, said it was Hammond’s job to keep control of public spending to avoid “economic disaster”.

“It’s not easy but it is necessary,” he told the BBC. “People understand we need to pay our way on the road to economic success.” He argued that the arguments needed to happen in private. “Stop having this debate in public, it’s ludicrous.”

Hammond also tried to defuse the row by calling on his party to “hold its nerve”, claiming that the only way to free up spending was higher taxes, more borrowing or stronger growth.

Like Cameron, the chancellor has argued that borrowing piles debt on to the next generation and has insisted the Tories are a party of low tax.

Martin Rowson on the Conservatives and public sector pay – cartoon Read more

He has said growth was the only sustainable way to boost public spending in the long run, although sources suggest he is ready to talk about ways to raise money to loosen the ties of austerity over the coming months.

One senior Treasury figure said despite that, things would continue to be financially constrained in the run-up to Brexit.

Rises of 1% for dentists, nurses, doctors and the military have already been agreed for this year, and Downing Street said ministers would respond to other pay review recommendations within days. Teachers, police and prison officers are next in line.

It came alongside a call from civil servants to ensure that any lifting of salaries also included them.

Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union that represents senior managers and professionals in public service said his members would welcome “warm words from a number of cabinet ministers over lifting the public sector pay cap.

“But warm words won’t pay the bills. The majority of civil servants are not covered by pay review bodies and so those very same ministers have it within their control to lift the pay cap for civil servants in their department.

“We have today written to those ministers, calling on them to follow up their words with action. If they believe the pay cap should be lifted, then they can begin with the civil servants in their departments who support them as ministers and deliver vital public services.”

Why go now?

There’s a compelling reason for visiting in 2017. Every rupee spent in hotels and restaurants, shops, taxis or temples is helping Kathmandu get back on its feet. Nearly two years after the earthquake that devastated swathes of Nepal and severely damaged the capital, Kathmandu is bouncing back to its alluring self with astonishing verve. Rebuilding and restoration is proceeding apace while tourists are returning to bathe in the Himalayan city’s sensory overload: temples and squares, prayer flags and sputtering scooters, merchants yelling behind marigold-garlanded stalls amid wafts of incense, spices and holy cow dung.

Get your bearings

The old city, known as Durbar Square, lies at the centre of Kathmandu. To its north, frenetic Thamel is a maze of hotels, restaurants, trekking agencies and shops. To the south, the Bagmati River borders peaceful Patan district with its own Durbar Square and expatriate communities. Beyond the former Royal Palace to the east are the smarter shopping centres and embassies.

Local tempos (minibuses) and buses are best avoided – they’re crowded, slow and not the safest. However, taxis are cheap and plentiful and rickshaws can be a useful way of travelling short distances.

Day one

Take a view

Puff your way up the 400-step stone staircase to the Buddhist stupa of Swayambhunath (1), known as “Monkey Temple” on account of the hundreds of “holy” monkeys who will be your chattering, food-begging companions. If the day is clear, the whole of Kathmandu valley unfurls at your feet. You will see from here how localised the earthquake damage was; isolated pockets have collapsed like cards while large areas remained more or less unscathed.

Take a view from the Swayambhunath temple, but watch out for the monkeys (Getty)

Take a hike

Nowhere is the localised nature of the earthquake damage more apparent that in the area known as Durbar Square, a riot of ancient palaces, temples and royal monuments which comprise the UNESCO-listed historic heart of Kathmandu.

Start at the northern Thamel end check post (2) where tourists pay an entrance fee of 1000Rs (about £7.70) for free run of the whole area. Join throngs of pilgrims at Shiva-dedicated Mahendreshwar Mandir (3) with its chiming bells and flickering candles. Follow the flow down to Jagannath Mandir (4), a Hindu temple which attracts gawping fascination on account of its athletic and imaginative erotic carvings which seem to suggest that the earth has always moved in these parts.

If it’s between 10am and noon, keep an eye out – the Kumari Devi, or living ‘child-goddess’ might put in an appearance at her window above the courtyard of her magnificently carved sacred home, the Kumari Dar (5). However, now that you are down at the south end of the historic region, the heartrending extent of the earthquake damage becomes unavoidable. Cordoned off for safety is the red brick old Royal Palace, (6) whose walls are now cracked, while the adjacent Basantapur Tower (7) somehow remains precariously erect. Exit via “Freak Street” (official name Jochne) (8), the legendary 1960s hippy hangout (though its glory days are now over).

If you're lucky, you may catch a glimpse of the Kumari Devi, or living child goddess (Getty)

Lunch on the run

Climb six flights of stairs to the rooftop Kasthamandap Café (9) at 23 Maru (00 977 1 6219177, no website) for an open-air coffee, a snack under a sun umbrella and commanding views over Durbar Square.

Window shopping

The Thamel district, north of Durbar Square, survived the earthquake more or less intact and remains the backpacker hub (a successor to Freak Street). It’s a carnival of noisy alleys and tiny squares, packed with hundreds of trekking agencies and shops hawking everything from tourist tat to genuine Tibetan antiques. One good bet for quality thanka paintings and woven rugs, is Amrita Craft (10) on Chhetrapait.

You'll find colourful handicrafts galore at Amrita Craft (Amrita Craft/Facebook)

An aperitif

Owner Prakash will probably be around to welcome you in person to Zibro (11) on Chaksibari Marg (00 977 984 1059449, no website), his laid-back rooftop bar where young Nepalis shoot the breeze with holidaying Indians and European travellers. The music is one multi-cultural message too, with songs from little known local bands playing Nepali folk-rock fusion in the background. It’s a great place to make new friends over a glass of local craft beer Khumbu Kolsch.

Dine with the locals

At Bhojan Griha (12), on Dilli Bazaar in the eastern district of Kathmandu, traditional “Newari” dishes are served to guests in a 19th-century mansion, restored with painstaking attention to detail. Dishes include buffalo meat or vegetable-filled momo dumplings, and duck with peanuts and spiced lentils. The restaurant says that all produce is organic and no plastic is used. Mains around £6-8.

Day two

Get up early for a dawn flight to see the Himalayas in a prop plane (more robust than this one) (AFP/Getty Images)

Take a ride

For the ride of your life, board a small propeller plane for a dawn “Mountain Flight” along the crest of the Himalayas. You’ll pass up close and personal many of the world’s highest peaks, including Mount Everest. Flights are in the early mornings when conditions are generally clearest, but good views are weather-dependent and weather-related cancellations are frequent. An hour-long flight with Buddha Air costs US$192 (£158).

Sunday morning: out to brunch

La Dolce Vita (13), at Chaksibhari Marg (00 977 1 4700612, no website), doesn’t have the best coffee in Kathmandu, but what it lacks in a caffeine fix it makes up for with delicious Italian pastries, pasta and gnocchi, sprinkled with grated yak’s cheese. Sit on the sunny terrace watching the street dramas of chaotic Thamel below. Open from 11am, meals around £8-10.

Thamel is the backpacker hub, though it has nothing on 'Freak Street' (Shoestring at wts/Wikivoyage via Wikimedia Commons)

A walk in the park

It says a lot that Swapna Bagaicha (14) on Kaiser Mahal, Tridevi Marg, is also known as the Garden of Dreams. A botanical park and serene retreat from the frenetic city, it’s just a few minutes’ walk from central Thamel. Sadly, the park took a hard hit in the earthquake, damaging some of the neo-classical pavilions, statues, ponds and fountains. Nevertheless, the plants are still lovingly tended and the 200R (£1.50) entrance fee is being put to good restorative use.

Cultural afternoon

The historic Buddhist city of Patan – effectively a suburb of Kathmandu – is a 20-minute taxi ride across the tea-coloured Bagmati River. Patan is a repository of temples, palaces and stupas strewn around its own Durbar Square. Sadly, several of these took hits in the earthquake. The façade of the Kwa Bahal (15), also known as the Golden Temple, is one almost untouched highlight; the four giant, prayer flag-festooned Ashoka Stupas (16) are another. And then there’s the fact it’s guarded by scores of “holy tortoises”.

The icing on the cake

Treat yourself to a massage by a Seeing Hands blind masseur whose fingers are attuned to muscle and tissue in ways that the sighted will never match. At the same time, support this commendable organisation which provides employment and independence for Nepal’s blind men and women. A range of therapies are offered in a clinical setting, in its premises off Jyatha Road, Thamel (17).

Travel essentials

Getting there

Qatar Airways flies to Kathmandu via Doha from Heathrow, Manchester, Birmingham and Edinburgh, from £685 return. Other options include Etihad via Abu Dhabi and Jet Airways via Delhi or Mumbai.

Staying there

Hotel Shangri-La (18) is, as the name suggests, as swanky as Kathmandu gets. It’s an inviting, low-rise modern hotel with traditional flourishes in a lush garden with cool pool. Doubles from £105, B&B.

Something of a Thamel institution – everyone from Jeremy Irons to Ricky Martin have stayed here – the Kathmandu Guest House (19) is a bit rough round the edges these days, but still a good mid-range choice – it’s located in a former palace. Doubles from £65, B&B.

On a budget? Hotel Horizon (20) is a gem tucked away in an alley near the north end of Durbar Square. Breakfast on sequinned cushions in the courtyard is a treat. Doubles from £24, B&B.

When Joe Root leads England against South Africa at Lord’s tomorrow it will have been 144 days since he was appointed Test captain.

The staging of the Champions Trophy has meant a rather belated start to the Test summer this year but this four-match series against opponents who have not lost in England since 1998 promises much for Root, his team and cricket lovers everywhere.

“I’m very excited,” he said. “It has been a very long wait for this week to finally come around and to get the squad together has been fantastic. I just want to get out there.”

England have not played a Test since their 4-0 hammering in India last winter – a gap of more than six months.

It was a result that saw Alastair Cook resign as captain after four years in the job.

Root’s appointment offers a fresh start for a team who lost eight Tests in 2016.

He certainly cut a confident figure at Lord’s today as he announced England’s XI almost a full 24 hours before the toss.

Root confirmed Hampshire spinner Liam Dawson, who made his debut in England’s previous Test in Chennai last December, will play ahead of Toby Roland-Jones, the Middlesex seamer.

Root offers the chance for a fresh England start (Getty)

The Yorkshireman branded the team “exciting”.

But the inclusion of the utilitarian Dawson and a recall for Gary Ballance takes the edge of that notion somewhat.

This is very much Root’s team, with the pick of his Yorkshire team-mate Ballance almost entirely at the captain’s behest.

Ballance endured a torrid winter, scoring 24 runs in two Tests against Bangladesh before he was dragged around India like an unwanted mascot.

Ballance has been handed another chance with England thanks to Root (Getty)

However, after averaging more than 100 for Yorkshire in the County Championship this season, the Zimbabwean-born batsman has a third – and surely final – chance to show he can cut it at Test level.

Asked if this was his squad, Root said: “Yes. We had a selection meeting and I am very happy with the squad we came away with.

“In terms of Gary I look at how he has performed this year and the amount of runs he has scored - he has been phenomenal. When he has scored them has generally been when the side has been up against it.

“He is that sort of character and a lot of people asked questions about the last time he played for England but I look at his game now, as do the other selectors, and he is a completely different player. He is desperate to prove a point and score some runs in this series.”

Playing Ballance at No3 looks like one of the riskiest batting selection calls by England since Ravi Bopara was used in that position against Australia in the 2009 home Ashes.

Yet it is Root’s insistence that he wants to bat at four that has led to it.

“I have had a long time to think about a few things and that is the decision I have made,” he said. “I think it is where I play my best cricket and where I have scored my best runs.”

Improving England’s Test form after a poor 2016 will be imperative for Root ahead of this winter’s Ashes in Australia.

“I wouldn’t have taken the job if I didn’t think I was capable of taking the side forward,” he said. “We had a tough year last year in Test cricket but I think the squad is very settled, has learned a lot from that and is ready to put that right this year.”

Root has faith in his new-look team (Getty)

Root will be helped in his new role by Ben Stokes, his combative vice-captain and the team’s heartbeat. “He’s always been a bit of an attack dog,” said Root. “I see him as a feisty character who is desperate to do well and naturally he’s very good at setting the tone and setting the example.

“People look up to him, naturally, by the way he goes about his cricket. Hopefully we’ll get a good blend together as captain and vice-captain. That excites me.”

South Africa are unbeaten in Lord’s Tests since their readmission to world sport in 1991 and despite missing captain Faf Du Plessis, not yet returned from the birth of his first child back home, they will pose a significant threat.

Debutant opener Heino Kuhn and Theunis De Bruyn will be the perceived weak links in the batting line-up. But opener Dean Elgar, who will stand in as captain for Du Plessis, believes now is a good time to play England.

“I see it as a good opportunity for us to try make a dent,” he said. “They have their own insecurities within their team. They’re under new leadership, have a few new faces in their batting line-up, a few injury concerns.”

The tourists also possess the most exciting young fast bowler in the world in Kagiso Rabada, who took 13 wickets in his last Test against England at Centurion in January 2016.

“I’m glad he’s in my team,” said Elgar. “I’m sure he’ll be up for it. He hasn’t played a lot of cricket of late so I’m sure his hunger is through the roof.”

Teams

England: Alastair Cook, Keaton Jennings, Gary Ballance, Joe Root (captain), Jonny Bairstow (wicketkeeper), Ben Stokes, Moeen Ali, Liam Dawson, Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Mark Wood.

South Africa (probable): Dean Elgar (captain), Heino Kuhn, Hashim Amla, JP Duminy, Temba Bavuma, Theunis De Bruyn, Quinton De Kock (wicketkeeper), Morne Morkel, Kagiso Rabada, Keshav Maharaj

Sir Vince Cable calls deal between British electronic payment company and US rival ‘cheap pickings’ after Brexit-vote devaluation of pound

Worldpay, which handles 40% of all card payments at tills in Britain, has agreed to a £7.7bn potential takeover by US rival in a move that has rekindled the debate about foreign takeovers.

The cash-and-shares offer makes Worldpay the latest British company to be snapped up by a foreign buyer after the Brexit vote, which triggered a sharp fall in the value of the pound.

Cambridge-based Arm Holdings was bought by Japan’s SoftBank for £24bn last July, and other deals include the engineering group WS Atkins, which was bought by Canada’s SNC-Lavalin for £2.1bn in April.

The Worldpay deal was announced after intense talks through Tuesday night following its admission that it had been approached by Vantiv and JP Morgan Chase, driving its shares up 28%.

On Wednesday, after Worldpay said it had agreed terms about a “possible offer” with Vantiv, JP Morgan pulled out and Worldpay’s shares ended 8% lower at 372p – the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100.

Sir Vince Cable, running to be leader of the Liberal Democrats and former business secretary, tweeted: “Another top British company #Worldpay at risk following #Arm. Cheap pickings after #Brexit vote devaluation. Need reform #TAKEOVER rule.”



Vince Cable (@vincecable) Another top British company #Worldpay at risk following #Arm. Cheap pickings after #Brexit vote devaluation. Need reform #TAKEOVER rules.

“From a British perspective, it’s a shame to see another ground-breaking UK tech company selling out to overseas competition, perhaps before reaching full potential on its own,” said Jasper Lawler, head of research at financial firm London Capital Group.

The payments sector is experiencing a period of rapid growth, as more people shift from cash to paying by card and online, which is sparking takeovers. Over the weekend, Nets, the Danish payments services company, said it had been approached by potential suitors.

The rise of contactless cards has further accelerated the trend, becoming a popular payment method for lower-value transactions that were traditionally dominated by cash. Figures from the British Retail Consortium show that cash was used for less than half of all UK retail transactions for the first time in 2015.

Worldpay has been listed on the stock market since 2015 and if the deal goes ahead, its shares will be delisted and the combined group will continue with Vantiv’s listing in New York. Worldpay shareholders would own about 41% of the new group.

The value of the deal varies with Vantiv’s share price but when it was announced it valued Worldpay shares at 385p each, including a 5p dividend. This is a 19% premium on their value on Monday, the day before the British company confirmed the approaches.

The premium is lower than that offered in recent deals, such as the 40% offered for Arm. “It looks like it’s smaller than the market was expecting,” said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

Details of the cost savings that might be achieved were not announced, but Worldpay said: “The boards of Worldpay and Vantiv see a compelling strategic, commercial and financial rationale for combining Worldpay and Vantiv’s complementary businesses.

“The potential merger creates a scale world-class payments group in a dynamic market … It will serve a wide range of customers, with a strong position in the four core regions of the US, Europe, Asia-Pacific and South America.”

Worldpay shareholders should decline its meek merger deal Read more

It is thought Worldpay and Vantiv could operate from dual headquarters in London and Cincinnati, where the companies are respectively based. While there is little overlap between the two businesses in Britain and Europe, there is a greater crossover in the US.



“The boards of Worldpay and Vantiv have identified substantial opportunities for cost synergies, which support significant potential shareholder value creation,” Worldpay said.

It was unclear on Wednesday whether a deal would result in job losses at the combined group, or how it might affect Worldpay’s various British offices. The company has 5,000 staff in London, Manchester, Cambridge and Gateshead.

Vantiv will dominate the board with seven members, including Charles Drucker as executive chairman and co-chief executive. Four Worldpay directors will join the board of the new group, including Philip Jansen as co-chief executive and Sir Michael Rake, BT chairman and former Barclays deputy chairman, in a non-executive role.

Launched in 1989, Worldpay provides the technology that allows retailers and other business to accept card payments and online or mobile transactions. It was previously owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, which sold the business in 2010 to private equity firms Advent and Bain Capital as part of the terms of the bank’s 2008 taxpayer bailout.

What Las Vegas giveth, Las Vegas taketh away. Eighteen years after the Bellagio opened and redefined luxury in Sin City, rumours are afoot that the resort plans to ditch its most famous feature – the dancing fountains.

The fountains – which cost $40 million to build and contain 22 million gallons of water – are one of the top attractions in Vegas. Set in “Lake Bellagio”, facing onto the infamous Strip, they “dance” with choreographed movements every half hour to tracks such as Viva Las Vegas, Luck Be a Lady, and My Heart Will Go On, as well as more modern tracks from the likes of Tiesto. Some casino high rollers are allowed to pick a song from the playlist – though that honour is reserved for few big spenders.

But a report in the Las Vegas Review Journal claims that executives at MGM Resorts, which owns the Bellagio, have discussed plans to turn the 8.5-acre site into a “boutique shopping and restaurant promenade.”

“It’s incredibly valuable real estate that earns the hotel nothing,” a source told the newspaper. “It has had a long run as a tourist attraction, but now it’s time to make it a revenue earner.”

The fountains are known as being a rare free attraction in a city that encourages spending at every opportunity. However, the restaurants on Lake Bellagio command premium pricing to match the views, and tables nearest the water are reserved for big spenders.

Vegas, of course, is no stranger to “boutique shopping promenades”. Most of the upmarket casinos have malls attached - Bellagio already counts brands such as Bottega Veneta, Dior and Louis Vuitton in its clutch.

It is believed the plans have been inspired by the decision to replace the golf course at the rival Wynn resort with a water park. Owner Steve Wynn was behind Bellagio, and is regarded as Vegas’ biggest mogul.

In response to the rumours, MGM Resorts issued a statement saying, “We have no plans or intention to eliminate the iconic Bellagio Fountains, one of the most identifiable tourism landmarks in the world.”

But the statement did not deny that discussions have been held.

Blogger Scott Roeben, whose Vital Vegas site often covers stories the casinos prefer to keep quiet, told The Independent:

“Las Vegas is in a constant state of evolution. Freebies were once enticements; now they're rewards for loyalty. People who come to see free shows aren't the ideal casino customer.

“While the fountains would be missed, casinos have to do the same cost/benefit analysis any business would. While free attractions appear to draw crowds, that rarely translates into gambling or other revenue for the casino. There are numerous examples of casinos eliminating or downsizing their free offerings, including the Sirens of TI show at Treasure Island. It had zero impact on their bottom line, other than to bolster it with the cost savings.

“The Bellagio fountains are certainly iconic, and they're known around the world. But it's not on the shoulders of Bellagio or its ownership, MGM Resorts, to provide a free attraction used to promote Las Vegas. Their responsibility, for better or worse, is to shareholders.

“But while I'm sure a move like this has been discussed at some point, the possibility it will happen is remote. It would be a public relations nightmare, for starters.”

A final decision is expected by mid-summer.

Joan Burton, the former tánaiste, has opposed the development EAMONN FARRELL/ROLLINGNEWS

A German discount supermarket chain has been given the go-ahead for a new store in an upmarket Dublin suburb, despite opposition from locals including the taoiseach and a former tánaiste.

Lidl welcomed yesterday’s An Bord Pleanála ruling, which upholds the decision of Fingal county council to grant planning permission for the outlet as part of a €15 million mixed-use development in Castleknock village.

Three of the four Dublin West TDs — Leo Varadkar, Joan Burton, the former tánaiste and Labour leader, and Fianna Fáil’s Jack Chambers — opposed the new store, located in the heart of the constituency.

The project also includes three new buildings around a street and public spaces, which will also have a medical centre, bakery, off-licence, underground car park and several…

The White House and a pair of influential conservative advocacy groups have endorsed a proposal by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) that would allow health insurers to offer cheaper, less-comprehensive plans as long as they also offered at least one plan that includes the essential consumer protections required by the Affordable Care Act. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has sent Cruz's proposal to the Congressional Budget Office for cost-benefit analysis.

Wednesday's endorsement of the Cruz amendment by the leaders of FreedomWorks and the Club for Growth "is significant: Without at least a neutral stance from conservative groups, it could be impossible for McConnell to find the 50 votes needed to pass a repeal this month," Politico reports. "But what the right is asking for may not be able to pass the Senate." The proposal may well violate budget rules that McConnell is using to push through his bill with 51 votes, and more centrist senators and outside insurance experts are concerned that it would essentially price people with pre-existing conditions and other high medical needs out of the insurance market.

"People who have higher health-care needs and need more comprehensive coverage would choose ACA-compliant plans," said Cori Uccello at the American Academy of Actuaries. "People who are healthy now would tend to choose noncompliant plans with really basic benefits. People who want or need more comprehensive coverage could find it out of their reach, because it might become unaffordable." Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who was frequently thanked during July 4 festivities for helping at least slow down the bill, agreed that the Cruz language "would lead to adverse selection in the marketplace," adding: "It would also vitiate the important consumer protection of having a prohibition against annual and lifetime caps" on benefits.

Cruz and his allies argue that the amendment would lower premiums and allow individual consumers to essentially opt out of ObamaCare, but touching the pre-existing condition language may be a deal-breaker for other Republicans. "Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee is speaking against it in caucus lunches and Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska, a staunch conservative, also vocally opposes Lee and Cruz's idea," Politico says. "Many senators believe that the House made a critical error by allowing states to opt out of pre-existing condition protections and are determined not to touch that part of ObamaCare." A Senate vote could come as early as next week. Peter Weber

There are few names in the world of tech more trusted than Nokia.

Many of us grew up with the brand as the go-to company for the easiest-to-use, most reliable, best-designed mobile phones.

And French company Withings in recent years has built a fearsome reputation for brilliant home appliances that had wireless connectivity before other companies even got into the smart home game.

Its bathroom scales tell you your weight, fat content, water content, bone mass, muscle mass, heart rate, pulse wave velocity (a measure that's related to heart health), and even show recent trends and what today’s weather is like, all in the space of a few seconds as you stand bleary-eyed on them in the morning.

Other gadgets included a cuff that can record your blood pressure, a super-accurate thermometer and an elegant smart watch with, get this, proper analogue hands and a dial that counts your steps.

In fact, about the only negative you could come up with about Withings was not knowing how to pronounce its name.

Well, that problem’s gone because now the company has been integrated into its parent, Nokia.

Simultaneously the range of smart wireless things (that phrase was the inspiration for the Withings name, by the way) has increased to include a new set of bathroom scales, the Nokia Body BMI Wi-Fi connected scale, which is noticeably less expensive than others in the range (£55) and shows trends for weight gain or loss, access to BMI trends and data and more. It recognises up to eight users, all synchronised to the smartphone app.

There's also a new blood pressure cuff, the Nokia BPM+, which is compact enough to be portable enough to travel with. It's designed so you can share data with a medical professional. It'll sell for £115.

And the comprehensive Withings smartphone app has been updated with a wholly new, entirely elegant-looking interface.

I have to say it’s not quite ready yet. I’ve been using the Withings apps for six years and it’s been utterly reliable, if not the best-looking app out there.

Now I’ve updated to the much better-looking Nokia app and, well, the data for the whole of 2016 is missing from an overview. And the graph of my weight is dodgy. Look at the graph and it seems unable to accurately show my weight in stones and pounds. Tap an individual weight and it then finds the right figure.

I’ve spoken to Nokia about this and it’s a known issue, which mostly vanishes if you measure your weight in kilograms. Fair enough, though let's hope they solve that soon, as one of the standouts of the Withings app was that it accommodated imperial weights.

Switching to metric means all of my 2016 data comes back. When sorted, this could be a significant improvement over the Withings app, but for now, it needs more work.

That apart, the combination of Nokia and Withings teases a promising future for connected health technology.

LONDON Finance firms should not be forced by regulators to change location after Britain leaves the European Union in 2019, Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the UK's Financial Conduct Authority told a Reuters Newsmaker event on Thursday.

Banks, insurers and asset managers based in Britain are already making contingency plans to shift some operations to continental Europe after Brexit takes effect in case access to the EU single market is closed off.

But Bailey said Britain and the EU are in a position to preserve free trade for financial services, meaning such moves need not happen.

"Firms should be able to take their own decisions on where they locate, subject to appropriate regulatory arrangements being in place which preserve the public interest," Bailey said, in his first major speech on Brexit since Britain triggered the formal EU divorce proceedings in March.

"Authorities should not dictate the location of firms," he told an audience in Canary Wharf, home to some of the world's biggest banks.

Future financial sector relations between Britain and the EU should be based on "mutual recognition" or regulatory cooperation "but not exact mirroring" of rules, Bailey said.

Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam, Luxembourg and Dublin are all vying for a slice of Britain's financial services industry after Brexit. Bailey said such competition was good.

But he also said Brexit should not be used as an excuse to restrict the ability to have open markets and freedom of location.

"The roots exist to come out with sensible outcomes on this."

Some companies have already announced plans to move people to continental European locations to retain access to the EU single market. Bailey said a transition period based on current trading arrangements was needed this year.

This would avoid a "regrettable" situation whereby firms had to "press the button" on moves to the EU before they know what the outcome of Britain's negotiations with the bloc will be.

"It needs to be a sensible period," Bailey said.

Bailey questioned whether restricting trade in this way was an inevitable or necessary response to Brexit.

"When I hear people say firms need to re-locate in order to continue to benefit from access to EU financial markets, I start to seriously wonder."

NO LOCATION POLICIES

France and other EU countries, for example, want the clearing of euro denominated derivatives, which London dominates, "located" within the EU after Brexit.

"It does not require a location policy," Bailey said.

Joint oversight with the EU of clearing houses in London is "something that is very clearly preferable to the cost and risk that is introduced by a location based policy."

Such joint oversight was already working well between the UK and United States regulators in clearing, he said.

He dismissed talk in the EU that given the dominance of Britain's financial services sector, the largest in Europe, there should be specific rules for the UK, rather than the existing general regime for recognising non-EU financial firms.

"I do not accept that," Bailey said.

Non-EU financial firms from the United States, Singapore and elsewhere can currently offer their services in the EU if their home regulation is deemed by Brussels to be "equivalent" or as tough as the bloc's own rules.

This regime should be applied to Britain in the same way.

"It would not be the best outcome to adopt a special treatment for the oversight of outsourced service provision arrangements involving the UK and EU when there are already arrangements in place which can form the basis of an equivalence arrangement," Bailey said.

NO RACE TO THE BOTTOM

Britain was not interested in a "race to the bottom" in regulation after Brexit, he said.

Britain has worked hard over the years to build up relations with EU and national regulators across the bloc, he said, though he conceded that he was already being locked out of EU regulatory discussions about Brexit.

"It's perfectly reasonable ... It does not concern me."

There are already fears that asset managers in Britain will be prevented from managing funds based in the EU after Brexit, but Bailey said this longstanding cross-border "delegation" should continue.

"It works well today. There is no reason to disrupt that model," Bailey said.

Critics of Brexit have said that Britain will end up being a "rule taker", meaning it will have to copy and paste the bloc's rules into UK law if it wants to maintain access in financial services.

"I don't want to be in a situation where we become a pure rule taker," Bailey said.

Manchester City forward Gabriel Jesus is expected to miss this summer’s pre-season Manchester derby as he recovers from a fractured eye socket.

The first overseas clash between United and City will take place at the NRG Stadium in Houston, USA, on July 20.

But the Brazilian, who fractured his eye socket in an aerial challenge with club teammate Nicolas Otamendi during a friendly between Brazil and Argentina last month, is unlikely to feature.

Speaking in his native Brazil, Jesus told television channel Esp_Interativ that he expects to make his return in three weeks’ time.

The 19-year-old did, however, confirm that he won’t have to undergo an operation for the injury.

“I won't have to have an operation," he said. "I should be back within three weeks.

“Many thanks to all the fans for the support and love. Thanks to Dr Pagura and his team.”

Jesus missed two critical months at City last season after being sidelined with a fractured metatarsal.

The youngster returned, though, to see out the end of the Citizens’ campaign before picking up another injury in the friendly against Brazil at Melbourne Cricket Ground.

A new design for a building that dates back to the 1800's. Its now one of the largest exhibition spaces in London. The Victoria and Albert museum, or the V&A as its also known, has undergone a seventy million dollar upgrade. (SOUNDBITE) (English) DIRECTOR, VICTORIA AND ALBERT MUSEUM, TRISTRAM HUNT, SAYING: "Where we are standing was almost an old junkyard full of technical services and boiler rooms and what we've done then is create this living room for london which blends the street and the museum..." Called the 'Exhibition Road Quarter' it includes the Sackler Courtyard, Blavatnik Hall and the 1,100 square metre Sainsbury Gallery. (SOUNDBITE) (English) PRINCIPAL ARCHITECT, AL_A, AMANDA LEVETE, SAYING: "The big event of this project is the vast gallery space which is 18 metres below ground and therefore we have to descend deep underground to get that space and we wanted to make sure that that was a dramatic experience but that you also felt very comfortable." Architect Amanda Levete says there was pressure to preserve the V&A and still create something new. (SOUNDBITE) (English) PRINCIPAL ARCHITECT, AL_A, AMANDA LEVETE, SAYING: "...So while I felt the responsibility of history I also felt it was our responsibility to do something that was radical and contemporary and find a way of being both sensitive to history but very clear about the power of modernity." To celebrate the opening the V&A museum is putting on a free festival called 'REVEAL' from Friday 30 June to 7 July (2017).

BRUSSELS The European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier warned British ministers and businesses who are calling for "frictionless trade" with the EU after Britain leaves that that is "not possible".

Addressing an EU business forum in Brussels on Thursday, Barnier said London's "red lines" for a future trade relationship meant Britain was definitely leaving the single market and the customs union, and only membership of both allowed "frictionless" trading arrangements.

But Britain will stick by its aim to get a comprehensive free trade deal and customs agreement with the EU to ensure that trade is "as frictionless as possible" once it has left the bloc, a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said.

Barnier said he was unsure the EU's refusal to grant single market access piecemeal and insistence on control of standards in the single market "have been fully understood across the Channel".

"I have heard some people in the UK argue that one can leave the single market and keep all of its benefits - that is not possible," he said. "I have heard some people in the UK argue that one can leave the single market and build a customs union to achieve 'frictionless trade' – that is not possible."

Stressing that time was tight for a deal by the time Britain automatically leaves the bloc on March 30, 2019 - "time flies", he said. Barnier said he was ready to handle a failure of talks and "no deal" but that would be damaging, especially to Britain, and he saw "no reasonable justification" for it.

"A fair deal is far better than no deal," he said, turning around a phrase popularized by May that no deal is better than a bad deal.

He called for rapid agreement on priority issues in talks begun last month to build a "climate of trust" so that trade negotiations could begin as soon as possible. But in urging businesses to prepare for Brexit now, he stressed that whatever deal was done would carry "significant consequences".

"A trading relationship with a country that does not belong to the European Union obviously involves friction," Barnier said. He cited disruption to cross-border traders processing value-added tax (VAT) and a need for all EU imports of animals and animal products to be tested at borders.

Those issues are of particular concern in Ireland, where farming businesses on either side of the new UK-EU border on the island fear disruption. Barnier repeated EU willingness to make a priority of agreeing border issues on Ireland, where leaders on all sides fear a "hard" frontier could also undermine the fragile peace in the British province of Northern Ireland.

The EU's conclusion of a free trade deal with Japan on Thursday was hailed by EU leaders as a sign of what the combined economic power of the bloc can achieve - and of what Britain will miss when it leaves.

"In the context of the discussion about Brexit, we have heard statements claiming that it isn't worth being in the European Union, as it is easier to do global trade outside of the EU," European Council President Donald Tusk said.

"Today we have shown that this is not true," he said.

EU Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan said the deal which will open Japan to European high-value food and drink exports, "shows the importance of size in global trade negotiations".

"No individual member state could ever hope to achieve what the EU can achieve together," Hogan said.

The EU hopes it will take effect in early 2019, just when Britain is leaving. London, where Trade Secretary Liam Fox welcomed the EU-Japan deal, may seek to emulate its benefits for the likes of Britain's hugely valuable Scotch whisky exports.

Two women whose brother was murdered after a hate campaign from his neighbours tell how they lost faith in the system

There were two moments in particular when Mojgan Khayatian realised that the racism faced by her brother, Bijan Ebrahimi, went beyond the crude bigotry of individuals to the callous indifference of institutions.

The first came in 2007, after Ebrahimi’s flat in Bristol was set on fire while he was still in it. He survived and the council moved him. But before he left the first flat his sister came over to help him clean it up.

“The police arrived, grabbed Bijan and without any explanation put handcuffs on him,” explains Khayatian. “They said: ‘Someone reported that you were breaking into the flat.’ I explained to them that we were cleaning up but they wouldn’t listen. They were arresting him and it was only when a council officer came and told them the same thing that they took off the cuffs. But they didn’t say sorry. They just went away. That’s when I realised there was something not normal happening.”

The second moment came a month after Ebrahimi was beaten to death by one of his neighbours and then set on fire in July 2013. That was when the family realised that this systemic negligence would continue beyond the the grave. Khayatian and her sister, Manizhah Moores, went to lay flowers outside the flat accompanied by two liaison officers. They were still in the dark about what had happened to their brother and why the liaison officers would not tell them.

Bristol city council faces inquiry over handling of Bijan Ebrahimi Read more

“When we emptied his storage cupboard we decided to give away the belongings that had no sentimental value,” explains Khayatian. “The liaison officers knew what had happened, but they allowed us to give his things to the people who were the actual cause of his murder. After we found out we were disgusted with ourselves. When I discovered that, I lost all my faith in the system and I knew more was coming.”

That realisation sparked a tireless campaign over four years by the two sisters both to find out what happened to their younger brother and to make sure that the world knew. Revelations along the way led to the jailing of one police officer and one community support officer for misconduct in public office and the dismissal of two other constables.

Earlier this week that campaign reached a milestone when the police watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) issued a report saying that the police repeatedly failed to protect Ebrahimi even as he constantly alerted them to the violent, racially-motivated hate campaign he endured at the hands of his neighbours.

Ebrahimi was the youngest of the family, who took care of his ailing parents in Tehran. When they died he sought refugee status in Britain and, after a brief stay in Leicester, went to Bristol to be near his sisters. Medical problems both with his knees and with his spine left him disabled.



“We were over the moon when he came here,” says Khayatian. “There was a guilt inside us because he had looked after our parents and even though he was the cleverest he hadn’t been to university. So we wanted to relieve ourselves of this guilt. It gave us an opportunity to look after him, to cook for him and wash his clothes. To really be there for him.”

The abuse Ebrahimi faced on the housing estate where he lived was unrelenting. Some harassment was relatively petty. He loved his tabby cat, Mooshi, so they kicked it. He adored his flowers and plants so the neighbour who led a vendetta against him encouraged children to vandalise them. But some was far more serious.



They spread a rumour that he was a paedophile, threatened to run him over and threw rocks at his doors. A few days before he murdered Ebrahimi Lee James barged into his house and beat him up on the pretext that Ebrahimi was taking pictures of his daughters. Over six years Ebrahimi called the police 85 times.

“I only knew one in 10 things that happened to him there,” says Khayatian. “He tried to make sure I didn’t worry.”

But what came to light during the investigation was the degree to which both the police and the council chose to ignore his pleas or believed other tenants instead of him. In 2009 police described him as “a serial complainer about his neighbours and investigations always reveal informant to be the aggressor”. The day James burst into his house and headbutted him, Ebrahimi was arrested for breach of the peace.

It was this systemic, institutional neglect that the sisters took on. They also named it for what it was: racism – a term most official reports have shied away from, referring instead to an unspecified “hate crime”. In her foreword the IPPC commissioner, Jan Williams, writes: “Some of the evidence has the hallmarks of what could be construed as racial bias, conscious or unconscious.”

In a previously sealed consent order, seen by the Guardian, the chief constable of Avon and Somerset constabulary admits to both a breach of Ebrahimi’s rights under article two of the European convention on human rights for failing to protect his life, and a breach of his right not to be discriminated against on the grounds of race.

“Bijan was left defenceless against the race hatred of other tenants because the very institutions whose duty it was to protect him are infected with the same racism,” said Tony Murphy of Bhatt Murphy solicitors, which acted for the family.

They got this far, says Moores, because the authorities originally misjudged them. “They thought these two sisters were going to be fobbed off with a few words. We were not the foreigners that they thought. Maybe we can tell them what to believe and they will go away. But we fought for this. We were there all the time. Every meeting they asked us to go to. We read every report.”

And it’s not over. The sisters claim the council also failed Ebrahimi and they are calling it to account too. “The main reason the police thought this was because the council said that Bijan was the troublemaker,” explains Moores. “They could have moved him to a better place. But they blamed him for the trouble because he wasn’t white.”

“We knew their action was pure racism,” says Khayatian. “And that encouraged us to fight for it.”

Bristol’s elected mayor, Marvin Rees, said this was “a horrific case which highlighted the need for many things to change”. He said the city council was “very sorry for any shortcomings that are identified”.



Bijan Ebrahimi was always a persistent younger brother, says Khayatian. “If we were playing some kind of game, and he thought he had the right answer, he was the kind of boy who would have continued researching more, to prove his point. He was very determined. If he believed something was right. He would stand by it. Everything that happened to him did make him more withdrawn but he never lost his spirit.”

It is this tenacity that comes through when reading the official reports. That somehow, even as the neighbours abused him, the police force either neglected or targeted him, and the council maligned him, he continued to insist both on his humanity and his rights.

In her foreword, Williams notes: “The most salutary lesson for the constabulary is underlined by the sad poignant fact that Bijan Ebrahimi kept faith with the police throughout. The Avon and Somerset constabulary misconduct panel noted that he remained respectful, cooperative and calm, if at times tearful. He was persistent in arguing his case, but nevertheless polite. Under extreme stress and provocation, at no point did he descend to profanity, to insult, to abuse. He never ceded dignity.”

The latest in our series where we turn the tables on the torturers. Under the spotlight this time is John Dawson, AKA Chifonie

Chifonie has been setting cryptics for the Guardian since 1994; he also sets for the Financial Times as Armonie and has posed fiendish barred-grid challenges as Symphonia. He can be devious in a way that is frequently funny and always fair; for example, the clue “Deer takes one for a ride (4)”. So, let’s meet the setter.

When did you get the crossword bug?

In 1971, I was working in a laboratory in Birmingham and during our tea and lunch breaks, a group collected around a copy of the Telegraph and solved its crossword collectively.

I soon started attempting the Guardian puzzle at home on my own, but the first time I completed it without assistance was while queuing outside the British Museum for three hours to see the Tutankhamun exhibition. That was a red-letter day in more ways than one.

How did you choose your pseudonyms?

Music means a great deal to me and at the time my first puzzles were being published I was listening to a lot of early music in which the hurdy-gurdy is often featured. There are many different names for this instrument and I chose to use three of them, Armonie, Chifonie and Symphonia.

Where do you create your puzzles?

In my living room, switching between an easy chair surrounded by reference books and sitting at my computer accessing its reference works and writing my clues. When the mood takes me, I can look out of the window across the town to Kendal Castle and the fells beyond.

That sounds heavenly. What’s your favourite of your own clues or puzzles?

I have to trust other people’s judgment for my best clues. Hugh Stephenson’s favourite is:

Saw dog wearing lead (7)

And David Astle, writer of the book Puzzled, likes:

Fool starts to imagine death is only temporary (5)

The first, I note, is also in the introduction to Chambers Crossword Dictionary. What are the tools of your trade?

I have a great battery of aids, both reference books and computer programs, to help create my puzzles. I use them to help me write better clues rather than save time.

How does setting for the quick differ from an authored puzzle?

For quicks I look for words or phrases that have straightforward definitions. For cryptics I look for words that easily split into components for the cryptic part of the clue.

What makes a successful clue?

One that puzzles me at first but with an answer that seems glaringly obvious once I have it.

Name another setter whose work you admire.

I was always a fan of Alec Robins, Custos in the Guardian. His puzzles were entertaining although not difficult. It was only when I started writing my own clues that I realised how precise and elegantly constructed his were.

Tell us about lakedistrictwalks.com.

When I first joined the internet in 1996, I was intrigued by the design of websites and wanted to see whether I could create one myself. As I used to do a lot of fellwalking that seemed to be a good topic and so I started the site. Other walkers gave me a lot of encouragement and the website just grew.

How do people respond when you tell them that you’re a crossword setter?

Most say they don’t do crosswords, most are intrigued – and occasionally they are fans. I once got chatting to a French student while walking back to Grasmere after an enjoyable day on the fells and he asked what I did for a living. When I explained, he said he enjoyed meeting people with interesting jobs. I asked him what he was studying. “The trapeze,” he replied.

Finally, if you weren’t setting crosswords, what would you be doing?

The world is full of things that spark my interest. When I was a child I was taken to dancing classes: very unusual for a lad in a mining village. I stopped dancing in my teens and only started again recently. After struggling to find a ballroom partner who wanted to improve rather than dance just for fun, I finally met someone of like mind and a year ago we started competing in the National League.

We dance about four times a week, which we both feel is enough, so what else would I do? When I lived in London I went to a lot of concerts on South Bank and at the Albert Hall. I miss that and so would probably spend the extra time going to concerts either in Manchester or locally. Walking the Lakeland fells would still be a draw for me, too.



Many thanks to Chifonie and good luck with the National League. The answers to the clues above are DOES (double definition), PROVERB (ROVER inside the chemical symbol Pb) and IDIOT (an acrostic).

Everyone's got a story about how they thought a certain friend was mean the first time they met, but realised later that he or she is actually the nicest person ever.

Generally, you've only got a few seconds to make someone want to spend more time with you. Everything matters — from your last name to the smell of your sweat (gross, we know).

Below, Business Insider rounded up various scientific findings on the traits and behaviours that make people dislike you, both online and in person.

1. Sharing too many photos on Facebook

If you're the kind of person who shares snapshots of your honeymoon, cousin's graduation, and dog dressed in a Halloween costume all in the same day, you might want to stop.

A 2013 study found that posting too many photos on Facebook can hurt your real-life relationships.

"This is because people, other than very close friends and relatives, don't seem to relate well to those who constantly share photos of themselves," lead study author David Houghton, of Birmingham Business School, said in a release.

Specifically, friends don't like it when you've got too many photos of family, and relatives don't like it when you've got too many photos of friends.

Ben Marder, of the University of Edinburgh, also worked on the study, and warned: "Be cautious when sharing and think how it will be perceived by all the others who may see it. Although sharing is a great way to better relationships, it can also damage them."

2. Having too many, or too few, Facebook friends

In a 2008 study, Michigan State University researchers asked college students to look at fictional Facebook profiles and decide how much they liked the profiles' owners.

Results showed that the "sweet spot" for likability was about 300 friends. Likability ratings were lowest when a profile owner had only about 100 friends, and almost as low when they had more than 300 friends.

As for why 300-plus friends could be a turn-off, the study authors write, "Individuals with too many friends may appear to be focusing too much on Facebook, friending out of desperation rather than popularity."

On the other hand, the college students doing the evaluation each had about 300 Facebook friends themselves. So the researchers acknowledge that in a population where the most common number of Facebook friends is 1,000, the sweet spot for likability could be 1,000.

Keep in mind, though, that a 2014 survey found that the average number of Facebook friends among adult users was 338.

Interestingly, the study also suggested that participants weren't consciously aware that they liked people less when they had too many or too few Facebook friends.

3. Disclosing something extremely personal early on in a relationship

In general, people like each other more after they've traded confidences. Self-disclosure is one of the best ways to make friends as an adult.

But psychologists say that disclosing something too intimate — say, that your sister is having an extramarital affair — while you're still getting to know someone can make you seem insecure and decrease your likability.

The key is to get just the right amount of personal. As a 2013 study led by Susan Sprecher at Illinois State University suggests, simply sharing details about your hobbies and your favorite childhood memories can make you seem warmer and more likable.

4. Asking someone questions without talking about yourself at all

That same 2013 study by found an important caveat to the idea that self-disclosure predicts closeness: It has to be mutual. People generally like you less if you don't reciprocate when they disclose something intimate.

In the study, unacquainted participants either engaged in back-and-forth self-disclosure or took turns self-disclosing for 12 minutes each while the other listened. Results showed that participants in the back-and-forth group liked each other significantly more.

As the authors write, "Although shy or socially anxious people may ask questions of the other to detract attention from themselves, our research shows that this is not a good strategy for relationship initiation. Both participants in an interaction need to disclose to generate mutual closeness and liking."

5. Posting a close-up profile photo

If your LinkedIn profile features an image of your face practically smushed up against the camera, you'd be wise to change it.

Research from California Institute of Technology suggests that faces photographed from just 45 centimeters — about 1.5 feet — away are considered less trustworthy, attractive, and competent than faces photographed from 135 centimeters, about 4.5 feet, away.

6. Hiding your emotions

Research suggests that letting your real feelings come through is a better strategy for getting people to like you than bottling it all up.

In one 2016 study, University of Oregon researchers videotaped people watching two movie scenes: the fake-orgasm part of the movie "When Harry Met Sally" and a sad scene from "The Champ." In some cases, the actors were instructed to react naturally; in another they were instructed to suppress their emotions.

College students then watched the four versions of the videos. Researchers measured how much interest the students expressed in befriending the people in the videos, as well as their assessments of the personalities of the people in the videos.

Results showed that suppressors were judged less likable — as well as less extroverted and agreeable — than people who emoted naturally.

The researchers write: "People … do not pursue close relationships indiscriminately — they probably look for people who are likely to reciprocate their investments. So when perceivers detect that someone is hiding their emotions, they may interpret that as a disinterest in the things that emotional expression facilitates — closeness, social support, and interpersonal coordination."

7. Acting too nice

It makes logical sense that the nicer and more altruistic you seem, the more people will like you. But some science suggests otherwise.

In a 2010 study, researchers at Washington State University and the Desert Research Institute had college students play a computer game with four other players, who were really manipulations by the researchers.

Here's how one of the study authors explained the study procedure in The Harvard Business Review:

"Each participant was placed in a five-person group, but did not see its other members. Each was given endowments that they could in their turn choose to keep or return, in whole or in part. There was some incentive to maximize one’s holdings, but not an obvious one.

"(The participants were told that, at the end of the semester, a random drawing of their names would be held and those few who were chosen would have their holdings converted to Dining Services coupons redeemable at campus eateries.)"

Some of the fake participants would give up lots of points and only take a few vouchers — a rather altruistic behavior. As it turns out, most participants said they wouldn't want to work with their unselfish teammate again.

In a similar, follow-up experiment in the same study, some said the unselfish teammate made them look bad; others suspected they had ulterior motives.

8. Humblebragging

In an effort to impress friends and potential employers, some people disguise bragging as self-criticism. This behavior, otherwise known as "humblebragging," could be a turn-off, according to a recent study from Harvard Business School.

In the study, college students were asked to write down how they'd answer a question about their biggest weakness in a job interview. Results showed that more than three-quarters of participants humblebragged, usually about being a perfectionist or working too hard.

Yet independent research assistants said they'd be more likely to hire the participants who were honest, and found them significantly more likable. Those students said things like, "I'm not always the best at staying organized" and "Sometimes I overreact to situations."

Another alternative in a job-interview situation is to talk about weaknesses that don't directly relate to the position — for example, a fear of public speaking if you're applying for a writing position.

9. Getting too nervous

Never let 'em see — or smell — you sweat. Research suggests that the odor of your nervous sweat may subconsciously influence people's judgments of your personality.

In 2013, researchers at the Monell Chemical Senses Center had participants watch videos of women in everyday situations, like working in an office and taking care of a child. While watching the videos, they sniffed three kinds of sweat: sweat that someone had produced while exercising, sweat produced during a stressful situation, and sweat produced during a stressful situation that had been covered up with antiperspirant.

Participants were then asked to rate the women on how competent, confident, and trustworthy they seemed.

Results showed that participants rated the women lower on all measures when they smelled the stress-induced sweat. When they smelled the stress sweat that had been covered up with antiperspirant, they rated the women more positively.

10. Not smiling

When you're at a networking event and meeting lots of new people, it can be hard to keep a smile plastered on your face. Try anyway.

In a University of Wyoming study, nearly 100 undergraduate women looked at photos of another woman in one of four poses: smiling in an open body position, smiling in a closed body position, not smiling in an open body position, or not smiling in a closed body position. Results showed that the woman in the photo was liked most when she was smiling, regardless of her body position.

More recently, researchers at Stanford University and the University of Duisburg-Essen found that students who interacted with each other through avatars felt more positively about the interaction when the avatar displayed a bigger smile.

Bonus: Another study found that smiling when you first meet someone helps ensure that they'll remember you later.

11. Acting like you don't like someone

Psychologists have known for a while about a phenomenon called "reciprocity of liking": When we think someone likes us, we tend to like them as well.

In a 1959 study published In Human Relations, for example, participants were told that certain members of a group discussion would probably like them. (These group members were chosen randomly by the experimenter.) After the discussion, participants indicated that the people they liked best were the ones who supposedly liked them.

More recently, researchers at the University of Waterloo and the University of Manitoba found that when we expect people to accept us, we act warmer toward them — thereby increasing the chances that they really will like us. So even if you're not sure how a person you're interacting with feels about you, act like you like them and they'll probably like you back.

If, on the other hand, you don't express fondness for the person you're meeting, you could potentially turn them off.

12. Having a hard-to-pronounce name

We know: This one's really not fair.

But here's the science: A 2012 study, by researchers at the University of Melbourne, the University of Leuven, and New York University, found that people with more complicated last names are judged more negatively.

In one experiment included in the study, undergraduate participants read a mock newspaper article about a man running for an upcoming local council election. Some participants read about a man with a relatively easy-to-pronounce last name (Lazaridis or Paradowska); others read about a man with a harder-to-pronounce name (Vougiouklakis and Leszczynska).

As it turns out, participants who'd read about the man with the simpler name said that candidate was a better fit for the government position than participants who'd read about the man with the more complicated name.

13. Name-dropping

It can be tempting to mention that famous author who graduated from your alma mater in order to impress your conversation partner. But the tactic can backfire.

That's according to researchers at the University of Zurich. In 2009, they published a paper suggesting that name-dropping makes people seem both less likable and less competent.

For the study, University of Zurich students interacted with "partners" via email (the emails had really been generated by the researchers).

In some emails, the partner mentioned that Roger Federer was his friend and that they'd worked out together. In other emails, the partner only mentioned that Federer was a friend. In another set of emails, the partner mentioned that he or she was a fan of Federer. And in some emails, the partner didn't mention Federer at all.

Results showed that the stronger the supposed association between the partner and Federer, the less participants liked their partner. The researchers found that was largely because participants felt their partners were manipulative.

Team Sky's attempts to present a united front in the face of an escalating crisis appear to have backfired after triple Tour de France winner Chris Froome failed to back Sir Dave Brailsford amid rumours about his future as team principal.

With the team's reputation in "tatters" following a UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) investigation and a series of damaging sessions in front of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, Cycling News website reports that riders are considering asking the coach to resign.

According to the site, with Brailsford "at the centre of a major controversy over the team's medical practices", several riders have "held discussions" over whether to ask him to step down.

"According to a source among the riders, the continued questions over the team's credibility have started to impact on performance," it says.

Following the claim, riders including Geraint Thomas and Luke Rowe took to Twitter to stand up for Brailsford - but the story soon took another twist when it was suggested they may have been following team orders.

Couldn't of said it better myself. I'm 100% behind Dave! https://t.co/hCwMSru3R2 — Luke Rowe (@LukeRowe1990) March 6, 2017

"The crisis around Team Sky showed no signs of abating last night as riders were urged to tweet support for Sir Dave Brailsford," says Matt Dickinson in The Times. "But Chris Froome, the three-times Tour de France winner, was notable by his silence."

Tom Cary in the Daily Telegraph says riders had been urged to "show public support" amid fears that Team Sky faces "oblivion".

He adds: "Brailsford, the mastermind behind the enormous success of both British Cycling and Team Sky over the past decade, is under immense pressure following revelations concerning UK Anti-Doping’s drugs probe into both organisations."

Nicole Sapstead, the chief executive of Ukad, last week told MPs investigators had met "resistance" from Team Sky and British Cycling and they "could not establish the contents of the infamous Jiffy bag flown out to Sir Bradley Wiggins in 2011, and that there had been a shocking lack of medical record-keeping which raised worrying questions", adds the Telegraph.

Froome's failure to back his boss is the latest blow for Brailsford, who was urged to quit by William Fotheringham in The Observer on Sunday.

He argued the coach's position was "shaky" after it emerged Wiggins had used therapeutic use exemptions, became "untenable" when he was forced to address the issue of the Jiffy bag sent across Europe to Wiggins in 2011, and was now "impossible" after the events of the past week.

Fotheringham will not have been surprised by Froome's Twitter silence – he interviewed the cyclist in January and says "his backing for his boss did not even match that of a prime minister about to throw a chancellor to the men in suits".

Team Sky and British Cycling stripped of all credibility

The credibility of Team Sky and British Cycling is in "tatters" and its funding in doubt after another bruising day of evidence to the Culture Media and Sport select committee. During the session, UK Anti-Doping chief executive Nicole Sapstead revealed that the team had no records of what drugs were given to riders.

The day began with cycling coach Simon Cope, the man who transported the notorious jiffy bag apparently containing an over-the-counter medication halfway across Europe to Bradley Wiggins, joking that he sometimes fiddled his expenses.

Cope admitted he had no idea what was in the package and agreed that he had been "hung out to dry" by his superiors. But Sapstead, who has overseen a five-month investigation into Team Sky and British Cycling, is the "demolition agent" who destroyed the reputation of British Cycling and Team Sky, says William Fotheringham of The Guardian.

Yesterday's evidence was devastating. "By the end of an extraordinary session of damaging revelations, fraudulent expenses were the least of cycling's problems," says Matt Dickinson of The Times. "This became a horrendous afternoon when a doctor's professional reputation was battered, medical practices at British Cycling and Team Sky exposed as chaotic and compromised, and a new cloud of suspicion placed over the ethics of both organisations.

"And still Sir Bradley Wiggins was saying no comment even though he is the rider at the heart of it all, the cause of this storm with his three controversial injections for triamcinolone and the medical package delivered to him and Dr Richard Freeman in June 2011."

Team Sky's aim when it was set up in 2009 was to prove that cycling races could be won "clean", says Fotheringham of the Guardian. Against that backdrop, Sapstead said it was unfortunate that the team had no records of what medicines its doctor, Richard Freeman, administered to his athletes. The only documentation was on his laptop, which was stolen in 2014, she was told.

She described the situation as "odd". But "that was an understatement," says Fotheringham. "There have been no positive drug tests, so according to the letter of the law the mission has been achieved, but there has been a persistent, gradual erosion of the team's credibility."

Committee chairman Damian Collins said British Cycling and Team Sky's reputation was in "tatters" following the evidence of Cope and Sapstead.

And there could be repercussions. UK Sport chief executive Liz Nicholl said the lack of record keeping at British Cycling and Team Sky was “shocking”. She threatened to withdraw funding for the next Olympic cycle "unless it gets its house in order", reports the Daily Telegraph.

"British Cycling's new chairman, Jonathan Browning, agreed with her that the evidence heard by MPs was 'unacceptable' and said his organisation would carry out a thorough review of its medical practices," adds the paper.

That may not be the end of it. There are claims the General Medical Council could also get involved as the absence of records breaches its guidelines.

Fabio Fognini is temperamental and doesn’t have the best record on grass – and yet he is dangerous when underestimated. The enigmatic Italian will face Andy Murray in the third round at Wimbledon, hoping to pull one of the greatest upsets of this year’s Championships.

Married to former WTA No.1 Flavia Pentta, the 30-year-old Italian has not achieved as much as his wife during his career. He has never broken into the top 10 of the ATP rankings – peaking at No 13 in 2014 – and his best performance at a grand slam remain a run to the quarter-finals of the French Open in 2011.

But the Italian is a dangerous opponent. He is also an accomplished doubles player, winning the Australian Open in 2015 with his fellow Italian Simone Bolelli, and reaching the semi-finals of the US Open in 2011, and the French Open in 2015.

Murray knows the Italian well as Fognini has managed to upset Murray three times in his career, with the current head-to-head record between the two men locked at 3-3. The last time they played it was Fognini who triumphed, blowing the Scot off the court at the Rome Masters in an impressive 6-2 6-2 win.

In that match he hit a total of 31 winners on his favoured surface of clay, winning the first set in a positively breezy 40 minutes. He made barely any errors and smashed a large number of winners past the World No 1.

Most of those winners were off his mighty forehand, which is arguably his most dangerous weapon. He is quick on the court and excels at baseline play. However, his serve can lack power, with Murray likely to attack his second serve on Wednesday.

Wimbledon Day Three: Murray makes it four Brits into the third round

Theoretically at least, Fognini isn’t a terrible match-up for Murray, as the Scot is one of the finest defensive players in the game and is also an accomplished returner.

The surface should also work in Murray’s favour. All of Fognini’s victories over Murray have come on clay, while the Scot counts grass as his favourite surface. It will give him a considerable advantage on Wednesday.

Murray looks to have recovered from the hip injury he sustained in the build-up to the tournament and made light work of Dustin Brown in the previous round. The German was powerless against Murray and won just 14 points off his serve.

Murray’s consistency could frustrate Fognini, who is known to have something of a short temper. He is also prone to making silly mistakes and holds a record for the number of foot faults committed in a match.

Nevertheless, Fognini says he is ready for the third-round clash and his flair means he is definitely one to watch out for. To make sure of victory, Murray has to make sure he does not allow Fognini to dictate play, and must be wary of the Italian drop-shotting him in an attempt to punish his relative lack of match-fitness.

LONDON It's lonely at the top for British Prime Minister Theresa May but she's holding on -- for now.

May faced calls to quit from inside and outside her ruling Conservative Party after losing its parliamentary majority in an ill-judged election that she did not need to call, plunging Britain into the worst political instability for decades.

She has struggled since then to unite her government on policy and to assemble a new team of aides -- one Conservative lawmaker described it as "career suicide" to agree to serve a leader whose days in office may be numbered.

But party sources say moves to oust May are now on hold after senior figures agreed she should be the one to at least make a start on two years of Brexit talks that are likely to stretch her government and possibly the public's patience, giving the world's fifth biggest economy some breathing space.

READ MORE: Labour calls on government to drop European court red line

If she fails to make headway or satisfy some of her more eurosceptic party members, then she can answer for it, the party sources said.

"She'll stay for as long as we want her to," one lawmaker told Reuters, on condition of anonymity. "Now is not that time."

Concerns over the reaction of Britons if asked to vote for the fourth time in just over two years, over losing Conservative seats and of having someone else take over the lead in talks with the European Union have calmed calls to replace May.

Even the most embittered lawmakers say a new leadership vote would simply deepen divisions in the party over Brexit and its austerity agenda, blamed by opposition politicians for a devastating fire in west London that killed at least 80 people and for straining a police service battling militant attacks.

May, 60, has said she will carry on, despite her pride being "shattered" by the election, said one veteran Conservative Party member who spoke on condition of anonymity.

READ MORE: Northern Ireland parties fail to strike power-sharing deal, talks to continue

"But I suspect her sense of duty is bigger than (predecessor David) Cameron's," the source said. "No one actually wants the job, well they do want the job but not now."

CLEARING UP THE "MESS"

May, Britain's longest serving interior minister in over a century with a reputation as a tough and diligent politician, became the country's second female premier after Margaret Thatcher when Cameron resigned after Britons voted for Brexit.

Her path then was cleared when two other hopefuls -- her now foreign minister Boris Johnson and environment minister Michael Gove - all but killed off each others' bids and she appealed to members with her straight-talking can-do attitude.

But her boast that she could never be found "drinking in parliament's bars" may come to haunt her - having not been part of one of the Conservative cliques, she is very much alone as others in the party plot their routes to power.

The veteran source said her pledge to clear up "the mess" she created by staging the June 8 election had softened many Conservatives, who have traditionally punished leaders over any sign of weakness.

They are also driven by self-preservation. The election revealed the shortcomings of Conservative Campaign Headquarters and some Conservatives say it is time to take stock and restructure before the next election after Jeremy Corbyn's opposition Labour Party leapt in opinion polls.

"We need to get campaigning again properly, get the message out," the lawmaker said.

"We have spent years mopping up the mess left by Labour and now we are opening the door to Corbyn. The country will go bankrupt if he gets in and it'll take us 20 years to get back."

MAY IN RETREAT

May has promised to promote reform in the party, but forced to accept the resignations of her two closest aides and a steady departure of senior members of her Downing Street office team, her control is draining away.

Appointed shortly after Britain voted to leave the European Union, May ran a tight ship for months - giving little away, she tried to limit leaks by keeping some of her more publicity hungry ministers in check and sticking to the party line.

Now, they have been let off the leash.

Differences over Brexit strategy and a pay cap on public sector workers are aired almost daily while the prime minister's projects to bring in more selective schools and give lawmakers a vote on lifting a ban on fox hunting have been dropped.

May, it seems, has retreated.

"Before she could say you're not going on TV ... But now she can't crack the whip like a prime minister normally does," the veteran Conservative said.

She has reverted to type, the source said, of the "quiet girl in class who just got on with her homework", allowing her ministers such as Chancellor Phillip Hammond to take some of the limelight and a more commanding role.

For now, despite differences, her team of senior ministers is at least pulling in the same broad direction, towards a clean break with the European Union that sees Britain out of the bloc's single market to prioritise controlling immigration.

"It's a bit like a rowing boat, where everyone is pulling at different speeds, but not hard enough to topple it over," the veteran Conservative said.

"It's loud and it's messy, but it's actually democracy."

Trump again demands more NATO spending, mulls 'severe things' on North Korea

WARSAW U.S. President Donald Trump once more urged NATO allies in Europe on Thursday to spend more on defence, on a visit to Poland that had been billed as an opportunity for him to patch up relations after a tense alliance summit in May.

HONG KONG Tencent Holdings' (0700.HK) online publishing subsidiary has sought a waiver from Hong Kong listing rules to allow it to withhold shareholding information of some executives, drawing criticism from corporate governance advocates.

China Literature Ltd requested the unusual exemption from the Hong Kong bourse, saying revealing the three executives' stakes "would attract unnecessary attention amongst Tencent's employees and would likely create an unfavorable and political working environment which would significantly distort Tencent's workplace culture and distract them from their business duties within [Tencent] as well as their duties as directors of our

Company."

The online publisher filed for a Hong Kong IPO on Monday. The three executives are its board members and would have to disclose their stakes in Tencent as per the city's listing rules. The waiver request will now be vetted by the listing committee of the Hong Kong stock exchange.

"That's an outrageous waiver request, and I hope that the listing committee will reject it," said David Webb, Hong Kong's leading investor activist and a former director of the Hong Kong stock exchange. "It is the thin end of a nasty wedge if the listing committee allows companies not to disclose directors' shareholdings in their parent company."

Jamie Allen, secretary general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association, said it would set a bad precedent to grant the exception.

Tencent, China Literature and the Hong Kong bourse didn't immediately reply to Reuters requests for comment.

China Literature asked for a waiver so it doesn't have to reveal the stakes held in Tencent by James Gordon Mitchell, a former Goldman Sachs banker and Tencent's chief strategy officer; Cheng Wu, CEO of Tencent Pictures; and Lin Haifeng, general manager of the merger and acquisitions department at Tencent Science & Technology (Shenzhen) Co.

The three are non-executive directors in China Literature's nine-member board, with Mitchell also acting as chairman.

They hold "an insignificant percentage of share capital" in Tencent, the filing added. But with a market capitalization of nearly $330 billion, even a tiny stake in China's biggest social network and online entertainment firm would make the executives multi-millionaires.

In its 2016 annual report Tencent disclosed the stakes held by Chairman Ma Huateng, also known as Pony Ma, President Lau Chi Ping Martin, or Martin Lau, and four independent non-executive directors. The value of the stakes ranged from $29 billion for Ma to as low as $126,348 for one of the independent directors.

As in most markets, shareholders owning 5 percent or more of any stock must be disclosed to the Hong Kong stock exchange and under listing rules IPO candidates must also reveal the interests and short positions their board directors hold in the issuer itself or "associated corporations."

Publicly listed companies must also disclose the interests and short positions of their CEOs and all directors in shares and debentures in the companies themselves or associated corporations under a separate rule, the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO).

That means even if China Literature were granted the waiver, it would still have to reveal the stakes at a later date.

"The listing committee has no powers to waive SFO obligations, so as soon as the company is listed, they would have to file disclosures, which will be available to the public," investor Webb added. "So not including them in the prospectus would only delay disclosure."

For 1.8 billion young people, family planning will be vital in shaping lives and livelihoods. As leaders prepare for the London Family Planning Summit, Lucy Lamble looks at the challenges ahead

LL Lucy Lamble

BS Beth Schlachter

JB Julia Bunting

LF Liz Ford

AK Ali Kaviri

AKM Annet Kyarimpa Mukabe

AN Annet Nabizzizzi

LL There are currently an estimated 1.8 billion young people in the world; the biggest cohort of young people ever, with nearly nine out of 10 of them living in developing countries. In 2012, London hosted a summit that set the agenda for family planning up to 2020. For a long time adolescents have not featured prominently on the development agenda, but increasingly there’s a realisation that their futures depend on being able to plan their families.



Preview clip from Uganda report So if we are not giving information to young boys and girls, then they don’t get the knowledge and empowerment they need to make great decisions. And of course, it affects the livelihood of the girl and the babies that they’re giving birth to.

LL In 2016 alone, 82m unintended pregnancies, 25m unsafe abortions and 124,000 maternal deaths were averted due to the use of modern effective methods of family planning. But despite this many people in the world still can’t count on access to contraception, and now many countries are about to face additional problems as the US cuts funding.

Rich countries pledge $2.6bn for family planning in global south Read more

I’m Lucy Lamble and this month on the Global development podcast ahead of the second London Family Planning Summit, we’re looking at how these challenges will affect the growing population of young people in the developing world and consequently the economy of their countries.

At the 2012 London summit, some of the world’s richer countries pledged $2.6bn over the next eight years and FP2020 was set up to monitor that promise. Beth Schlachter is their executive director.

BS In 2012, building on the excitement from the London summit, the global community set the goal of expanding access to contraception so that 120 million additional women and girls in the world’s 69 lowest income countries would be able to use contraception. And by that we mean that they would have access to a range of high quality products, that they would have healthcare services that consider their needs and are based on high quality information, on counselling sessions that really work with women to determine what their needs are and what would best suit their purposes.

LL Julia Bunting is from the Population Council.

JB When you give a woman or a young person the right to determine freely and for themselves whether, when and how many children to have, then their life chances are transformed. They don’t have unintended pregnancies, they’re not at much risk of unsafe abortions and maternal mortality. We see that they choose to have fewer children and to invest more in those children. So those children have greater life chances; they’re likely to be more healthy, they have more years of education and they’re more likely to be productive in the labour force.

And when we see this happen at an aggregate level – the choices of many individuals happening – then we see real benefits for countries in terms of their economic growth and development as well as things like security and stability.

LL That’s what’s known as the demographic dividend. How does that work?

JB The demographic dividend is a phenomenon that occurs when there is increased access to contraception that leads to reductions in fertility and that creates a change in the population age structure. So what we see is that there are fewer young people and more people of working age. And when we get that dependency ratio the number of young people to working age people when that reduces what we see is a real opportunity for economic growth because there are more people working.

Now for that to come to be, it’s not just that you need to increase access to contraception, you also need to increase human capital, improve people’s health and education, and you need to implement policies around labour and employment and trade.

And the demographic dividend is a very real phenomenon. We’ve seen it happening in countries around the world. So if you just take some of the examples, for example, the Asian tigers – the east Asian tigers countries like South Korea and Taiwan and Singapore – they experienced the demographic dividend between the late 1960s and the 1990s, and the economic miracle that we saw in those countries was in part a result of these investments. And they estimate that about a third of that economic growth was a result of harnessing the demographic dividend.

LL FP2020 publishes a report every year looking at the progress across the 69 countries they target.

BS Where we’ve seen considerable progress is in a lot of the difficult work that has to take place for governments to provide programmes to meet the needs of their citizens. So a lot of the work that we do as well is around social norms and around expanding the understanding within communities for why women should have access to products that give them control over the most intimate part of their lives. So we do a lot of work to help women understand what contraception is; to help communities support women having access to that, with the understanding that is women have more autonomy as they have healthier lives, as they have healthier children at birth and that they’re able to support them through early childhood, that we then have healthier families, stronger economics in local communities and potential for growth overall economically in countries.

'Global gag rule': stop playing politics with women's lives, MSF tells Trump Read more

So family planning is one of those interesting areas of work where both human rights and economics come together in a really interesting and challenging way. So we have to look at both sides of it, both the technical, the bureaucratic, the delivery side as well as the human side of healthcare and need for individual people.

LL Global development deputy editor Liz Ford travelled to Uganda where sex education is under great pressure.

AK So my name is Ali Kaviri. I’m a youth rights and women’s campaigner in Uganda. A Women Deliver young leader and I’m also the World Contraception Day ambassador for Uganda.

LF What about sex education in Uganda, is it taught in schools?

AK I will give you my experience. Like I only gotten about sex education maybe just a few phrases during biology lessons, where we draw the female reproductive organ. Where we would draw a female reproductive system, a male reproductive system and then have discussions and all that.

But in terms of sexuality education, or comprehensive sexuality education, right now they don’t even have this conversation, it’s banned. That means organisations cannot even take this message to young people. Young people now are just wondering on their own.

LL In Uganda, many believe that young people should not be educated about sex but instead be taught to abstain. Yet, adolescents are having sex. According to the country’s 2016 Demographic and Health survey, a quarter of girls aged 15 to 19 have had a baby or are pregnant. Annet Kyarimpa Mukabe is coordinator of safe motherhood with Reproductive Health Uganda.

AKM Uganda has one of the highest teenage pregnancies in the world, estimated at 25%. And one of the contributing factors is lack of access to family planning, cultural and traditional barriers that inhibit young girls from talking about sexuality issues. But also the environment in which young people access sexual and reproductive health services is not very conducive.

Uganda fails to target gay men and sex workers in fast-track HIV initiative Read more

LL Annet Nabizzizzi is a volunteer for Reproductive Health Uganda in Mbale.

AN I dropped from school because of unwanted pregnancy. I am a mother through very painful condition. I was 16 years, I gave birth at 17 years. I feel so bad for the young ones, the young girls. At least I counsel … I try to counsel them not to be like me.

LF So, Annet, if your 15-year-old daughter came up to you and wanted to talk to you or ask about taking contraception what would you say, or what would you do?

AN I first counsel her. But if she do insist I give the [contraceptives].

LF How would you feel about giving her something like that?

AN I feel very bad. I feel bad. I feel bad because early sex is not good.

LF But what would compel you to give her what she wanted?

AN Because she might get pregnant when she’s still in school.

AK What now this means for us as young people and especially with saying a lot in terms of increasing access to information so you can make informed choices in life, we’re going to see many young girls you know deferred. We’re going to have so many, let’s say, girls drop out of school due to pregnancy-related cases, due to child marriages, due to quite a number of things. And that means it has a bearing of course to the economy. That means you’re having child families that cannot be able to support and our people shall continue to live in poverty for many years to come.

LL In January this year, President Trump reinstated the Mexico City policy – also known as the “global gag rule”, which bars any overseas organisation receiving US aid from mentioning abortion in their work. In April, the US administration also cut funding to the United Nations Population Fund. Julia Bunting again.

JB We actually had decades of evidence around what works in family planning and decades of evidence that really shows the many and multiple benefits. It’s absolutely clear that the decision being put forward by the Trump administration to reduce their commitment to international family planning but to broader to health and development are going to be devastating. We know that when the Mexico City policy has been enacted in the past – under previous Republican administrations – that it’s led to reductions in services and to closures in clinics. And this version under President Trump is even bigger than that. We’re talking now about dramatic reductions in funding, not just in family planning but also across global health and development. And we expect that the results will be devastating for women and men and young people around the world.

LL Uganda may well be one of the countries affected.

AK I also happen to be a chair of the African Youth and Adolescent Network on Population Development, which is largely connected by UNFPA. And there’s a lot of support that we are receiving from UNFPA that is aimed at reaching out to youth groups ensuring that we have access to family planning information and services, to ensure that there is support for our comprehensive sexuality education, support aimed at saving mothers from dying, saving young mothers contracting fistula and so many other issues. So, that alone has a very big impact on women’s reproductive choices and it’s going to affect especially young people in Uganda that are heavily affected in this country.

LL The US announcement leaves a big funding gap, which means that national governments will now have to think hard about prioritising family planning in their budgets.

BS What we’re going to have to do is also see if our development partners in countries can do more as well to meet some of their need. UNFPA provides contraceptives in a number of countries but they also provide technical assistance and that’s where we really need to make sure that people on the ground to help developing countries to build their capacities, to expand their own programmes. So it’s those partnerships and efficiencies they’re in that are one of the areas that we’re going to have to look at in order to be able to maintain the programmes we have and to grow them for the future.

LL How are people on the ground going to get round this? Ali Kaviri again.

AK Through the Women Deliver programme and particularly through the World Contraception Day project that’s potentially between Women Deliver and Bayer, together with youth advocates, are being supported to launch a maiden, sort of, platform in this country. And that’s the Youth SRHR website. You can access it online. We are trying to ease information access to young people.

We have a broadcast radio, which is integrated with the website, and it’s purely broadcasting information around family planning. There’s a page where you can learn basically about family planning. You can even access some youth [information] that we have been able to release. You can have an interface with experts.

LL Annet Kyarimpa Mukabe.

AKM There are quite a number of non-government organisations that are providing youth friendly services. But this is limited in terms of numbers, geographical coverage and the reach for young people. So I think it’s important for governments to have youth friendly services in the public health facilities. That will address the stigma, but it will create space for young people. Space in terms of physical infrastructure, having trained staff in providing youth friendly services. But also at community level to be able to address the cultural and traditional barriers that stop young girls from demanding and using family and sexual reproductive services.

LL As stakeholders prepare to meet at the 2017 summit this summer, Beth Schlachter believes that now more than ever the global community must pull together.

BS So I think the summit comes at a perfect time because it allows us to plan together how we’re going to work together smarter and more effectively going forward, recognising that this a period of transition and uncertainty. So it’s a really positive moment for pulling the community together to say we’ve been working on family planning for 50 years; we’ve weathered different kinds of transitions before. We’re a strong sector, we know the work that we need to do, now let’s just get on with it. And let’s make sure we’re working the partnership in a way that keeps everybody together and making those decisions that are going to allow us to advance.

The singer says he felt ‘terrorised’ by the armed officer who he says detained him for half an hour and screamed in his face

The singer Morrissey said on Wednesday that he had been “terrorised” by a police officer in Rome who held him at gunpoint for half an hour on a busy street.



The former lead singer of the Smiths, a long-time fan of Rome who had returned to the Italian capital to record an album, said the officer unlocked his gun and “screamed into my face” as a crowd of more than 100 people watched.

Morrissey’s nephew Sam Esty Rayner, a photographer who often takes footage of the singer, posted a picture of the officer and wrote his motorbike’s licence plate number on Facebook.

“The Police Officer pictured below terrorized Morrissey for 35 minutes demanding ‘papers’. Morrissey had no papers,” Rayner wrote.

Morrissey in a statement accused the officer of a “deliberate act of terror” and said he had not broken any law. “I believe he recognised me and wanted to frighten me. I did not back down even though I believed he was about to shoot me,” Morrissey said.

“I urge people to beware of this dangerously aggressive officer. He might kill you,” he said.

Morrissey has frequently criticised the police both in his music and off-stage. In 2015, he said he was “sexually assaulted” by an officer at San Francisco International Airport who touched him during a security check.

The gang were jailed in April at Liverpool crown court after raiding cash machines across the country PA:Press Association Archive

The legal aid cost of defending the gang that blew up more than a dozen ATMs, including three in Scotland, topped £1 million.

Seven men were jailed for a total of 92 years for a series of raids that netted them £550,000 and caused an estimated £160,000 of damage.

The gang were jailed in April at Liverpool crown court after raiding cash machines in Merseyside, Cheshire, Berkshire, Gloucestershire and Suffolk in England, and Aberdeen, Perth and Carnoustie in 2015 and 2016.

The total cost of their defence came to £1,020,173.05, according to a breakdown of costs provided by the ministry of justice.

Anthony White, 26, the ring leader, of Huyton, Merseyside, ran up the largest single legal bill — £129,088 for his solicitor, £98,675 for his…

State schools students are performing better in their science A-levels than pupils at one of the country’s most expensive boarding schools.

According to a new league table measuring schools on their science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) expertise, boys from a number of free schools and grammars are more likely to do well than their peers at Eton College.

Reading School, King Edward VI Camp Hill School for Boys, and Sutton Grammar in Surrey have all been awarded top places in the Your Life league table, a government-backed campaign to promote science skills in school leavers.

A number of new specialist free schools – state schools run independently of local authority – are also proving to be performing well when partnered with universities.

King’s College London Mathematics School, which opened in 2014, comes top of the new table despite only making 24th place in traditional A-level rankings.

A similar free school sponsored by Exeter University comes fourth compared with a general A-level ranking of 168.

Pupils from Sir Isaac Newton Sixth Form Free School in Norwich and Sidney Stringer Academy in Coventry also received top teaching for sciences.

The most expensive schools in the world







10 show all The most expensive schools in the world

















1/10 La Rosey, Switzerland This prestigious Swiss boarding school is believed to be the most expensive in the world. Le Rosey hosts pupils from seven to 18 and has been co-educational since 1967. The school takes in pupils from more than 60 countries, but allows no more than 10 per cent of its students to come from any one country in order to prevent a single nationality dominating. The school has two campuses – winter is spent in Gstaad, where pupils can make use of the ski slopes after their morning lessons. Come spring, the whole school will uproot to the Chataeau du Rosey in the village of Rolle by Lake Geneva. Le Rosey also boats a 1,000 seat concert hall, equestrian centre and 38-foot yacht. Notable alumni: Shah of Iran, Prince Rainier of Monaco and King Farouk of Egypt. Sir Roger Moore and Elizabeth Taylor also send their children here, along with John Lennon’s son Sean and Winston Churchill’s grandson. Fees: approx. £86,657 pa

2/10 Aiglon College, Switzerland With a view of Mont Blanc, this high altitude school lends itself to outdoor pursuits. The school caters for boys and girls aged nine to 18 and is modelled on the traditional British Boarding school. Unlike most schools, however, the whole school body comes together for 20 minutes of meditation on three mornings each week. Notable alumni: Actor Michel Gill, Princess Tatiana of Greece and Denmark, Sheherazade Goldsmith Fees: up to £80,810 per year (upper school boarding)

Notable alumni: kept suspiciously on the down-low Fees: £52,010 - £59,680 pa Brillantmont, Switzerland

10/10 Hurtwood house, Surrey Hurtwood house, surrey Several of the best UK boarding schools top their fees around this mark. Set in an Edwardian mansion with 200 acres of grounds, Hurtwood House is one of the most unique. The school hosts just 340 pupils and is known for its focus on creativity and the arts – a recent school production of Chicago cost £75,000 to stage, according to Tatler. Notable alumni: Emily Blunt, Jack Huston, Hans Zimmer Fees: £39,555 pa

Eton College, which charges fees of more than £32,000 per year, appeared less favourably, however.

The elite boys’ boarding school – whose famous alumni include politicians and royals – was ranked 109th for STEM skills.

Lady Eleanor Holles, a girls’ independent school in southwest London, fell from 19th place nationally to 160th in the new tables.

Edwina Dunn, chairwoman of Your Life and chief executive of Starcount, which compiled the data, said the general league tables rewarded schools for grades rather than subjects, but modern rankings needed to measure how desirable pupils are for businesses and jobs.

(Your Life)

“The challenge of Brexit is upon us and the clock is ticking if we want to have the workforce we need to compete in the world," she said.

"School performance measurements should more closely reflect the skill requirements of the UK economy and reward subject expertise in the most demand skills areas."

The group has called for a "rethink" of how schools are assessed to give greater weight to the subjects that open up the most career prospects.

“There are schools up and down the country that are doing a great job in preparing their pupils for the job market today and in the future.”

Education Secretary Justine Greening avoids question of which expert backs more grammar schools

In 2011, around one fifth of the UK workforce was employed in science-based roles, equating to 5.8 million people.

This number is expected to rise to 7.1 million by the year 2030, placing increasing pressure on the younger generation to leave school equipped with STEM skills.

Launching an All Party Parliamentary Group enquiry earlier this year into how well schools prepare pupils for careers, cross-party MPs urged for the STEM skills gap to be addressed in light of the current global climate.

“Technological and business advances are made at an accelerated rate [and] young people must be provided with the ability to upskill and retrain to move fluidly between career sectors,” said the group’s chair, MP Danny Kinahan.

“If we fail to adequately prepare new generations for this shift, we risk stifling the entrepreneurial spirit and ambition that makes Britain internationally competitive and culturally vibrant.”

Responding to the new rankings, Heather Hanbury, Lady Eleanor Holles school headteacher, said the number of her pupils taking STEM subjects and achieving top grades was growing every year.

She told The Times: “In a school where well over 60 per cent of sixth formers take Stem subjects and where we are investing heavily in computing, robotics and technology, we believe the future for Stem at LEH is fantastic."

Eton College has been contacted for a response.

Michael Gove says that if people who get degrees go on to earn well, they should pay something back (Report, 3 July). My daughter is almost 30, in her first postdoctoral job, earning real money at last. When she went to university she took out loans for fees only – we paid her rent, and she worked evenings and weekends to live. She then was on a scholarship through her master’s and PhD. She had a year out through illness, when she could claim nothing and lived on her credit card and overdraft. Finally she is a woman in science doing research into Zika and other viruses. She is earning enough to start paying back her loan and is happy to do so. But her monthly repayment only scrapes the surface of the capital debt. It is mostly paying the interest accrued over all those years of intense study. And that is a disgrace.

Janet Moore

Harleston, Norfolk

• Graduates already do pay back. First, by paying back their loans with interest. Second, by paying taxes, at higher rates if they earn well. Third, and most importantly, by their enormous contributions to the wellbeing of all in this country through their cultural, intellectual, financial and scientific skills and by their outstanding achievements in such professions as law, teaching, healthcare etc. Educating our young people in HEIs is an investment that pays off more obviously and significantly than the machinations of our ruling political classes.

Trump again demands more NATO spending, mulls 'severe things' on North Korea

WARSAW U.S. President Donald Trump once more urged NATO allies in Europe on Thursday to spend more on defence, on a visit to Poland that had been billed as an opportunity for him to patch up relations after a tense alliance summit in May.

Lewis Hamilton dominated the Chinese Grand Prix to reassert a measure of Mercedes supremacy over Ferrari, but although the record books will show he achieved the triple of pole position, fastest lap and victory, he was under pressure from Sebastian Vettel's Ferrari throughout the race.

"Hamilton won... but Vettel had the measure of him in pace – as he had when beating him at the first round in Melbourne – but was unlucky with pit stops behind the safety car and was held up when stuck behind his team-mate Kimi Raikkonen," says Giles Richards of The Guardian.

The pair traded fastest laps as they led from the front, and there appeared to be very little between the cars. "Ferrari's pace is quickly turning F1 2017 into a classic and the small print of their performance in Shanghai, a circuit where Mercedes traditionally excel, will have the world champions worried heading to Bahrain," says Sky Sports.

Over the final laps, when the two drivers were able to push their cars to the maximum, the statistics are striking. "Hamilton's outright pace was a smidgen better than Vettel's: a 1:35.378 compared to a 1:35.423. But it was Vettel who had the more consistent pace: while the Ferrari was in the 1:35s 14 times over the last 17 laps, Hamilton could only better 1:36 on ten occasions."

It seems that the German team have a true challenger this season.

"Mercedes find themselves locked in a battle with a Ferrari team whose car appears to be at least as fast, and Hamilton faces a fight with a rival who he truly respects as being close to an equal," says Andrew Benson of the BBC.

The scenario has been a long time coming for F1. "Probably 2010 was the most recent equivalent to what F1 has in 2017 – when Vettel and Red Bull team-mate Mark Webber, Alonso in a Ferrari, and Hamilton and Jenson Button in McLarens fought a five-way battle for much of the season," says Benson. "Before then, the breathless McLaren v Ferrari battles of 2007 and 2008 were the closest to what appears to be developing."

But could 2017 turn out to be a three horse race? Teenager Max Verstappen was the third driver on the podium after another sensational drive in his Red Bull.

Having started in 16th place, the Dutchman made up an incredible nine places on the first lap in wet conditions. He "has demonstrated his raw talent before, not least in Brazil last season, but his confidence and audacity and the excitement he generates when behind the wheel are quite inspiring and just what the sport needs", says the Guardian.

However, he will do well to keep pace with the two main contenders. "The 19-year-old's chance will surely come," says Phil Duncan of the Daily Telegraph. "[But] it looks as though it will have to wait for at least another year, for this season's championship is now almost certainly a straight shoot-out between Hamilton and Vettel."

Tesla Inc's Model S did not get the top score in certain tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), the agency said on Thursday.

Chevrolet Impala, Ford Motor Co's Taurus and Tesla's Model S were the three sedans that got "only an acceptable rating" in a test designed to simulate what happens when the front driver-side corner of a vehicle strikes a tree or another vehicle, the IIHS said.

Ford's Lincoln Continental, the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Toyota Motor Corp's Avalon received the highest rating overall, the agency said.

In the test, the seat belt in Tesla's Model S was not effective and could lead to the driver's head striking the steering wheel hard through the air bag, according to the report.

Tesla's Model S received the highest rating in IIHS's crash testing in every category except one, the small overlap front crash test, where it received the second highest rating available, a Tesla spokesperson said in an email.

"IIHS and dozens of other private industry groups around the world have methods and motivations that suit their own subjective purposes," the spokesperson said.

Tesla said the most objective and accurate independent vehicle safety test is done by the U.S. government, which found Model S and Model X to have the lowest probability of injury of any cars that it has ever tested.

In order to get the top IIHS rating, automakers must have a frontal crash prevention system with automatic braking capabilities to prevent a rear-end collision.

The vehicles must stop or slow down without driver intervention before hitting a target in tests at 12 or 25 miles per hour among other factors, IIHS said.

Toyota said in a statement it is committed to developing safe and reliable vehicles.

General Motors Co declined to comment, while Ford and Mercedes were not immediately available for comment.

The IIHS is a research arm of the insurance industry, and its crash tests are increasingly influential in guiding vehicle safety design. Automakers strive for top ratings in IIHS tests as they do on federal crash tests.

A third of home buyers moving to their second home expect to go cap in hand to those around them to borrow more than £21,200, despite half of those having already received financial support for their first property worth an average of just over £21,500.

Despite easing lending conditions, research from Lloyds Bank suggests rising property prices mean thousands of so-called second steppers say they wouldn’t be able to make their next move up the home-owning ladder without financial support from family and friends.

As well as using equity from their current property and plundering their savings, one in five second steppers one in five will go to parents, almost one in ten will ask grandparents for money to fund their property and more than one in 20 would even ask friends for help.

The price difference between a typical first-time-buyer home and a second stepper’s ideal home – typically a detached property – is £126,000. However, the average equity level of £105,068 from the sale of their first home can help to reduce this gap by 83 per cent, meaning that second steppers need only add an extra £21,005 to their existing mortgage.

Without that help, more than a third of second steppers say they wouldn’t be able to make their next move. However, of those who require financial help from their parents, almost half believe that their parents have had to make sacrifices in order to help them move up the property ladder.

But movers are also planning to make sacrifices to sell their first home and achieve their second property aims, including having children later in life, having fewer children than they had originally planned and even changing their career.

“Parental support continues to play a vital role in helping young people to get on the property ladder. It is clear that despite improved conditions for this part of the housing market, second steppers will still rely on the “Bank of Mum and Dad”, with hard-pressed parents being once again called on for financial help,” says Andy Mason, mortgage director at Lloyds Bank.

“However, it is encouraging to see many second steppers planning ahead by overpaying their mortgage and making bigger contributions into savings accounts to prepare for when the perfect home becomes available.”

Despite that, a quarter of second steppers report the second jump is harder than getting on the bottom rung, due to a lack of affordable, family-sized properties on the market, the cost of stamp duty and potential changes to interest rates.

They are right to be concerned.

The base interest rate – set by the Bank of England, and used by mortgage providers as a key component in calculating the cost of home loans – has been at a “once in a generation” low for eight years.

In that time the average UK property price has risen by more than 40 per cent, the equivalent of £60,000. In hotspots like Cambridge, prices have doubled in that time and in the capital, the average property has broken through the £500,000 barrier, figures from online estate agent HouseSimple.com suggest.

Galloping prices have pushed buyers to the very edges of their finances and beyond, but with the benefit of historically low monthly costs as base rates dropped to 0.5 per cent in 2009 and then to 0.25 per cent last summer.

That may all be about to change however, as the records from the latest Monetary Policy Committee meeting, the group that decides the base rate each month shows growing numbers of members are now in favour of increasing the rate as a result of the most up-to-date economic data.

It could mean an interest rate rise for the first time in around 100 months, something many would-be second steppers have never known, such is the length of time the base rate has been so low.

At the same time, property prices appear to be moving away from the fundamental drivers that push them up with alarming speed.

The Lendy Property Pulse index, which tracks property prices against key factors affecting them, such as average weekly earnings, employment levels, mortgage lending, interest rates and how many new properties are being built, has gone up by 17 per cent in the last two years while property prices have typically increased by 20 per cent.

All this points to what we already knew, that property prices are out of reach for most would-be buyers and movers. For those who have stretched themselves more than is comfortable, with large loans from both formal and informal sources, that chicken is in all likelihood about to come home to roost.

And with the latest data suggesting prices are now beginning to fall, fears over negative equity – another phenomenon that many first- and second-time buyers will have no experience of – are also beginning to increase.

In that case, second steppers may find scraping together the deposit for their next big move with help from their parents is the least of their problems.

In 1942 the US War Department wrote a handbook for American soldiers in Britain, a sort of beginner’s guide to Britain (or, as it would inevitably have been called in this nostalgia-fest show, Blighty). It advised them of the peculiarities of the British and would have been essential reading for soldiers who would never have been outside their small town, much less the country.

We know about this small book only because a curator in the Bodleian Library rediscovered it in 2005 and it was then republished. The director, John Walton, stumbled across it, a memento Anglia circa 1942, in a bookshop and thought it was such an “endearing snapshot” of England that it deserved to be made into a show, roping in the Fringe-tastic…

The latest instalment of the simian movie saga War for the Planet of the Apes is due out in a couple of weeks' time and critics are already predicting it will be one of the biggest – and darkest – blockbuster hits of the summer.

The sequel to 2014's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and the third instalment in the Planet of the Apes reboot movie series, War sees Andy Serkis's chimp leader Caesar forced into a deadly conflict against the humans, led by Woody Harrelson's brutal Colonel.

After the apes suffer terrible losses, Caesar confronts the Colonel, with each determined to take control of the destiny of their species and the future of the planet.

Critics have hailed Serkis's memorable performance as Caesar and say the movie is a triumph of storytelling and spectacle.

Todd McCarthy in the Hollywood Reporter says that thanks to War, the Apes film trilogy "clicks from beginning to end". Its success, says the critic, is rooted in Andy Serkis's "indelible performance as a reluctant rebel leader", along with splendid special effects and "a shrewd racial/political thematic thread".

The "sheer beauty of the film is intense", adds McCarthy. He praises the cinematography for "intoxicatingly" capturing the world around the apes and says the story "dares to be morally complex instead of reductive for blockbuster audiences".

Pete Hammond on Deadline Hollywood urges even those who are not fans of the genre to go.

"This is a film that stands on its own and will blow you away," says Hammond, who calls War "a dazzling, thrilling and mind-reeling experience from start to finish".

Terry Clune’s Succeed in Ireland is in a dispute with the IDA over the relative success of a job creation scheme LAURA HUTTON/PHOTOCALL IRELAND

The IDA has paid out almost €3.5 million in fees to ConnectIreland, the contractor it is embroiled in a longstanding dispute with, according to its chief executive.

ConnectIreland, founded by entrepreneur Terry Clune in 2012, and the state development agency are in conflict over the administration of the Succeed in Ireland job creation scheme.

Under the scheme, which was set up at the height of the recession, members of the public — and of the diaspora in particular — were encouraged to introduce potential foreign investors to Ireland in exchange for a cash reward.

The dispute is over the number of jobs created by the scheme. ConnectIreland claimed 1,046 jobs had been created with a further 1,300 in the pipeline. IDA Ireland has verified only…

The Italian electorate has rejected a major constitutional reform in a national referendum, precipitating the resignation of the Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.

Many eyes have turned to the weak Italian banking sector for market reaction.

The share price of Italy’s third largest bank Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS) fell sharply when the stock market opened.

The other major listed Italian banks – Unicredit, UBI, Banco Popolare, Mediobanca and Intesa Sanpaolo – are also now trading considerably lower.

Going down

Reuters Eikon

Is Italy facing a new financial crisis? Are traders now assuming Italy will leave the single currency?

We answer the big questions below.

What is wrong with Italy’s banks?

The fundamental problem is that the sector was never properly restructured and recapitalised in the wake of the global financial meltdown and the subsequent eurozone crisis.

The result is that these banks are now weighed down by a heap of “non-performing loans” with a nominal value of around €360bn – around 16 per cent of the total of all their assets.

Low interest rates from the European Central Bank and the extreme weakness of the Italian economy in recent years have also damaged the banks’ profitability.

They upshot is that they urgently need to be recapitalised – either with private or public funds. Monte dei Paschi had planned to begin a €5bn capital raising process this week.

The size of the total capital hole in the Italian banking sector is estimated by Citi at between €20bn and €40bn, or between 1.2 and 2.4 per cent of Italian GDP.

Why does the Italian referendum result matter to any of this?

Because the government is a central actor in the bank recapitalisation drama.

The Renzi government had been walking a political and economic tightrope in recent years. It needs to help recapitalise the banks for the good of the wider economy, but eurozone rules mean all banks can only be bailed out with public money if private bondholders are first “bailed in”, meaning these debt investors have to take losses.

This is to ensure private lenders to banks do not get a backdoor public bailout when banks fail, as happened in many Western countries in 2008/09, prompting great public anger.

The problem in Italy is that several banks flogged around €30bn of their subordinated bonds to ordinary Italian households, rather than just sophisticated institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance companies. Subordinated, or junior, bonds are first in line for losses in the event of a bail-in.

And according to the IMF retail investors also hold a third of the total €600bn of bank bonds.

These vulnerable households – though relatively small in number – stand to take disastrous and politically-explosive losses in the event of a bondholder bail-in.

The government has been working to avoid this outcome, while also putting the banks on a stronger financial footing.

The Renzi strategy has been to encourage the banks to raise new funds privately first, but if this fails, to prepare to undertake a bail-in recapitalisation with special protection for small investors.

On top of this, the Renzi government has been the sponsor of a scheme to package up and sell off the questionable debt on Italian banks’ balance sheets at a major discount to other private investors.

So the government can’t help now?

The fall of the Renzi government means this whole delicate bank support strategy is now up in the air.

Without a political backstop some analysts think stricken banks like Monte Dei Paschi could struggle to raise new private capital.

“The No result in the referendum has undoubtedly made it harder to attract private sector capital to fill Monte dei Paschi’s gaping capital hole,” said Kathleen Brooks of City Index.

“The risk is that investors lose faith that it will be able to do this, which triggers a run on the bank and a full-blown financial crisis.”

So why have the share prices not totally collapsed?

Largely because the referendum result and the fall of the Renzi government was “priced in” by the financial markets already.

Opinion polls two weeks ago had pointed to the likely rejection of the reforms.

And the share prices of Italian banks had already been falling sharply.

The sector as a whole has lost nearly half its stock market capitalisation this year.

Already punished

Reuters Eikon

So what will happen now?

Many analysts predict a caretaker government will be appointed by the Italian President and that this government will still be led by Renzi’s Democratic Party, possibly by the current finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan.

This administration could carry on with the previous bank recapitalisation strategy – although there can be no certainty about this.

Economists at Citi point out that Italian banks hold €400bn of Italian government bonds.

They warn that if traders mark down the value of these bonds in the coming weeks due to renewed political and economic uncertainty, it could prompt further falls in Italian banks' stock prices, creating a "vicious spiral" of lower bank lending and weaker GDP growth.

“Italy's financial markets, its underfunded banks and its overall economy could suffer unless Italy resolves its political crisis fast,” said Holger Schmieding of Berenberg.

What if the new government falls?

The most dangerous scenario for Italian bank investors is if there are early elections and the populist Five Star movement manages to form a government.

Five Star, which is currently the second most popular party and which campaigned strongly for the "no" vote in the referendum, wants to hold a referendum on Italy’s membership of the eurozone.

There are big instutitional obstacles to any of this happening – but if Italy voted to leave the single currency the ramifications would not only be disastrous for Italian banks but the entire eurozone.

“Fried pizza is Woman,” Isabella De Cham tells me boldly as she drops a half-moon pizza pocket into a bubbling fryer and I watch it rapidly double in size. “It’s always been made by women, that’s why we say ‘pizza fritta è donna’.” I’ve come to visit her at 1947 Pizza Fritta, a small eatery located near the city’s train station, to learn more about this cultural and culinary phenomenon – not fried pizza, but female pizza makers.

Enter any pizzeria in the historic centre of Naples and you’re sure to observe a crew of men kneading, stretching, tossing and baking superlative pies for throngs of hungry customers. Pizza in Naples is not only a source of epicurean pleasure and national pride; it is regarded as a veritable art form, one that is vying to be included in Unesco’s “Intangible Heritage” List (results to be announced in early 2018).

With hundreds of establishments striving to be recognised as the best in the city, it’s hard to stand out from the crowd, but one thing is certain about the competition: it’s dominated by men. But after watching Sophia Loren fry up pizzas in Vittorio De Sica’s L’Oro di Napoli, I knew this wasn’t just a man’s trade and, thus inspired, had set off in search of her modern heirs.

Isabella de Cham has been awarded the title of Pizza Champion ( Livia Hengel )

At 24, Isabella is already considered one of the best pizza makers in Naples and has been compared to Sophia Loren’s character for her superlative creations. Her favourite variant, which features smoked provolone cheese from Sorrento, cacciocavallo, rucola and lemon zest, even landed her the title of Pizza Champion at the Campionato Nazionale Pizza DOC in Nocera last year.

“Traditionally pizza margherita was considered a luxury because mozzarella was costly. And standing in front of an oven was an arduous task – so it was the man’s job. Fried pizza instead used common ingredients, ricotta and fatty pork bits, and was smaller in size so it was easier for feminine hands to fold,” she explains as she opens her palms. They are indeed nimble: perfect for kneading and folding the small pies.

And Isabella isn’t the only woman causing a stir. In an era of celebrity chefs, there are naturally plenty of celebrity pizzaioli, but one is particularly conspicuous. Blonde, bubbly and often outfitted in a flowing peasant blouse, Teresa Iorio isn’t your traditional Neapolitan pizza maker. She is the first woman to win the Trofeo Caputo Pizza Championship, earning her the title of Worldwide Champion Pizzaiola – an achievement that is proudly documented in photos hanging on the walls of her pizzeria, Le Figlie di Iorio.

“My father was a pizzaiolo and my mother made fried pizzas on the weekends,” Teresa, who opened her restaurant in 2006, tells me. “My love for pizza came from my father. You see, I am the 19th of 20 children and I started making pizza when I was 12 to help out the family and lessen his load.”

She is proud of her heritage and credits her success to the secret recipe she’s inherited. “It was an enormous satisfaction to win the Trofeo Caputo Championship in 2015 and be recognised for my pizza, a tradition I’ve carried over from my father,” she says. Now Teresa wants to share that tradition, with ambitions to give back to the local community by creating employment opportunities for women.

“I want to dedicate my work to others, it’s my biggest desire,” she says, sliding a pizza into the burning wood-fire oven. She is collaborating with the highly successful Neapolitan Rossopomodoro restaurant chain to make fried pizzas at their waterfront location and hopes to expand her brand, “femmena e fritta” (female and fried), in order to train and hire women in her image.

Pizza making is a woman’s work at Le Figlie di Iorio (Livia Hengel)



“I’m a feminist,” she says. “I love women, and too many are disadvantaged and in need. My hope and dream is to teach women my trade and give them the opportunity to work.” In her own establishment, Teresa practises what she preaches – she employs two of her sisters and a niece.

Another up and coming pizzaiola, Maria Cacialli, also began her career young – very young. “I began [my training] in my mother’s womb,” she says. “My mother and my father met in a pizzeria and I was practically born on bags of flour. Making pizza was always my dream and it will remain so for all of my life. I have it in my DNA.”

Her pizzeria, La Figlia del Presidente (The Daughter of the President), is an homage to her father Ernesto Cacialli, who famously handed a pizza to former US President Bill Clinton in 1994 and promptly became immortalised as “The President’s Pizzaiolo”.

Maria Cacialli is the only woman in a team of 20 pizza makers ( Livia Hengel )

I ask Maria if she finds it difficult to be a woman in a world dominated by men, and she chuckles knowingly. “The difficulties are every day,” she says. “I work alongside 20 men, including my husband and son; it’s not easy for a woman to make space for herself and command attention. But I am very tenacious and strong, I’m always able to overcome the odds.”

Why doesn’t she hire other women to work alongside her? “Women have a mind of their own,” she laughs, “I prefer working with men… they’re easier to control.”

Christmas is a time for giving, a time for receiving and - in various parts of the world - a time for tossing shoes, roller-skating to church and feasting on KFC.

Here are the strangest Christmas traditions from around the world:

Finland: A festive sauna

The peak of Finnish Christmas celebrations comes on Christmas Eve, when Finns head to the sauna to strip off and relax before the evening festivities. But they have to be quick: according to folklore, the spirits of dead ancestors bathe in the sauna after the early Nordic sunset.

India: Christmas banana trees

Given the lack of pine trees in India, it is traditional for families to decorate a banana or mango tree in much the same way. The 25 million Christians in India often decorate their houses with Mango leaves and place oil-burning lamps on their roof-tops, symbolising the light of Jesus.

Czech Republic: Shoe tossing for a husband

A Christmas Eve custom invites single Czech women to stand with their backs to the front door and remove a shoe. They hurl it over their shoulder towards the door, and how it lands will predict their romantic prospects for the year. If the toe of the shoe faces the door, the thrower is destined to marry. If it's the heel, it's another painful 12-month wait.

Ukraine: Web-savvy Christmas

The traditional Ukrainian Christmas tree is draped not with tinsel and baubles, but with spiders webs - or in most cases, an artificial substitute. The tradition grew up around the legend of a family so poor that their tree would have gone bare, had it not been for a spider spinning a beautiful web over it in time for Christmas morning.

Japan: Kentucky Fried Christmas

Over the past few years, it has become customary for the Japanese to tuck into a festive feast of KFC on Christmas Day. Thanks to a successful advertising campaign, KFC branches throughout Japan report that families will queue around the block to pick up their battered thighs and wings. It has now become so popular that orders for the KFC Christmas Party Barrel are taken as early as October.

Venezuela: Christmas roller-skating

Every year between 16 and 24 December in Caracas, Venezuela, roads are closed to traffic to let people roller-skate to the early morning Christmas mass. On their way, skaters will tug on the ends of long pieces of string tied by children to their big toes and dangled out of the window.

Netherlands: Black Peter

Every November in the Netherlands, Father Christmas - or Sinterklaas, as he's know to the Dutch - arrives from Spain by steamship, bringing with him an escort of Zwarte Pieten (Black Peters), all with blackened faces, red lips and curly hair. The role of the Black Peters is to assist Santa and perform impressive acrobatic feats to amaze the children who turn out to see them every year. The tradition has led to controversy, with the UN condemning it as “a throwback to slavery”, although its supporters insist that it's a harmless Christmas tradition.

Norway: Edible logs

In Norway, families will burn a 'Yule log' in a tradition that dates back to the ancient Norse celebration of the return of the sun at winter solstice. The Norse believed that the Earth was heated by a huge wheel of fire (the Sun), which rolled closer or further away as the year progressed. Norwegians are also partial to edible Yule logs - a traditional dessert made of rolled-up sponge cake that resembles a tree trunk.

Mexico: Processions and piñatas

In Mexico, from 16 December to Christmas Eve, children often perform the 'posadas' – a series of nine processions to re-enact the part of the Christmas story where Joseph and Mary go in search of somewhere to stay. On the final night of the posadas, a Church service is held featuring food, games and fireworks. One game that recurs is the smashing of a piñata – a decorated clay or papier-mâché container filled with sweets and hung from the ceiling or tree branch. To play the game, children are blind-folded and take turns hitting the piñata with a stick until it breaks open pouring its contents (usually sweets or other treats) onto the floor.

Spain: Caga Tio the Catalan poop log

Caga Tio is a hollowed-out log with a happy face and legs, which must be fed with goodies such as sweets, candies and nuts in the run-up to Christmas. On Christmas Eve, families put him by the fire and beat him softly with a stick until he's pooped out all the goodies. The last thing to come out is normally a garlic bulb, onion or maybe even a salt herring. During the beating, families often sing a song like this to encourage the log: "Poop log, poop nougats, hazelnuts and cottage cheese, if you don't poop well, I'll hit you with a stick, poop log!"

Belarus: Rooster rules

Christmas is a time for singletons to have their fortunes told by a rooster in the former Soviet state of Belarus.

Traditionally, every festive season, the single women of a town have grains of corn laid out in front of them and a rooster from a nearby farm is placed among them. Whoever's corn is eaten first will be the next one to get married.

In another strange tradition aimed at keeping spinsters occupied, married women in Belarus lord it over their unattached friends by hiding items around their house for them to hunt, imploring the singletons to search high and low. If they find bread, they're destined to marry a rich man, a ring means they're in line to marry a handsome man - assuming the married women haven't snapped up all the wealthiest and attractive men in town.

HAMBURG "Welcome to Hell". That's the greeting for U.S. President Donald Trump and other world leaders from anti-capitalist protesters in Hamburg, who have vowed to disrupt the G20 summit in the German port city.

Among the 100,000 protesters expected in the city, some 8,000 are deemed by security forces to be ready to commit violence, posing a challenge for those tasked with securing the July 7-8 summit of leaders of the world's 20 biggest economies.

There has been no significant violence at several smaller demonstrations in the city this week, including a march on Wednesday by more than 7,000 beer-drinking mainly young revellers holding placards denouncing capitalism and G20 leaders.

But a fire overnight at a Porsche car dealer in the north of the city that damaged eight vehicles could be a foretaste of what's to come. Police said they were investigating whether it was an arson attack.

"There is no concrete evidence to link the incident to the G20 summit," a police spokesman told Reuters. "But we assume this is the case."

Locals are unhappy with Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to hold the summit in the centre of Germany's second-largest city as they fear property damage by violent protesters. Their daily routines are also being disrupted by security measures.

Up to 20,000 police officers will be on duty to watch over the main demonstration, dubbed "Welcome to Hell" by the alliance of anti-capitalist groups who organised it. Protesters have said they will try to block roads in the city.

Merkel took a big gamble in deciding to host the summit, where leaders will hold talks on difficult issues from trade and climate change to African development, in the city of her birth.

Should the protests go awry, her reputation could be damaged less than three months before an election in which she is seeking a fourth term.

To air the locals' disenchantment, Hamburg-based soft drinks maker Fritz Kola has launched a poster advertising campaign featuring a portrait of Trump snoozing. A caption reads: "Wake up, man! Fritz Kola. Lots of caffeine".

Protesters say the G20 has failed to solve many of the issues threatening world peace, including climate change, rising inequality and violent conflicts.

'EGOISTIC LEADER'

Tens of thousands will gather at the fish market in the borough of St Pauli - known for its red light district - at 1400 GMT, around the same time as Air Force One is due to land in Hamburg. They will then march north to the heavily secured summit venue.

"It's ridiculous that police say some of us are violent when starting tomorrow the leaders of the world's largest weapon exporting and importing nations will be arriving in our city," said Stefan Hubert, a 32-year-old graphic designer who came to the protest on Wednesday with three friends.

Holding a placard reading 'Make love great again!' he added: "This summit is a waste of money that could be better spent on deploying more boats to stop migrants fleeing war and hunger from drowning in the Mediterranean."

Turkish-German protester Fatima Cicek said she and her two sisters came to the demonstration on Wednesday to make the point that the G20 is undemocratic as it is a forum where a handful of leaders make decisions that could impact the whole world.

But her main issue is with Trump.

"He is the most disruptive and egotistic leader at the summit," the veiled 38-year-old social worker said.

There is an irony in the protesters' dislike of Trump. The U.S. president and anti-capitalist activists have something in common: distrust of globalisation.

Yet Trump is in Hamburg to push for trade rules that benefit America, including steel makers facing tough competition from China, while the protesters are here to demand more rights for the poor regardless of where they live.

"Trump is here to promote his own interests and those of the richest people in America," said Cicek. "We are demanding more rights for the millions of people in Africa who have no roof over their heads."

If you work in the public sector, we’d like you to share your thoughts and experiences of the decade-long cap on pay increases

Ministers are calling on the public sector pay cap to be reconsidered, after a new report found median hourly earnings of UK workers dropped in real terms by almost 6% between 2005 and 2015, with some sectors suffering worse drops than others.



Labour said the figures were highly significant, damning evidence of “the harsh and unfair reality of the Tories’ pay freeze on hard-working public sector workers”, whose earnings are decided by the government in contrast to those in the private sector.

Pay rises for five million public sector workers are set by independent pay review bodies, but have been capped at 1% since 2013, before which there was a two-year freeze on pay for all but the lowest-paid workers.

The teaching profession has seen average pay fall by £3 an hour in real terms and police officers by £2 an hour, while the wages of nurses have stagnated during a decade of public sector salary freezes. Police officers saw a median real earnings fall from £20 an hour to £18 an hour, and prison officers saw median real earnings fall from £16 an hour to £15 an hour over the same period.

The issue of public sector pay is expected to come to a head at a meeting of the cabinet on Tuesday morning, after signals from a series of influential ministers, including Boris Johnson, Jeremy Hunt, Justine Greening and Michael Gove.

Uber is pulling its primary service out of Finland as it waits for a law that will deregulate the taxi market to be passed.

The cab firm, which exclusively operates in the nation’s capital Helsinki, is suspending its UberPop service, which allows any driver to sign up and offer unlicensed taxi trips.

“We want to ensure that we do not pose drivers who use our app or our employees any unnecessary issues, especially now that we have a bright future to look forward to. We believe that the best way to do so and focus on the future is to pause UberPop and relaunch in the summer of 2018,” said Joel Järvinen, Uber’s country manager for Finland, in a blog post on Thursday.

“While we are looking forward to the reforms coming into effect, we have decided it is best to pause UberPop from 15 August until the new regulations allow a better environment,” Järvinen added.

Uber’s luxury licensed service, UberBlack, will continue operating in the Finnish capital Helsinki, and Jarvinen said the company is committed to supporting the hundreds of drivers who would no longer be able to make money with UberPop.

Uber is legal in Finland provided its drivers hold valid taxi licences, but the company has been the target of police investigations and drivers have been ordered to give up their earnings to the state for not having valid taxi permits.

Once the new law comes into effect, drivers will still need permits but annual permit quotas and fare restrictions will be removed, which could help new entrants to the market.

Helsinki district court last week ordered Jarvinen’s assets to be confiscated until police conclude an investigation into whether Uber operates an illegal taxi service in Finland.

UberPop is at the heart of many of the company’s legal troubles around the world, since it is the main service that allows unlicensed and unregulated drivers to operate on the platform. It has already been forced out of multiple European cities, including Paris, Brussels and Berlin, and for those locales where demand isn’t high enough to support a licensed option, it has resulted in the company abandoning the place entirely: Frankfurt, Hamburg and Düsseldorf lost their Uber service in 2015, as a result of a German ban on UberPop.

In the UK, where unlicensed taxi operations are strictly against the law and carry a £1,000 fine for drivers caught offering illegal services, UberPOP has never been offered, and Uber drivers must carry a minicab licence – although the company has faced criticism for allowing drivers to work in cities other than the one they hold a licence for.

If you’re really serious about competitive running, there are companies that test your DNA to determine your sporting potential. But does it work?

Growing up, I was always the dumpy, unsporty one. Matt, my older brother, was the skinny one who did the running, jumping and anything requiring quickness and coordination. He seemed to excel with ease while I laboured away on a sluggish course towards sub-mediocrity. This pattern lasted until our late teens when Matt, being older, beat me to booze. While he was away on a year-long, round-the-world bender, I took up running — with a vengeance. It was time to turn the tables.



By the time Matt got back, I’d joined the local running club and was training every day. It turned out that becoming a competent runner didn’t require special talent, just lots of miles – driven on by the sense I was outrunning my former, slouchy self. Matt, visibly shaken by my transformation, threw himself into training to catch up – stymied by his three-kilo beer belly.



'The biggest shock is my aerobic potential, rated "low". OK, I'm no Mo Farah, but but surely my aerobic capacity is at least middling'

We’ll skip the gory details – the dozens of races where I beat Matt with ease – and fast-forward to 2012. I had been training consistently for six years by now. Matt was swiftly catching up, but I still had a clear edge in any race of more than10 miles, so I decided to step up to the marathon. After putting in the hardest three months’ training of my life, I came away with a shiny new PB of 2hr 28 min 46 sec.

The point is not to revel in my glory. My time was decent club standard but hardly impressive against “proper” British marathoners, let alone African elites. The point is, it was amazing for me, given my widely presumed lack of ability. If only I had realised sooner that I had the potential …



Imagine someone had tested my genes as a podgy kid and told me: don’t worry, you’re an athlete inside, it’s only your Sherbet Dip Dab habit holding you back. What wonderful reassurance and motivation that would have been. But wait. What if they had looked at my results and said: sorry, it’s not through lack of effort that you are sub-mediocre – it’s down to your DNA. What then?



I was intrigued to find companies offering to do just that – test my DNA to determine my sporting potential. Could it really work? I decided to find out.



I got in touch with DNAFit, the leading provider, and asked if they would blind-test my DNA plus a few other samples. To my surprise, they said yes. A call to some friends with connections in elite sport secured a sample from a multi-Olympian and world champion runner (on condition I wouldn’t reveal his identity) — let’s call him Mr Swift — and another from pro cyclist James McLaughlin. If their results tallied with their achievements, I figured, DNA testing would be worth taking notice of.



Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mr Swift’s ‘medium’ result

A few weeks later the results were in. Swift’s read as follows: “Aerobic potential: medium”, which qualified as “an intermediate VO2max tendency”. Yet according to his physiologist, Swift’s VO2max is “above 77” – quite definitely not an intermediate score. Furthermore, the report deems his power/endurance profile as favouring power over endurance by a ratio of 70/30. Swift is one of the greatest endurance runners in the history of the sport. His injury risk, marked “medium”, is also at odds with the actual evidence. “He has had many, many injuries,” his physiologist confides. “I’d say his injury risk is untypically high.”



McLaughlin’s results are similarly at odds with his track record: his aerobic potential is rated “medium”, with a slight tendency towards power over endurance. “It doesn’t ring true at all,” McLaughlin tells me. “My VO2max is very high, nearly 82, and I’m a pure endurance rider – I fare far better in long, sustained efforts than in sprints.”



My own results also suggest a predisposition towards power rather than endurance, 56/47. This flies in the face of my running experience: I am hopeless at shorter, power-based events; the longer the race, the better I do (relative to others). The biggest shock is my aerobic potential, rated “low”. OK, I’m no Mo Farah, but surely my aerobic capacity is at least middling, or how could I have run a sub-2hr 30min marathon?



I owe it to DNAFit to give them a chance to explain – after all, they have been generous in blind-testing samples, opening themselves up to journalistic scrutiny. The company’s head of sport science is the former Olympic sprinter Craig Pickering, to whom I reveal the disparities between our results and our sporting track records.



“You almost certainly can’t use genes to tell who will be a good athlete or not a good athlete,” he responds. “There is no talent identification use in this.”

Fair enough, but our world-class marathon runner was rated as having “medium” aerobic potential.

“That’s a great example of how you can’t use genetics to tell you what sport you’ll be good at.”

OK, fine, so what can genetic testing tell us?



“What the tests and reports do is give you information on which to base your training, to have a better informed programme.”

Citing one DNAFit-supported study on a small group of athletes, Pickering says that the results provide enough information to guide training, either towards power (short, sharp) or endurance (longer, slower) sessions. This insight, he says, relates to genetically determined trainability – rate of fitness gain – rather than aptitude. Yet this wasn’t the impression I had been given by the reports, covered as they are with the word “potential”.

I stress my concern to Pickering that, had I received my apparently bleak results as a newcomer to running, my athletic ambitions might have been crushed. But he thinks I am missing the subtleties. “Because you have a low aerobic potential … we have options, we can fine-tune and target other areas like movement economy and efficiency.”

Low aerobic potential? We know that marathoners rely on their aerobic capacity, so surely this implies that my prospects were limited. “No, that isn’t what it means,” he replies. “I accept that ‘potential’ does imply that. The title should be changed. I often call it your aerobic trainability.”

By by this point, I have to admit, I am erring towards unconvinced. My scepticism deepens when I read the Athlome Project’s consensus statement on direct-to-consumer (DTC) DNA tests:

“The information provided by DTC is virtually meaningless for prediction and/or optimisation of sport performance. There is currently no evidence that existing genetic tests provide information that is useful regarding either predisposition for a particular sport, prediction of the training response likely to occur to a particular training programme, or predisposition to exercise-related injury.”

Athlome’s founder, Professor Yannis Pitsiladis, is even more damning: “These results are pointless, throw them away. There are no grounds for any of it.”



According to Pitsiladis, although there is vast, exciting scope for genetics-guided training, the science has a very long way to go: “We’re beginning to understand that performance is determined by hundreds, possibly even thousands of interacting genes. Even once they are known, we may not be able to make predictions with clinical significance; we will need to take into account the environmental factors as well.”

Countering the criticism from Pitsiladis and his Athlome colleagues, Pickering alleges sour grapes: “They’re annoyed that we’ve done it before them and that’s why they’re causing these problems. Their main goal was to sell genetic tests to people, in my opinion. They are frustrated that we’re one or two years ahead of them.”

Pitsiladis doesn’t deny having commercial interests in genetic testing but insists he is involved only in areas with demonstrable utility, such as using genetics to create improved anti-doping tests. He draws a sharp distinction between genetically testing elite athletes to assess their shared traits and testing amateurs who are almost as diverse a group as the general population.



“Parents who’ve failed as athletes go buy this stuff, desperate for their kids to succeed … Selling direct to consumers is the problem.”

That is precisely my concern, too. Can’t Pickering appreciate that for people such as myself, starting out as the unsporty sibling with every reason to doubt my genetic potential, my gloomy test results could have snuffed out my marathon dreams before I had even tried a 5k run?



“I share your concern,” he replies. “It’s something that, as a company, we try to communicate. Our reports use the word potential, and that needs to change … We have to do a better job, and we’ll continue to try.”

Make no mistake, talent matters. Athletes such as McLaughlin and Swift are prodigiously genetically blessed. My older brother, too, is a natural. He overtook me and became a far superior athlete, as I always suspected he would. But being the best you can be isn’t about biology, it is art as much as science. Talent isn’t destiny decipherable from DNA; it waits to be realised through hard work, like a sculpture inside a boulder. So don’t let anyone put you off – get hammering.

Trump again demands more NATO spending, mulls 'severe things' on North Korea

WARSAW U.S. President Donald Trump once more urged NATO allies in Europe on Thursday to spend more on defence, on a visit to Poland that had been billed as an opportunity for him to patch up relations after a tense alliance summit in May.

The Polish government is planning to bus people to Warsaw to ensure large crowds are there to listen to Donald Trump.

The US President is due to make an address in the Polish capital from Krasinski Square, a site which commemorates the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against the Nazis.

During his first official trip to Europe as US President, Mr Trump did not receive the warm welcome he would have liked.

In Brussels, thousands of people staged an anti-Trump protest hours after his arrival.

Last month, Mr Trump reportedly told Theresa May he would delay his state visit because of fears of large-scale protests.

But ahead of his visit to Poland, the ruling Law and Justice Party, admirers of Mr Trump and grateful for his decision to come to Warsaw before Paris, Brussels or Berlin, promised the White House cheering crowds, Polish media reports.

According to the Associated Press, ruling politicians and pro-government activists plan to bus in groups of people to cheer Mr Trump during his speech.

Some of the measures being taken are straight from the Communist Party playbook, hearkening back to the days of Soviet rule when crowds would be bussed to Warsaw to welcome visiting officials from Moscow.

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, Law and Justice Party member Dominik Tarcznski said: "It's going to be huge - absolutely huge. They just love him, the people in Poland - they just really love him."

Scores of people lined up the streets and waved American and Polish flags as Mr Trump's motorcade drove him and Melania to their hotel after they arrived on Wednesday night.

According to a survey released last week by the Pew Research Centre, 73 per cent of Poles have a favourable view of the US but just 23 per cent have confidence in Mr Trump, compared with 58 per cent at the end of Barack Obama's second term in office.

Poland is an ideal candidate to be a strong ally of Mr Trump. Its nationalistic right-wing government has a similar stance to the US President on issues such as immigration, climate change and coal mining. And the visit could offer Mr Trump a place to shine and gloss over his image as head of state.

Criticised by the EU for displaying authoritarian aspects to its government, Poland is one of the few Nato countries which meets the alliance's requirement to spend two per cent of its GDP on defence, and is a regular purchaser of US military equipment.

Polish approval could also be an asset at home, especially in states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where hundreds of thousands of Polish American voters live.

Despite the populist government, Poland has experienced steady growth for years and is rising to become an economic powerhouse in Europe.

But inside the EU, senior officials are reportedly concerned Mr Trump could boost far-right politicians in Europe.

Polish Defence Minister Antoni Macierewicz has said that like Mr Trump, Poland's government was being attacked by "liberals, post-communists, lefties and genderists".

He described Mr Trump as "a man who is changing the shape of the world's political scene".

Mr Trump is stopping in Poland on his way to the G20 summit in Germany, where he is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday.

But in Hamburg, Mr Trump could receive a very different reception, with 100,000 protesters expected.

The opinion polls got the 2015 election wrong, and the EU referendum, and Donald Trump’s victory in the US. Now, as they point to Theresa May winning a large majority on 8 June, why on earth should we believe them?

The short answer is that opinion polls are the worst way to find out what people think apart from any other. The alternatives to respectable polls are astrology, gut feeling or just asking people who are available. In this last category are internet polls open to anyone to enter, which can sometimes attract a large number of responses – although that usually means that a group on Facebook has organised like-minded people to take part. Such polls tell us nothing useful about the likely outcome of elections.

The only way to predict, roughly, how people might vote is to survey a representative sample of the electorate. At the moment, the average of all opinion polls compiled by Stephen Fisher of Oxford University suggests Theresa May is heading for a majority of 130. This is not a precise science, because of random variation and changes in politics, but it is much, much better than, say, reading tea leaves.

How can you tell anything from just 1,000 people?

If a sample of 1,000 people is representative of the whole country – by sex, age, income and region – it should give a fairly accurate picture of the country’s views. Pollsters adjust their findings if, for example, they don’t have enough middle-aged women in their sample, and they have to adjust voting intentions by how likely different social groups are to turn out on election day.

As a rule of thumb, findings will be within 3 percentage points of the true figure in 19 polls out of 20. This “margin of error” means that, for example, if a poll put Remain on 51 per cent, as the average final poll did in June 2016, it means you would expect Remain to be between 48 and 54 per cent. Unfortunately humans, including commentators, are bad at assessing probability in a close binary choice.

Why do the polls always get it wrong, then?

They don’t. In the first round of the French presidential election on 30 April, for example, the polls were astonishingly accurate, getting each candidate less than one percentage point out and, crucially, getting the order of the four closely bunched candidates right. British polls are not usually that accurate. Getting truly representative samples is hard, as is predicting the likelihood of different groups to turn out to vote. But they are not “terrible” as Nate Silver, the US polling guru, recently claimed.

It is not as if US polls are perfect. National polls were not too bad, correctly predicting that Hillary Clinton would win more votes, but the state polls were up to three points out in the places that made the difference in the electoral college.

Rob Ford of Manchester University replied to Silver, pointing out that at least British polls tend to err in the same direction, of overstating the Labour vote. I’m not sure how reassuring this is. In many ways the big problem for British polls is that they got the 2010 election nearly right, whereas in other recent elections they got the Labour-Conservative gap at least five points wrong in Labour’s favour. Most of the polling companies have changed their methods since 2015, but we won’t know until 8 June whether their figures are over-corrected, roughly right or still too pro-Labour.

How come I’ve never been polled?

Most polling now is done online, so if you are not a member of an internet panel, you would be polled only by phone. At a rough guess, there might be a 1 in 20 chance that your landline or mobile would be called in a year, but most people hang up on cold calls, so perhaps only 1 in 100 people would actually be surveyed.

Polling companies are all biased, aren’t they?

Now we are getting into the field of paranoid conspiracy theory. A fringe of Corbyn supporters online assert that YouGov is owned by Conservatives and enjoy quoting Peter Hitchens – the Mail on Sunday columnist – of all people saying that polls are used to manipulate public opinion not to measure it. YouGov was co-founded by Peter Kellner, a Labour supporter. In any case, as we have seen, election polls have tended to overstate Labour support. Any polling company that is a member of the British Polling Council has to follow its rules, including on openness, so that all their work can be scrutinised.

We should read polls carefully, but celebrate the unpredictability of human beings, who – thank goodness – can always surprise us.

Both politically and culturally, 2016 was a turbulent year and the Oxford English Dictionary has recognised this in its latest update, with "woke" and "post-truth" now included.

The original meaning of woke is to awaken after sleep but the word now has a political meaning after being taken up by the Black Lives Matter movement.

"By the mid-20th century," says the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), "woke had been extended figuratively to refer to being 'aware' or 'well informed' in a political or cultural sense."

'Woke' and 'post-truth' made it into the dictinary. Well doesn't that sum up 2017. — LisaMuggeridge (@LisaMuggeridge) June 27, 2017

"Post-truth" has been chosen as the OED's word of 2016 - to reflect a year that included political shocks such as the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union and the US election of President Donald Trump.

It is defined as "relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping political debate or public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief".

There is also a new word right at the end of the dictionary, Zyzzyva - the name of a genus of tropical weevils native to South America and typically found near palm trees.

"No one knows where zyzzyva came from," said Fiona McPherson, the OED's new words editor.

"There are some sources saying it makes a reference to the noises made by the weevil."

More than 600 new words, phrases, and senses have been added this time around, with other highlights including Danish way of life "hygge" and a number of tennis terms in time for Wimbledon including "bagel", "changeover" and "career slam".

Fans of television series The West Wing may be pleased to hear that "thing" is now a thing.

"A new usage of 'thing' refers to questions conveying surprise or incredulity, such as: 'How can that be a thing?'" Oxford University Press said.

It was traced back to an early episode of Aaron Sorkin's show.

The V&A Exhibition Road Quarter, a project that has been six years in the making and marks the first major construction work at the museum in almost a century, opens to the public this week. Designed by architect Amanda Levete and her practice AL_A, it not only adds a vast new exhibition space – set to be one of the largest temporary galleries in the UK – but additional entrances and an impressive courtyard that pays tribute to the London landmark's storied history.

Image 2 of 3 Credits © Hufton + Crow

The latter takes its cues from the V&A's rich connection with ceramics and is the world's first all-porcelain public courtyard, painstakingly constructed from over 11,000 handmade tiles. The creation of the Sackler Courtyard has unveiled several significant facades and details that have never before been on display to the public. Among these is a sgraffito decoration on the side of the Henry Cole Wing; created by the first art students at the museum in the late 19th century, it employs a Renaissance technique involving multiple layers of coloured plaster scratched away to reveal a design. Meanwhile a newly created colonnade, opening up a new approach to the building, has been formed around the Aston Webb screen, a Grade I-listed structure originally built to conceal the museum's Victorian boilers. The building suffered damage to the stonework during World War 2, with this reflected in such details as the new metal gates that feature perforations traced from the imprint of shrapnel.

Other elements are set to redefine how visitors make their way around this well-known institution. The Blavatnik Hall is a new entrance that fronts onto Exhibition Road, and will provide new connections between the museum's sprawling galleries and collections. Meanwhile the 1,100sq metre Sainsbury Gallery, which reaches 18metres below ground, brings the V&A firmly into the modern age, not only architecturally but also in creating a vast and flexible space that enables them to host a changing roster of large-scale exhibitions.

You'll have to wait until September for the first to take residency in the gallery; entitled Opera: Passion, Power and Politics, it takes in some of the music genre's greatest moments in an interactive display created in collaboration with the Royal Opera House. However, until 7 July there's a chance to get a sneak peek into the space with the Reveal Festival. This free, week-long event is a testament to the V&A's wide-ranging cultural offering, bringing together such talents as fashion designer Molly Goddard, who's work will be showcased in four special catwalk shows, a site-specific dance performance by Julie Cunningham and Company and music from broadcasting platform Boiler Room.

There have been a few encounters in the lead up to my stay at The Olsen, Melbourne, that have made me feel like an unsavoury character indulging in an illicit episode.

From the email I send asking what time the camera will be delivered to my room, to the numerous questions I have to pluck up the courage to ask at the check-in desk (“Do I get to choose the photo? Is the camera on a timer? How will I receive the print?”), it’s all slightly uncomfortable. Still, I have to concede that it’s also a bit of a thrill.

Like so many female greats before me – Botticelli’s Venus, Raphael’s Three Graces, Kim Kardashian’s, well, Kim Kard-ass-ian – I am about to become a work of nude art. But unlike those immortalised by Renaissance painters, no one has actually commissioned a piece of me in my birthday suit: I am merely masquerading as a muse through the Art Series Hotel Group’s ‘No Robe’ package.

It’s the latest campaign from the playful, Australian-based collection of boutique hotels, strewn across the metropolitan hubs of Victoria, South Australia and Queensland. The idea is this: guests abandon their inhibitions (and clothes), allowing a team of artists to transform their naked limbs into a sketch.

Thankfully, said team of artists are not sitting waiting in your room ready to inspect your body parts. Instead, from the privacy of your temporary residence – and at your own leisure – you use an in-room iPad and a custom-built app to take whatever naked shots your heart desires.

As the name would suggest, the hotel group is quite an authority when it comes to art. Each of its seven hotels is inspired by – and wholly dedicated to – a contemporary Australian artist. Their original artworks and prints line lobbies and halls, and a smattering of unique and thoughtful design elements are incorporated into rooms.

My studio suite at The Olsen, situated just south of the Yarra River in Melbourne, features a smoked screen between bed and bathroom with John Olsen’s signature tangle of wild brushstrokes dancing across it. There’s even a miniature art library in the corner of each chamber, offering greater insight into the works of the hotel’s namesake.

Chloe was ‘unexpectedly pleased’ with her nude sketch (Art Series Hotels )

The mini-chain of hotels is no stranger to outlandish campaigns; over Christmas 2015, it offered an ‘Overstay Check-Out’, allowing guests who booked at least a one-night stay the opportunity to remain as long as their room was available without paying anything more.

‘No Robe’, for its part, fits so snugly with the hotel group’s art theme that, by the time I reach my room, any preconceived notions of seediness evaporate.

I’m all aflutter at the numerous office blocks that appear to overlook my floor-to-ceiling windows. The prudish Brit in me prances semi-nude about the room, aware that I need to master a pose stat, but also conscious that an unsuspecting white-collar worker on overtime might be about to get the fright of their life.

After finally settling on a pose that best meets my desired trifecta of tasteful, non-revealing and flattering, I set to work typing my details into the app before facing off with the camera.

Anyone who has dabbled in the occasional sext will realise just how many attempts it can take to master the ‘natural’ look: a lot. The gulf between the mental image I’ve conjured of my unclothed form and the digital evidence is rather sizable. iPad units are loaned to hotel guests for up to two hours, but I can assure you that for such an intimate study of your own anatomy 30 minutes is more than enough.

Eventually, I give up on trying to create a flawless picture and relax, feeling a little more at home in my own skin and settling on a shot that I feel is as good as any. All I can do is pray my artist is of the more forgiving J S Lowry stickman school of design, rather than the anatomically correct Leonardo da Vinci persuasion.

Totally unveiling all your bits isn’t a prerequisite – the hotel also invites guests to ‘Robe Up’ if they’re feeling too bashful. But it doesn’t seem to be a problem for your archetypal laidback Aussie: even on Instagram, punters are taking to the task with verve. The ‘No Robe’ hashtag is a door to a cornucopia of artsy and er, less artsy, shots, with lodgers proudly displaying their wares.

“With the great views of South Yarra, people have been having fun with it,” the receptionist notes as she reports back to pick up the iPad.

When the much-anticipated sketch arrives in the post several weeks later, I feel unexpectedly pleased with the result: my face moody yet elfin, my form flatteringly contoured.

If anything, having my limbs inked indelibly and artistically onto card makes me want to be a muse all over again.

Staying there

The No Robe package is available at any of the Art Series Hotels (artserieshotels.com.au) until June 15. Doubles from £130, room-only basis.

BRUSSELS The European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier warned British ministers and businesses who are calling for "frictionless trade" with the EU after Britain leaves that is "not possible".

Addressing an EU business forum in Brussels on Thursday, Barnier said London's "red lines" for a future trade relationship meant Britain was definitely leaving the single market and the customs union, and only membership of both allowed "frictionless" trading arrangements.

But Britain will stick by its aim to get a comprehensive free trade deal and customs agreement with the EU to ensure that trade is "as frictionless as possible" once it has left the bloc, a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said.

Barnier said he was unsure the EU's refusal to grant single market access piecemeal and insistence on control of standards in the single market "have been fully understood across the Channel".

"I have heard some people in the UK argue that one can leave the single market and keep all of its benefits - that is not possible," he said. "I have heard some people in the UK argue that one can leave the single market and build a customs union to achieve 'frictionless trade' – that is not possible."

Stressing that time was tight for a deal by the time Britain automatically leaves the bloc on March 30, 2019 - "time flies", he said. Barnier said he was ready to handle a failure of talks and "no deal" but that would be damaging, especially to Britain, and he saw "no reasonable justification" for it.

"A fair deal is far better than no deal," he said, turning around a phrase popularised by May that no deal is better than a bad deal.

He called for rapid agreement on priority issues in talks begun last month to build a "climate of trust" so that trade negotiations could begin as soon as possible. But in urging businesses to prepare for Brexit now, he stressed that whatever deal was done would carry "significant consequences".

"A trading relationship with a country that does not belong to the European Union obviously involves friction," Barnier said. He cited disruption to cross-border traders processing value-added tax (VAT) and a need for all EU imports of animals and animal products to be tested at borders.

Those issues are of particular concern in Ireland, where farming businesses on either side of the new UK-EU border on the island fear disruption. Barnier repeated EU willingness to make a priority of agreeing border issues on Ireland, where leaders on all sides fear a "hard" frontier could also undermine the fragile peace in the British province of Northern Ireland.

The EU's conclusion of a free trade deal with Japan on Thursday was hailed by EU leaders as a sign of what the combined economic power of the bloc can achieve - and of what Britain will miss when it leaves.

"In the context of the discussion about Brexit, we have heard statements claiming that it isn't worth being in the European Union, as it is easier to do global trade outside of the EU," European Council President Donald Tusk said.

"Today we have shown that this is not true," he said.

EU Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan said the deal which will open Japan to European high-value food and drink exports, "shows the importance of size in global trade negotiations".

"No individual member state could ever hope to achieve what the EU can achieve together," Hogan said.

The EU hopes it will take effect in early 2019, just when Britain is leaving. London, where Trade Secretary Liam Fox welcomed the EU-Japan deal, may seek to emulate its benefits for the likes of Britain's hugely valuable Scotch whisky exports.

Not many hotels in Britain can rival No Man's Fort in terms of location. Stranded in the Solent, just off the coast of Portsmouth, the circular fort rises abruptly from teal waters that crash against its base. Approaching the fort by boat, its brutal exterior – all sea-weathered concrete, iron plates and railings – looks like the most unlikely setting for a top class hotel. But step onto the metal stairs and through the fort's main doors and any fears you might have that you'll be roughing it out at sea are soon forgotten.

No Man's Fort is one of a series of sea forts commissioned by Lord Palmerston in the 19th century to protect Britain from a French invasion. They were never needed for that purpose, but continued to be manned until the 1940s when they were decommissioned and left derelict.

Over the years they've changed hands but barely seen any activity, apart from hosting some seriously hardcore 1990s raves. Then Mike Clare, the entrepreneur behind Dreams beds, bought them all with the aim of adapting them into luxury hotels.

The smallest fort, Spitbank, opened in 2012 after a major revamp. It has just eight bedrooms and offers 24-hour packages for guests. No Man's Fort followed in 2015. It's three times the size of Spitbank, with 22 bedrooms.

We set off from Portsmouth harbour at midday and arrived at No Man's Fort 45 minutes later. Within minutes we were sipping prosecco in the hotel's glass-roofed atrium. The fort's exterior is brutal, but the inside is very civilised with cream furnishings, wicker furniture and wooden floors. Nautical features abound, such as knotted ropes and lifesaver rings, and there are deckchairs scattered here and there.

First came the tour of our digs for the day. We descended to the fort's lowest level, a network of corridors and rooms that is the most unrestored part of the building. Our guide Vicky explained how soldiers would toil away rigging up vast cannons (of which there is a replica). But these historic rooms also have another surprising function – they play host to Laser Quest for large corporate groups.

Back upstairs we were taken through the games room and cards room. The fort is structured with exposed brick walls that still bear the wrought-iron hooks that were once used by sailors to put cannons in place. Dotted around the circumference are gun ports that are now windows. Imagine the place without sofas and lighting and you get a real sense of how arduous and isolated life was for those posted here.

Finally, we were taken to the fort's highlight: the top deck. Here artificial grass is laid out and decorated with park benches, two hot tubs, a boules pit and a helipad. Standing tall is the lighthouse where we took in the 360 degree view: in one direction is the Isle of Wight, in another Portsmouth Harbour. The clouds that had masked the sky in the morning disappeared, allowing us to see as far as the New Forest.

Lunch, consisting of salads, seafood and pasta, was taken in a cobbled passage of a restaurant called La Resistance. Then the afternoon was ours.

There's something wonderful about knowing that you're stranded at sea. There's no guilt about staying put rather than exploring the surroundings because there's nowhere to go. Unless there's an emergency you can only leave when the boat comes to collect you the next day. So we took advantage of the isolation, spending the afternoon sitting on the top deck and drinking beer in the sunshine. When the light began to fade we slipped into the fort's hot tub – also on the top deck – and watched the sun descend into the horizon.

At 7.30pm all guests are instructed to gather for drinks and canapes in the atrium before dinner is served at 8pm. Bizarrely, we were left for over an hour while others around us are whisked away to dinner. Later we discovered that the logistical problem of feeding 40-plus mouths simultaneously means that seating times have to be staggered. Hopefully this system will be improved – we sat with hungry eyes looking jealously as others made their way to the dining room before us.

Finally, at 9pm, we were taken to our table in the 'mess hall', a spacious, candle-lit area decorated with sailors' uniforms hanging from hooks.

The food that the kitchen rustled up was seriously good. A starter of goat's cheese was jazzed up with quince terrine, hazelnut praline and beetroot jam. Pheasant and chanterelle terrine with sourdough croute, cider pickled mushroom and white truffle oil was elegant and rich.

But the mains were the real stars of the show. I tucked into a grilled hake fillet with crushed potato, fennel pollen vegetables drenched in crab bisque. My partner opted for the roasted rump of salt aged lamb, accompanied with Dauphinoise potato, candy baby beets, heritage carrots, and a redcurrant jus.

Classic desserts on offer include a sticky toffee pudding (perfect) and a chocolate pot de creme with chocolate biscotti.

After dinner, we crawled back up to the top deck where a fire pit was blazing and marshmallows were being toasted over it. Wrapping ourselves in blankets, we joined the other guests, sipping hot chocolate laced with rum underneath a clear night sky.

On our way to bed, we passed an empty cabaret bar, where disco lights were spinning out into a barren space. On some evenings the fort hosts themed party evenings but nothing was going on the night we were there. The room felt a bit out of kilter with the rest of the hotel, a little Butlins.

Our bedroom was spacious and pleasantly modest, with a cast-iron bed, striped wallpaper, a cream carpet and an original vaulted ceiling. After leaving our blinds open, we woke with a seemingly-endless view out across the channel.

Breakfast was served at 8.30am. With one last glance at the lighthouse to take in that stupendous view, we descended the metal stairway, clambered onto the boat and were whisked back to shore.

At a mountain hut at just over 3,000 metres, the only place for teeth-brushing is outside, in full ski gear. They were ablutions with a tempting view, a safe distance from the slight pong of the outhouse. To my left and right I could make out a jagged skyline, sawing at the dull glow of the night sky. And above – of great encouragement after two days of fog, wind, temperatures of -20C and dashed plans – a million stars as sharp as pins.

Sleep was deep inside the Gandegghütte, above Zermatt and a little over a mile, as the crow flies, from the Italian border. By day it’s a charmingly rustic lunch spot, and at night it falls silent to welcome the more intrepid to its cosy living quarters and bunk rooms. The thick duvets provided (you don’t have to be that intrepid) kept out the cold but the dinner of hörnli-gratin, an obscenely cheesy macaroni with minced pork, could have warmed the blood of a mammoth for a month.

An early-morning curtain twitch revealed the promise of the night before: a dazzling mountainscape, peaks and ridges catching fire as the sun began its climb. The Matterhorn caught the most of the morning glow, its pyramid peak lying just three miles to the west. Barely 100 metres to the east, the hut-sized blue chunks of the Theodul Glacier continued their imperceptible journey down the mountain.

The remote Gandegghütte (Zermatt Tourism)



Ideally the morning would have started with an awakening descent through fresh snow, or a warming climb on the skins I had lugged round with me for two days. As it was, the challenging conditions until that sunny day had shunted our itinerary from plan A to B, C and most of the alphabet. But things were looking up; I had a helicopter to catch. So we joined the queue at the Trockener Steg lift station just below the hut. (The Gandegg might have been remote when it was first built in 1885, but has since been absorbed into the Zermatt ski area).

Soon I was higher still on the Plateau Rosa and in a huddle with my guides, Francis Kelsey and Severin Marchand. The helicopter was in high demand for single lifts; much of the region’s best terrain had been off-limits for days, but perfect conditions brought out the sun-seekers and thrill-seekers in grateful hordes. We were heading to one of the classic descents just across the border in Italy, the Château des Dames, a manageable 1,600m drop on north-facing slopes where snow stays good for days. We were the second group up and acres of undisturbed powder awaited our twitching toes as we clipped in at the top, the quiet all the more rewarding after the return of the helicopter to find its next group.

The helicopter drops one group off before heading off to pick up another (Simon Usborne)



This was what I had signed up for – great snow between great food amid great views. It had been hard-fought for, thanks to the conditions, which made me all the more grateful for the fleet-footedness that was the trip’s selling point. Skiing has always been a lottery. You book months in advance, commit yourself to one place for a week, and hope for the best. But the industry is beginning to wake up to the demand for flexibility, particularly for off-piste skiers whose priority is good snow.

Francis, our American born guide, who has spent a career skiing and climbing in the Alps, is increasingly working with clients who book flights to Geneva or Zurich, say, and then wait for as long as possible before committing to an itinerary. Ski safaris, which might take in multiple resorts and countries, and include climbing or helicopter lifts, can cost more, but deals can also be found at the last minute. And if the payback is the freedom to chase the good snow, it’s worth testing a budget’s upper limit.

Kelsey says hotels and restaurants are starting to adapt to this demand, moving away from the rigorous traditions of seven-day bookings. He says the effects of sites like Booking.com and Airbnb was already forcing this change. Weeks before my trip, he had a group which had booked their base hotel in Gressoney in the Aosta Valley. But there was no snow so they switched to Lech in Austria at the last minute. “Even the best-laid plans can change,” he said. “Mother Nature decides in the end.”

Good snow is worth stretching your budget for (Simon Usborne)



The resulting logistical demands on the mountain guide can be severe but Kelsey had support on my trip from Ben Shearer and Hamish Gordon-Lennox, my hosts. Both lifelong skiers, they are more used to warmer climes as the men behind the well-known Peligoni Club on Zakynthos in Greece. But last season they launched Peligoni Ski, exhorting their summer clientele – and more punters besides – to join them in the mountains. They will book you in and look after everything.

One disadvantage of the safari approach is balancing the desire to have plentiful changes of clothes and the need to ski light. I got it slightly wrong when we checked into the rather pretentious White Angel hotel in Cervinia and I re-emerged into the smart bar after a well-deserved hot shower wearing my thermal leggings. The old boy crooning in the corner with his guitar almost did a double-take. But it mattered less as the Prosecco flowed and concern diverted to our planned return to Zermatt the next day, which would require taking cable cars vulnerable to the forecast return of high winds. Without them, our flights home were in jeopardy.

We made it in the end, leaping through a morning weather window and returning to the resort and the hotel where we had begun our journey, the Mont Cervin, one of Zermatt’s oldest. As well as being one of Switzerland’s most charming destinations, with its motor-free roads served by quaint little electric cars, Zermatt also has a decent set-up for adventure skiers (you could do a lot of financial damage at the excellent Yosemite Zermatt shop).

As we repacked our bags, our arrival two days earlier seemed like a distant memory. But thanks to some smart planning and quick-thinking, a weekend of challenging conditions had become a triumph of luxury interspersed with mountain-hut adventure and, after that heli lift, the run of the season.

Travel essentials

Getting there

Simon Usborne travelled with Peligoni Ski, which offers a four-night ski safari starting in Zermatt from £2,450pp including flights from London, rail transfers, accommodation, one heli drop, guides and full touring equipment.

BEIRUT A suicide bomber in Syria's Hama killed two people and injured nine others on Thursday, state media said, in the second such attack in a government-held city this week.

State television said the attacker set off an explosive belt at a bus station in the southwest of the city.

The governor of Hama said the explosion killed two women, according to another state-run channel, Ikhbariya. It had quoted him earlier as saying three people had died.

On Sunday, a bomb killed 20 people and wounded dozens more in Damascus.

Since the start of the year, a string of blasts have hit the cities of Damascus and Homs, which are under the control of President Bashar al-Assad's government fighting rebel groups in the country's six-year war.

US President-elect Donald Trump has suggested that Nigel Farage would do a “great job” as the UK's ambassador in Washington. Here are some of the key questions around Mr Trump's latest indication that he will not play by the usual diplomatic rules.



How did the leader of Ukip, a party which has just one MP in the Commons, become a key player in the future of US-UK relations?

Mr Trump drew inspiration for his success from the UK's vote to leave the European Union and saw a kindred spirit in the Ukip leader, who had also employed populist, anti-establishment, anti-immigration rhetoric to secure an electoral upset. The bond was strengthened as Mr Trump dubbed himself “Mr Brexit” and the Ukip leader flew over to Mississippi to address a rally for the Republican candidate. Following Mr Trump's victory in the electoral race, Mr Farage became the first British politician to meet the new president-elect.

How close are the ties between the Trump and Farage camps?

The Breitbart news website provides a transatlantic link between the two men. The strident right-wing website's executive chairman was Steve Bannon, who played a leading role in the Trump campaign and has been named as the president-elect's chief strategist. The website's British counterpart is edited by Raheem Kassam, a former aide to Mr Farage who was briefly a candidate in Ukip's latest leadership contest. Mr Kassam was part of the group - styling themselves as the Brex Pistols - who accompanied Mr Farage on the visit to Trump Tower.

What has Number 10 had to say about Mr Trump's suggestion?

A spokesman stressed that “there is no vacancy” in Washington because “we already have an excellent ambassador to the US”. Downing Street stressed that “as a basic principle, we appoint our ambassadors”.

So who is the “excellent ambassador”?

Sir Kim Darroch, a veteran diplomat, took up the Washington post in January. Before that, he served as David Cameron's national security adviser from 2012 to 2015 and his former roles include being the UK's permanent representative to the European Union. Traditionally, ambassadors to Washington remain in post for four years, but it is not uncommon for them to serve more than one term. Mr Farage has dismissed Sir Kim as an “arch-europhile”.

What does Sir Kim think of Mr Trump?

A leaked memo suggested the diplomat believed British influence could shape Mr Trump's thinking. The document, obtained by the Sunday Times, was reportedly written by Sir Kim in the immediate aftermath of Mr Trump's election win. It said Mr Trump was “above all an outsider and unknown quantity, whose campaign pronouncements may reveal his instincts, but will surely evolve and, particularly, be open to outside influence if pitched right”. Sir Kim added: “Having, we believe, built better relationships with his team than have the rest of Washington diplomatic corps, we should be well placed to do this.”

MUMBAI (Reuters Breakingviews) - It is hard to let go of a unicorn. Indian e-commerce firm Snapdeal has rejected a roughly $850 million takeover offer from its larger rival Flipkart, a person familiar with the situation told Breakingviews. A sale at this price would fall short of the startup industry’s magical $1 billion-plus mark, let alone the peak valuation of $6.5 billion Snapdeal hit more than a year ago. But the rebuff is probably a mistake: buyers are scarce and a delay is only likely to lead to a lower price.

Japan's SoftBank is the largest shareholder and has been pushing for a quick sale. But it needs the support of other investors including Snapdeal's founders, as it does not control the board of the country's number three e-commerce player. A sale will hurt in the short-run given the technology conglomerate has spent around $1 billion on Snapdeal at valuations up to an estimated $5 billion. However, Reuters reports that founder Masayoshi Son wants to invest a further $1 billion to become a top shareholder in the enlarged entity.

Throwing good money after bad has some logic for the Japanese. The merged group could later be combined with the retail unit of Paytm, another industry player that is backed by Alibaba, the Chinese giant already part-owned by SoftBank. If the end result is a profitable, dominant outfit, that would also help to preserve SoftBank's boasting rights. Leaving aside Alibaba, the Japanese company claims to have earned a 43 percent cumulative return over the past 18 years on internet investments worth $7 billion. At this point, Snapdeal looks like a blot on that record.

With Amazon the only other significant player in the industry, Snapdeal has a poor negotiating position. Flipkart already counts powerhouses like China's Tencent, U.S. marketplace eBay, and Microsoft among its investors. Holdouts may be disappointed with the valuation on the table, and possibly other terms and conditions. But one thing is almost certain: the longer this sale drags out the less Snapdeal will look like a unicorn.

Gold is continuing to wane against a backdrop of rising rates speculation and rising bond yields, but was inching higher this morning in response to global political tensions.

The spot gold price was trading at $1,222 an ounce at the time of writing, up 0.4 per cent for the session but only after it hit an eight-week low of $1,217 earlier on.

It was at $1,225 two days ago on the back of its first monthly loss this year in June.

Gold's problems stem from the expectation of rising interest rates and tighter monetary policy, as well as the reality that this is already happening, albeit gradually, in the US.

James Steel, an analyst at HSBC, pointed to comments last week from US, Eurozone and UK policymakers on global "reflation", says Bullion Vault. [https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-news/gold-bullion-070520172]

This has been driving down demand and prices for bonds, which pushes up yields. Gold is inversely correlated to bond yields and also responds negatively to rising rates as it does not offer any income and so its opportunity cost increases.

The most recent declines for gold are seen to be in correlation with rising eurozone bond yields.

The reason gold has failed to move any further, however, is that some traders are keen on its "safe haven" appeal in the wake of simmering geopolitical tensions following this week's missile test by North Korea.

Gold is near its 200-day moving average and its next big move could be decisive, experts believe.

The precious metal is in a "tug of war between this reflation narrative [and] rising geopolitical tensions," says Kamal Sharma, a currency strategist at the US investment bank Merrill Lynch.

Gold price sees first monthly loss of 2017

03 July

Gold hit a seven-week low today after recovering its first monthly trading loss so far this year.

Trading was down 1.2 per cent to below $1,226 an ounce, its lowest level since 12 May.

The metal rose above its 200-day moving average price in early May, prompting it to go on a prolonged rally that saw it gain around $50 an ounce over three weeks, Reuters reports.

However, it has "declined steadily ever since", being hit more recently by a rise in bond yields at a time of rising interest rates.

The US Federal Reserve increased interest rates for the second time this year last month and are projected to increase them again at least once more before the end of 2017.

Rates rises decrease the relative value of fixed-income assets, which reduces demand, hits prices and ups yields.

Gold tends to be positively correlated with bond prices - and so negatively correlated with yields - because it offers no income and loses lustre when rates are rising.

Also hitting gold today has been a recovery for the dollar after a poor run, as concerns ease over global political issues, including the UK government's stability.

Trading is back near its 200-day moving average, which means analysts are closely watching whether prices find support and rebound or continue to slide, potentially presaging a more significant decline.

"The political front is likely to attract continued demand, but [that is] currently not strong enough to offset the impact of rising yields," Saxo Bank's Ole Hansen said.

Gold price at four-week low as focus shifts to rates

19 June

The gold price fell to a four-week low today, marking a near-$50 retreat from its highs earlier this month.

The fall was set in motion at the end of last week in the wake of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates for the second time this year. Hints of a possible third rise in the coming months are also affecting trading.

While the Fed's move was widely expected, it's seen as being increasingly hawkish on rates – and higher rates hurt non-yielding assets like gold relative to income-bearing alternatives.

Bloomberg says that some hedge funds had anticipated the move. They traded net long positions (bets on prices being higher in the future) down by more than ten per cent ahead of the Fed's Open Markets Committee meeting last week.

The precious metal was trading a little below $1,295 an ounce earlier this month and was on course to set a new 2017 high.

Today it's still edging lower. At the time of writing, it's changing hands at around $1,248 an ounce – its lowest level since 24 May, according to Reuters.

Alongside the rates focus – which also has the effect of boosting the dollar against which gold is negatively correlated – a confluence of geopolitical issues that was driving trader uncertainty appears to have dissipated.

When traders are nervous they tend to turn to gold, which is famously a safe haven at times of stress.

Issues that were a source of concern include the increasingly bellicose rhetoric between Donald Trump and North Korea, and the James Comey scandal that was seen as having the potential to bring down Trump's administration.

These issues have not gone away completely, however. Uncertainty in Europe remains high after the UK election result which will see the Brexit talks finally get underway.

Reuters says traders are currently seeing a range-bound trade for gold, with resistance at $1,260 an ounce and support for the 100-day average price of $1,248, or the 200-day average of $1,240.

Gold price could rise to $1,300 on political uncertainty

6 June

The gold price was close to its highest levels in 2007 this afternoon, raising the possibility it could top $1,300 an ounce as political uncertainty linked to the UK, Europe and the US mounts.

Spot gold was a little below $1,293 an ounce after earlier hitting around $1,294.

"Generally light positioning and numerous upcoming geopolitical events should continue to underpin demand for the metal," Sam Laughlin, a senior precious metals trader at MKS, said in a note reported by Reuters.

He added that targets for the metal were now "extending to the 2017 high around $1,295 and the psychological level of $1,300 above this".

Today's move up is attributed to a fall in Treasury yields and the dollar in response to "political uncertainty from the United States to the Middle East", reports Reuters.

Gold is negatively correlated to the dollar, against which it's held as a hedge. It also tends to benefit from political anxiety due to the belief that it's a safe haven" in times of stress.

A "political rift" between Saudi Arabia and its allies and Qatar "may force oil prices lower and remove some of the inflationary pressures" that could prompt interest rate rises.

Gold is also inversely correlated to interest rates as it doesn't offer an income yield and therefore loses ground when rates are higher.

Elsewhere, a political "super Thursday" looms: "British voters will also go to polls in an increasingly unpredictable general election, the European Central Bank is due to meet and… former FBI director James Comey will testify before Congress".

Reuters adds: "The events all have the potential to boost the safe-haven appeal of bullion, which is often used as an investment option during times of political and financial uncertainty."

Gold prices respond to poor US jobs data

5 June

The gold price jumped by more than one per cent on Friday and jumped again this morning as it hit its highest level in six weeks following a weak US jobs report on Friday.

Spot gold rose by 1.1 per cent in New York in the final trading session of last week. At the time of writing, it is up by 0.3 per cent for the day at above $1,280 an ounce.

Reuters says the metal peaked at $1,282 an ounce earlier this morning, its highest level since 21 April.

On Friday, the US Labor Department announced the economy had added 138,000 jobs in May, a figure well below the 180,000 expected by economists.

"Official job creation figures for March and April were also revised down," says the BBC.

Strong jobs growth is one of the main indicators of a steadily improving US economy. As such, the official monthly updates are keenly watched for signals of the likely path of US interest rates.

If employment, and the economy in general, continue to improve, rates rises might gather pace. This would be bad news for non-yielding gold, whose opportunity cost goes up when rates are higher.

Friday's figures are being interpreted as a sign that the path of rates rises could be slower.

Reuters says that political anxiety linked to the London terror attacks at the weekend and the tightening UK general election polls is "supporting" gold's advance.

The BBC reports, however, that the unemployment rate in the US fell again last month to 4.3 per cent, meaning its apparent cooling could be a sign of the economy approaching "full employment".

Traders still believe a rates rise is very likely to happen soon. Market bets on a second rise this year at the Federal Reserve's June meeting next week are running at 95 per cent, says the Financial Times.

This in turn suggests that if the central bank believes the jobs data miss is sufficient reason to keep rates on hold again, the market could undergo a sizeable correction that would be likely to push the yellow metal higher again.

Gold price surges as crisis engulfs Trump

18 May

The gold price is surging on renewed safe-haven demand as a major crisis engulfing Donald Trump delivers a sizable hit to the stock markets.

Talk of impeachment hangs in the air in Washington following allegations over possible links between the administration and Russia and former FBI director James Comey's accusations that the US President tried to interfere with a bureau investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Markets have risen since Trump's election last November in order to factor policies that could stimulate the economy, including a radical programme of tax cuts and infrastructure spending.

"The news out of Washington is alerting markets to the rising implementation risk associated with the pro-growth policies that have already been priced into markets," Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to Allianz, told the Financial Times.

"The more this occurs, the greater the downward pressure on stocks, the dollar and government bond yields."

Yesterday, the S&P 500 fell 1.8 per cent, while the volatility index, a measure of market fear, jumped 45 per cent and the dollar "slid to its lowest level since Trump was elected".

Gold, on the other hand, was up close to $30 to hit a two-week high of $1,264 an ounce. Spot gold was holding around $1,255 at the time of writing.

Trading had been recovering recently as a result of geopolitical tensions relating to Trump's rhetoric over North Korean missile tests, but had settled somewhat of late.

Gold price bounces back as US economy disappoints

16 May

The gold price hit a two-week high yesterday as it bounced back for the fourth consecutive session on the back of poor US economic data.

Having tempered some of those gains overnight, trading rose again this afternoon and was 0.5 per cent higher at $1,235 an ounce.

Gold had been under pressure following the apparent subsiding of global political uncertainty with the election of Emmanuel Macron in France and the cessation of rhetorical hostilities between US President Donald Trump and his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong-un.

As the metal is a store of value in times of stress, it had previously benefitted from "safe-haven" buying.

However, says Reuters, some of that global political tension has returned with North Korea launching another missile test, accusations that Trump leaked state secrets to Russia and the massive "ransomware" cyber attack around the world.

But gold is mostly reacting to a fall in the value of the dollar, which the Financial Times says hit a five-month low today on the back of poor economic data.

Included in the weak recent figures were underwhelming reports on inflation and retail sales on Friday, which both missed analyst expectations, and a drop in New York manufacturing output.

Gold is often held as a hedge against the currency and consequently is negatively correlated to the dollar. Weak economic data also counts against the case for more rapid interest rate rises and non-yielding assets such as gold do better when rates stay low.

"Spot gold may rise more to $1,245 per ounce, as it has cleared a resistance at $1,233," says Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.

French Open semi-finalist Dominic Thiem takes on France's Gilles Simon at Wimbledon on Thursday, hoping to make inroads into what has been the weakest grand slam for one of the so-called next generation of men's tennis.

The 23-year-old Austrian eighth seed produced one of his finest displays on clay to knock out holder Novak Djokovic in Paris last month, only to come up against the immovable obstacle of Rafa Nadal in the last four.

But in his past three Wimbledon appearances, Thiem has not made it past the second round - a run he will be hoping to end against 32-year-old Simon, who is ranked 36th in the world.

Roger Federer, Milos Raonic, Novak Djokovic and Angelique Kerber are also in action.

ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) STORY: New Yorkers and tourists in Times Square took a trip back in time on Tuesday (June 27), courtesy of repurposed phone booths outfitted with oral histories from the city's storied immigrant population. Afghan-American artist Aman Mojadidi and Times Square Arts introduced the interactive art installation "Once Upon a Place," which allows participants to listen to the stories of immigrants who moved to New York through the receivers of old pay phones - once a common sight on city streets. Mojadidi came up with the idea when he heard that the phone booths were being removed. "I wanted to do sort of an urban project about migration, a storytelling project," he said. "For me the fact that these phone booths were being removed, I immediately thought about bringing them back and putting a different kind of story into them." The artist reworked three phone booths and collected stories from several immigrants who now call New York home. Their stories were recorded in English or in their native languages. Visitors can step into the booths and listen to the narrations on the phone. Marelisa Morejon, an immigrant from Cuba, decided to listen as she passed by the installation. "You can hear different histories, and it's very touching," she said. Visitors and New Yorkers will be able to hear the stories through September 5.

Inspector Morse creator Colin Dexter, who died on Tuesday, was a prolific creator of crosswords both real and fictional. Here are five clues that sum up his life of witty wordplay

Take in bachelor? It could do (3)

No sooner has DI Morse met Sgt Lewis for the first time than Morse thrusts a copy of the Times at Lewis and tells him to, “Have a look at 14 down.” Lewis, an occasional solver of the Mirror’s quick crossword, is “much puzzled”.

Morse, played by John Thaw in the TV adaptation, explains that it is the curious mixture of highbrow (R from the abbreviation for recipe, the Latin for “take”, inside BA, a bachelor’s degree) and lowbrow (the answer, BRA) that appeals to his cryptic mind. He asks: “Do you think I’m wasting your time, Lewis?”

Colin Dexter: a mischievous, generous man every bit as clever as his creations Read more

But of course, there’s a connection to the murder they’re about to work on; more importantly, Lewis’s reply (“Yes, sir”) reveals him to be the perfect sidekick.

It also proved, nine pages into his first novel, that the writer, Colin Dexter, was as deft with the misdirection and playfulness of cryptic cluing as he was with the same elements of the whodunnit.

Item gran arranged family slides in? (5,7)

This is Dexter’s clue for MAGIC LANTERN, the predecessor of the slide projector. In the wordplay, you “arrange” the letters of ITEM GRAN, then “slide in” another word for “family”: CLAN. The clue works simultaneously as a fair definition of the answer, and as a recipe for the answer’s letters. Such all-in-one clues are the acme of cryptic setting, and Dexter rightly won a prize.

The prize was for the monthly clue-writing competition for solvers of the Observer’s crossword, as much cerebral community as puzzle, which Dexter first entered 60 years ago. The winners are announced in a newsletter, which in 1976 noted “the disappearance from these lists for some time of NC (Colin) Dexter, for many years a redoubtable competitor”.

Dexter had taken time off crosswords to write the first two Morse novels, but had not forsaken them: in the first, Last Bus to Woodstock, every character except the murderer is named after a competition entrant, most notably Dexter’s arch-rivals: Lloyds chairman Sir Jeremy Morse and crossword setter Mrs B Lewis.

The real-life Morse, Dexter’s neighbour and “the cleverest man I ever met”, became a friend when Dexter was pruning a hedge in the 1960s. Morse introduced himself by saying: “I thought we’d better get acquainted.” And the fictional Morse took Dexter from famous-in-crosswords to famous full-stop.

Bradman’s famous duck (6)

Presently, Dexter began setting entire puzzles, as Codex for the Oxford Times, in a style that was tricky but playful and demanding of local knowledge. His wonderfully apt nom de guerre made him a full member of the club of Britain’s pseudonymous setters.

But he saved some of his best for Morse to solve. The clue above, which alludes to Don Bradman’s notorious dismissal at the Oval in 1948, is ingenious but very simple in its two definitions of DONALD: Bradman himself, and the celebrated cartoon waterfowl. In the novel, the clue is attributed to Quixote, a real-life setter known in this paper as Pasquale, who ruefully remarked: “Oh, that I had written it!”

In which are the Islets of Langerhans (8)

And Morse’s solving was no mere hobby. Our next clue, putatively from the Times, takes him two minutes to solve, making his time for the whole puzzle a frustrating 12 and a half minutes. But his pride’s loss is law and order’s gain.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Dexter on set, 1996. Photograph: Tim Ockenden/PA

Once Morse fathoms that the setter intends for him to waste time wondering whether those islets are in the Baltic or the South China Sea, when really they are in the PANCREAS, he grasps that the suspects in The Silent Death of Nicholas Quinn are likewise colluding to make him answer the wrong question: in this case, who was at the cinema for a blue movie, when in fact no one was.

The trouble with my method, Lewis, is it’s inspirational. And as a result, I sometimes – sometimes – get things arse-about-face.

The Morse novels are a celebration of thinking like a crossword solver: it’s a hobby that makes you more sceptical, more nimble, and – at least in the case of Morse – one that saves lives.



The hidden extra answer among the entries MOROCCO, LINEAGE, CEDED and EXTERIORS

Eagle-eyed Times solvers on 18 March 1993 might have noticed that as well as the answers JOHN and THAW, if you read from the end of one clue into the start of another, you could see the names of the composer and creator of the Morse TV series.

The steady-as-she-goes Times only really indulges in themes and hidden answers for events such as royal weddings, so this is was high praise indeed from the crosswording world.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Dexter in March 2017. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer

You can only hope that Dexter was kept in the dark and got to solve that one himself. He was a mean solver, too, and aimed to finish a puzzle in the time it took to eat his breakfast egg.

He gave up solving in 2009, when his eyesight was no longer up to it, but only this year called an end to 30 years of Hitchcock-like cameos in Morse, its sequel, Lewis, and its prequel, Endeavour.

He leaves us with those tales, the puzzles collected in book form as Chambers Morse Puzzles and the hundreds of commended clues in the archives of the Observer competition.

This replaces Monday’s post; the next post will appear on 3 April. Colin Dexter’s Desert Island Discs are available here.

These days the one thing you need to know to impress that wine buff you meet on Tinder or your wine snob of a brother-in-law is that orange wine is the latest thing.

So what exactly is orange wine? In a nutshell it's made using white wine grapes the red wine way. This means the grape skins are left on after they're crushed in what is saucily dubbed "skin contact".

Pronounced by a French sommelier, the words conjure images of forbidden relations between the vines. In practice, skin contact gives birth to a wine that often looks a lot like a dark yellow chardonnay but can produce the complexity and tannins of a red wine, while keeping the cool refreshing character of a chilled white.

Is orange wine new? As it happens, no. They've been making wine this way – particularly in Georgia – for millennia. But closer to home adventurous wine makers are attempting to revive its popularity and give wine lovers something fresh to enjoy on a sunny day.

The Week Portfolio tried five Italian orange wines on a warm summer evening at The Hive of Vyner Street in east London – here's what we thought:

2015 A. Maule 'Sassaia'

Grape: Garganega

This honey-coloured gem from Veneto has had three days of sensual skin contact and no intervention (no additives, temperature control, etc). The result is a friendly and approachable wine with a lot of promise.

2015 Baglio Bianco

Grape: Garganega

This drop from north-west Italy is nicely citrusy. We were advised that "the tannins make this wine stand up." Its sharper taste reminded us of a stinging barb from a witty aunt. Very quaffable.

2014 AA Zidarich

Grape: Vitovska

This cloudy-in-appearance north-eastern Italian wine is perhaps more strawberry blonde than ginger. Less complex than we expected, it lacks the fruitiness you'd expect from a garden variety white.

2014 Tenuta Grillo 'Sancho Panza'

Grape: Fiano

This gem from southern Campagna is a major step up in terms of tannins. It's floral and fruity with notes of honeysuckle and orange blossom, and would pair nicely with rich food.

2009 AA Denavolo 'Dinavolo'

Grape: Malvasia, Marsanne, Ortrugo

This is the darkest in colour by far, having had six months of skin contact. It's also strikingly different from the other wines we tried. The colour is reminiscent of a watery Aperol Spritz left in the sun. It has complex tannins – like a fine Bordeaux – with herby notes of thyme, and a dried apricot and candied orange flavour. This is a great wine that would definitely get tongues wagging at your next BBQ.

We were advised that orange wine is best served at 10 to 12 degrees Celsius (warmer than white, cooler than red). All wines are available at The Hive of Vyner Street, 286-290 Cambridge Heath Road (corner Vyner Street), London, E2 9DA

“She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said No!” is Donald Trump’s latest tweet targeting a female journalist. He was referring to “low IQ Crazy Mika” – that’s MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinsky, co-presenter of the Morning Joe programme, who had run a report critical of the US President.

Trump clearly plans no let-up in the feuds and sinister vendettas that have characterised his relationship with the US press. “The fake news media has never been so wrong or so dirty,” the President tweeted last week, accusing news organisations of “purposely incorrect stories and phony sources to meet their agenda of hate”.

Luckily for Mr Trump a number of high-profile UK journalists are on his side. So is Rupert Murdoch, an American citizen who owns Sky and newspapers The Times, The Sun and Sunday Times). According to Trump, Murdoch, who also owns Fox News in the US, is a “superb businessman and a world class CEO”.

Raheem Kassam, formerly Nigel Farage’s top adviser, delivers the Trump message as editor of Breitbart London. Breitbart employs James Delingpole of The Spectator, whose sceptical views on climate change make sense to Trump.

Foremost among Trump groupies, however, is Piers Morgan. The two men form a mutual congratulation society, and this is not surprising. Their fortunes are linked. Morgan went to the US to revive his career after being sacked as editor of the Daily Mirror for publishing crudely faked photographs of British soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners.

His major breakthrough came when he became the first winner of Trump’s Celebrity Apprentice. This was the show which rescued Donald Trump after he flirted with financial catastrophe in the 1990s.

After his Apprentice triumph, Morgan replaced Trump’s friend Larry King as presenter of CNN’s flagship current affairs show. “It was great to appear on Piers Morgan Tonight last night as his first live guest,” tweeted Trump in February 2011.

Three year’s later, when Morgan was dumped by CNN, Trump congratulated him again, this time “on his new position as Editor-at-Large for the United States” for MailOnline.

In our study of Trump’s social media output we discovered that Trump has mentioned or retweeted Morgan on Twitter almost 100 times, always approvingly. The issues are not always trivial. Trump used Morgan to alert his 20 million Twitter followers about the decisive FBI intervention in the presidential campaign at the end of October last year. He retweeted “@piersmorgan BOMBSHELL: FBI reopening its investigation into HillaryClinton’s email server after new discovery!”

In return Morgan always boosts Trump, especially when in trouble. When Trump’s plan “for a complete and total shutdown of Muslims entering the United States” was greeted with outrage in December 2015, Morgan tweeted: “Have any of the 200k plus British citizens who’ve signed the petition to ban Trump signed any petition to ban UK terror suspects returning from Iraq/Syria.”

A grateful Trump tweeted back: “Thank you Piers, they don’t know what they’re getting into.”

When Trump was under fire in 2012 for promoting the “birther” conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not born in the US, Morgan helpfully told the Hollywood Reporter that Trump was the “personification of brash, successful America Incorporated”.

Under fire Trump retweeted the interview: “Thank you to @Piers Morgan for your nice statement about me”.

Morgan was a regular cheerleader for Trump during the presidential campaign. “Trump’s a fantastic debater. Don’t know why others even bother taking him on. Like goading a 3-ton bull.”

Back came Trump, regular as clockwork: “Thanks. @Piers Morgan, You’re great.” To be fair to Morgan, he was one of the very few journalists who completely grasped that mesmeric campaigning appeal of Donald Trump, especially when compared to his robotic opponent Hilary Clinton.

Trump's most controversial tweets

Nowadays Morgan goes on Fox News to stand up for the President. In February, with Trump’s presidency under sustained fire, Morgan – who is British – laid into CNN as “Un-American”.

Not being American himself, it’s hard to say exactly why Morgan felt qualified to make this statement, but there we are.

The relation repeats Morgan’s connection with Tony Blair, with whom (as he boasted in his diaries) he enjoyed “22 lunches, six dinners, six interviews, 24 further one-to-one chats over tea and biscuits, and numerous phone calls.”

From Blair to Trump is quite a journey. Trump follows just 45 Twitter accounts, and Morgan’s is one of them.

This means that when the US President switches on his Twitter feed he is sometimes subjected to Morgan’s rants against Arsene Wenger, the courteous and impeccably liberal manager of Arsenal (and outspoken early supporter of centrist French President Emmanuel Macron, the polar opposite of Trump).

Another Trump bastion in the British press is Katie Hopkins, like Morgan a MailOnline columnist. Hopkins has Trump’s The Apprentice to thank for her career too – she took part as a contestant in the British version in 2007 and has never looked back.

Hopkins is seen as a bigot by many British journalists, but not by Trump who tweeted this in December 2015: “Thank you to respected columnist Katie Hopkins of DailyMail.com for her powerful writing on the UK’s Muslim problems.”

He linked to an article headlined: “Don’t demonise Trump, he speaks for millions of Americans. And who can blame them for not wanting to end up like us.”

Trump urged British politicians to watch Hopkins on Fox News: “Many people in the UK agree with me.” For her part, Hopkins tweeted: “If Donald Trump wins the race to the White House I’m moving to America. Daring to bare what some people really think.”

Unfortunately for Britain, despite Trump’s victory, Katie Hopkins has yet to head across the pond.

Journalists like Morgan and (more especially) Hopkins have become part of an echo chamber which reaffirms Trump’s outlook. Immediately after the terror atrocity at Westminster Hopkins went on Fox News to report from London that “people are cowed, people are afraid. People are not united.”

In fact Londoners were neither cowed nor afraid, and we were indeed united in horror (under the leadership of Sadiq Khan, a Muslim mayor) at the attack.

We quietly got on with our lives. This Fox News/Hopkins portrait of a capital city paralysed by terror was nonsense, but fits in with the Trumpian worldview of a western world engulfed by a clash of civilisations.

Following the Manchester concert bombing, Hopkins tweeted “We need a final solution”. The public outrage at her use of terminology associated with the Holocaust forced Hopkins to show rare contrition. But following the attack on London Bridge and Borough Market, she directed her fire at the city’s mayor, even while he was coordinating the response of the emergency services and authorities: “No, @SadiqKhan. We do not want to hear a single word from you. Not one word. London Bridge has fallen down on your watch, son # LondonBridge”

Trump piled in with a parallel attack on Khan: “At least seven dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ‘no reason to be alarmed!’” After the mayor’s spokesman detailed how the statement had “deliberately” been taken out of context, Trump piled in harder: “Pathetic excuse by London mayor Sadiq Khan, who had to think fast on his ‘no reason to be alarmed’” statement. MSM [mainstream media] is working hard to sell it!”

Trump takes little notice of other voices in the British media, with the notable exception of the BBC, against which he has long held an especially bitter grudge. On Twitter he’s accused the BBC of “bias and stupidity”, “shoddy journalism” and producing “garbage”. When he gave his first press conference at the White House on in February, he dismissed BBC correspondent Jon Sopel with the phrase, “Here’s another beauty.”

As far as we can tell, Trump’s hostility to the national broadcaster has very little to do with the BBC’s allegedly liberal opinions. It is all about 2011 documentary You’ve Been Trumped by the fearless Anthony Baxter, exposing how Trump’s Scottish golf business bullied local residents.

For weeks Trump trolled the filmmaker, hurling tweet after tweet of abuse. The following is just a sample:

“Your documentary died many deaths. You have, in my opinion, zero talent.”

“Thanks for helping promote & make Trump International Golf Links Scotland so successful – you stupid fool!”

“Apprentice is a huge hit all over the world. Your cheap & boring documentary is a tremendous flop.”

“Your documentary works better than any sleeping pill – in fact that may be your only way to make money with this recycled garbage!”

“Heard your documentary cost you less than $3,000 to make – where did you get that kind of money?”

When Baxter produced a follow-up documentary, Trump followed-up with another assault via Twitter. It ended with the future President asserting: “Every time I speak of the haters and losers I do so with great love and affection. They cannot help the fact that they were born f***** up!”

Our study of Trump’s Tweets opened our eyes to a deranged universe of racists and conspiracy theorists. Trump entertains notions that the Clintons murdered their opponents, that Barack Obama was born in Kenya, that climate change is a fabrication got up by the Chinese to destroy the American manufacturing industry, and that the US is under existential threat from what he calls “radical Islam”.

Before he entered the White House, he even retweeted one account under the macabre Twitter handle “White Genocide”, whose author turned out on inspection to be a sophisticated apologist for Hitler.

This is dark stuff and Mr Trump’s British apologists need to take great care. Katie Hopkins looks a lost cause but Piers Morgan has (probably at personal cost) maintained an element of independence, for example by demanding stronger gun laws in the US.

He is the only Briton with daily access to the President through his Twitter account. Perhaps he can use this access to become a force for good.

I was sceptical about Manchester’s new hire bikes, fearing they would all end up at the bottom of the Ship Canal.

Yet just a week after Chinese firm Mobike plonked 1,000 silver and orange two-wheelers on the streets of Manchester and Salford, I’m already a convert. Yes, there have been a few glitches with the app (you’re supposed to be able to reserve a bike for 15 minutes but I haven’t been able to for a few days), and I’ve no idea what those messages say that they’ve sent me in Chinese. But Mobikes are significantly better than London’s hire bikes, or any I’ve tried in other cities across the world. Here’s why:

1 You can leave them anywhere

There are no docking stations, so you can just park your Mobike at your destination, whether that’s outside your house, the pub, the cinema, the station. The other day I merrily left one in the Northern Quarter, a part of the city I have avoided by bike since mine got stolen there earlier in the year. In London I’ve had many infuriating experiences — notably, cycling to Euston on a Boris Bike to catch a train, only to discover the nearest docking station (which is still five minutes walk away from the platforms) is full. Not a problem with Mobikes. You can leave them anywhere within the boundaries of Manchester and Salford, as long as you park them somewhere public that doesn’t obstruct the road or pavement.

2 They’re cheap

At 50p per half hour, the pricing is low enough that you feel it’s worth a quick spin, even just a five-minute ride that would have taken 20 to walk. In London, it costs £2 for a day pass, which allows unlimited rides of 30 minutes or less. But often when I’m down in the capital I just want to do one quick ride, and £2 feels a bit much, when it’s only £1.50 to take the bus. It’s significantly more expensive in other cities: a 24-hour pass for a B-bike in Austin, Texas, costs $12 (£9.30). A Vélib in Paris is €1.70 (£1.50).

3 They’re fun to ride

Yes, the single gear is pretty low, so you’ll be pedalling like billy-o if you’re in a rush. And the airless tyres do make for a slightly bone-shaking ride, especially on cobbles. But they’re much nippier than the London tanks, and lighter too. The jury is out on whether they really are indestructible, as the designers claim. There are doubtless some Manc reprobates who will do their best to prove the Chinese wrong.

4 The system rewards good behaviour

It remains to be seen whether the fleet will all get trashed or nicked, but built into Mobike’s operation is a points system which rewards chivalry and punishes selfishness and anti social behaviour. All users start with 100 credits. If you end up on zero you are barred from using the bikes. Being a tell-tale pays. If you dob someone in for parking “wrongly” (ie in the middle of the road or in their front garden, like this one I spotted in Old Trafford), you get an extra credit. You lose 20 credits if you park it somewhere inaccessible to the public, 15 if you forget to lock it, 100 if you abandon one after being stopped by the police. Attach your own personal lock or break the law on one and you’ll be on a big fat zero. In future, you may be able to earn free rides if you spot a bike parked somewhere silly and ride it back into the centre of town.

Helen Pidd (@helenpidd) Naughty naughty - don't think @MobikeUK bikes are supposed to be parked in front gardens. Wondered why this one hadn't moved in days pic.twitter.com/Bjn25C8Ctb

5 They aren’t a massive drain on public funds

Don’t get me wrong, I am all for diverting a lot more of the transport budget towards cycling. But the London scheme has cost £60m of public money since it launched in 2010, and is still subsidised to the tune of £3.6m each year. Mobike costs Manchester and Salford city councils diddly squat. They hope the bikes will save them money, because Mobike has promised to share with them data showing where the bikes are most commonly ridden, which should help them plan future cycle infrastructure. On which note: please sort out the canal and Irwell-side routes, Transport for Greater Manchester. Last night I really struggled to lug a Mobike up the steps to Regent Road when the riverside bike route suddenly stopped.

Of course, they are not perfect. If Mobike are reading this please consider:

CHRIS FROOME OF TEAM SKY CHATTING WITH RICHIE PORTE OF BMC RACING ON STAGE TWO, FROOME WEARS A STYLE OF JERSEY FOR GENERAL STAGES STORY: Tension was building up around Team Sky after two days on the Tour de France as rival teams complained that the jerseys they used for the opening time trial had been designed to illegally boost aerodynamics. The British team put four riders in the top eight of Saturday's opening time trial, with Geraint Thomas taking the race leader's yellow jersey. Little bubble pads were seen on the upper arms on the jerseys of several Team Sky riders, including that of defending champion Chris Froome. International Cycling Union (UCI) regulations state: "Garments must not be adapted in any way such that they diverge from their use purely as clothing. The addition of any non-essential element or device to clothing is prohibited." "It is an actual part of the jersey, it was not added," race jury president Philippe Marien told Reuters on Sunday (July 2). "We summoned the team's sports directors to check the jerseys. Nothing was added to them," said Marien. Some teams, however, were not happy with the jury's view. Reuters learnt that at least two rival teams had complained about the Team Sky jerseys ahead of Sunday's 203.5-km ride to Liege. "It's enhanced aerodynamics and the regulations forbid it," said Frederic Grappe, performance director at the FDJ team. "According to studies, the estimated gain is about four to seven percent. It's huge." Italian Marco Pinotti, a coach at BMC Racing, told Reuters: "It seems to me this 'equipment' is on the border line with the rules but if it's judged compliant with the rules then I accept it." Asked by a reporter if he had used the jersey before Saturday Thomas said: "I used it at the Giro (in May)." While some believe Team Sky are bending the rules, their sports director Nicolas Portal said they were 'working' them. "There are other teams who have been using it. Other big teams have been using it," the Frenchman said. "It's legal. Everybody knows the rules. It does not give you a big advantage but it's those little things... so why not use them? "Everything has been validated. We would not take the risk to cheat and lose everything on the first day. We abide by the rules. Every team needs to work on the rules."

Heather Watson is within touching distance of achieving her long-term goal of reaching the second week of a grand slam - which could be bad news for coach Morgan Phillips.

Watson produced one of her best performances at Wimbledon with a 6-0 6-4 win over 18th seed Anastasija Sevastova to make the third round for the third time.

She has never gone further either here or at any other slam - also making the last 32 at Wimbledon in 2012 and 2015 and at the Australian Open in 2013.

Should she beat former world number one Victoria Azarenka on Friday, Phillips will have to honour an uncomfortable promise.

Watson said: "It's been one of my goals forever. I made those big goals years ago. Making second week of a slam would be huge for me.

"And if I do, my coach said he'd shave his head. But I said, 'No, your girlfriend will kill you. You can shave your legs."'

It has been a difficult 12 months for Watson, who struggled after losing a close match in the first round at Wimbledon last year and had been unable to find any momentum.

She dropped out of the top 100 and failed to qualify for the French Open but things finally came together again in Eastbourne last week, where she reached the semi-finals.

Watson has spent much of the last year without a regular coach and credits Phillips and Colin Beecher, who she began working with at the start of the clay season, for helping her turn things around.

She said: "I'm happy with them. Practices are going really well. I feel like I have structure. I'm enjoying it, which is the most important part.

"But it makes me want to work hard, as well. I feel like my tennis is just really improving at the moment."

Wimbledon Day Three: Murray makes it four Brits into the third round

Watson is no stranger to ups and downs having broken into the top 50 in 2012 only to tumble back into triple figures after struggling with glandular fever.

She then rose to a career-high mark of 38 in January 2015 before slipping down again.

While Watson stopped short of empathising too much with Bernard Tomic after his claim that he was bored during his first-round match, she has experienced her own struggles with motivation.

The 25-year-old said: "I'm not motivated every week. I think that's normal. It's very hard to be.

"But you have to find that motivation in the weeks where it's harder, where you're in a random country, all the way on the back courts, nobody's watching. It's tougher. It's very different. It's easy to be motivated here for me.

"It's just like telling somebody to be happy every single week. That's not life. There's highs and lows to everything you do. For me the highs are really high."

Watson is hoping to book her place in the third round (EPA)



Currently ranked 102, Watson will climb back into double figures after a superb performance against the fast-rising Sevastova, who won the warm-up tournament in Majorca.

She did not put a foot wrong in a first set that lasted only 19 minutes, not making a single unforced error.

Sevastova looked out of ideas, with Watson giving short shrift to her favoured drop shots, but the British player's level dropped a little at the start of the second.

Watson trailed by a break at 3-1 and then 4-3 but a break to love of the Sevastova serve in the eighth game proved the crucial blow to the Latvian's resolve.

"Starts are very important, but I'm really happy with the second set because she raised her level," said Watson.

"The first set I just felt great, pretty flawless. It's always going to change. I've got to expect her to raise her level and to try something new, and she did.

"I was pleased with how I remained calm and just kept doing what I was doing."

Now Watson must try to win her first match in five attempts against Azarenka, who claimed the best win of her comeback so far 6-3 6-3 against Elena Vesnina.

Johanna Konta won an exhausting marathon on Centre Court on Wednesday afternoon to reach the third round of Wimbledon for the first time in her career. Konta and Croatian youngster Donna Vekic played for more than three hours in the draining sun. Konta took the first set, Vekic the second before the home favourite eventually edged over the line 10-8 in the third.

It was a thrilling back-and-forth match, in which each of the three sets could have gone the other way. Konta said afterwards that both players deserved to win, which was indisputably true. It was a long slog in the lunch-time heat, through a swarm of flying ants, many of which the players inadvertently swallowed. And it was surely the best match of the ladies’ singles here so far.

Konta said it was “one of the most epic matches I have been a part of”, and there will not be many better here this month. “It was one of those matches where it was going to be decided at the very last minute. I feel very fortunate to have come through that, it was a great battle to be part of.”

From the start of the first set, just after 1pm, the pace was relentless and it hardly let up until it ended just before 4.20pm. The crucial break in the decisive set came in the 18th game, as Konta found extra energy from somewhere to take her away from Vekic. The Croat saved the first match point with an ace but at the second she could only find the net. Konta celebrated with glee and relief, and a real sense that she can go far.

Vekic left the court in tears and Konta felt for her young opponent. “After such a battle, you feel both your own and her emotions, because there wasn’t much separating us” Konta said. “I could easily put myself in her shoes and feel what she was feeling. I congratulated her for the battle we put on.”

As Konta admitted, it all could have gone very different. Especially had she not dug in to turn around the first set hours before. It was the lively Vekic who broke her first to go 5-3 up, then forcing her way to two set points. Konta furiously saved them and broke back, to the roar of the Centre Court crowd.

Konta nearly edged ahead at 5-5 but missed four break points and the first set ended up in a tie break. At the end of a set of missed chances and swinging momentum, the tie break was much the same, but Konta pushed ahead and won it 7-4.

The crowd got emphatically behind Konta and stayed with her all afternoon. “I absolutely love playing in front of Brit crowds,” Konta said, “it does make it that much more when you have home support. They lived and died with the match as well.”

After 67 minutes of draining tennis, the second set was even more topsy-turvy. It began with three breaks in the first five games, and there was almost a fourth, but Vekic held. From there the Croatian started to pull away and when she had the chance to serve for the set, she just about held her nerve.

Vekic pushed the Briton all the way ( Getty )

By this point Konta and Vekic were tiring and the third set could never have been as fast as the first two were. The match started to go predictably with serve and the upsets of the second set felt far away. There were barely any moments where a break felt likely, although one miscued Konta smash in the sixth game could have opened an opportunity up.

It was in the 13th game of the epic final set when we saw the first break point, which Vekic worked so hard for, but even then Konta dug in, found some power from somewhere and got through. Four games, another anxious moment, another Vekic break point, but Konta saved again to go 9-8 up. The next game was when the break finally came, sending Konta through.

The controversy over players pulling out of first-round matches at Wimbledon due to injury has deepened after Spain’s Feliciano López competed in a doubles match 24 hours after withdrawing from his singles contest.

López, the 19th seed, cited a foot injury after retiring against France’s Adrian Mannarino. He was one of seven men to withdraw on Tuesday but was back on court yesterday alongside unrelated doubles partner Marc López. Feliciano did receive treatment yesterday as the 11th-seeded Spaniards lost 3-6, 7-6, 6-2, 6-4 against Australia’s Matt Reid and John-Patrick Smith. He refused to give any post-match interviews.

Britain’s Heather Watson said she believed that some players with injuries were turning up just to access the £35,000 paid to first-round losers.

She said: “It sucks if…

US president says he is determined to confront threat from Pyongyang, after his ambassador to UN raises prospect of military action if diplomacy fails

Donald Trump has said he is considering some “very severe things” in response to North Korea’s successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) this week, as he called on other nations to exert pressure on Pyongyang over its “very bad behaviour”.

The president’s comments, made in Poland, came after the US ambassador to the UN made a push for new sanctions at a security council meeting and said America’s “considerable military forces” could be used against North Korea.



Nikki Haley told the meeting the US would submit a draft resolution within days “that raises the international response in a way that is proportionate to North Korea’s escalation”, but warned Washington had options if diplomacy failed.

“The United States is prepared to use the full range of our capabilities to defend ourselves and our allies,” Haley said. “One of our capabilities lies with our considerable military forces. We will use them, if we must, but we prefer not to have to go in that direction.”

She said the US was eyeing penalties against “any country that does business with this outlaw regime”.



Trump said the US would confront the North Korean threat, but noted that he would not draw a red line. “I don’t like to talk about what I have planned, but I have some pretty severe things that we’re thinking about,” he said. “That doesn’t mean we’re going to do them.”

Some administration officials are still hoping to persuade China to increase economic pressure on Pyongyang.

Trump is scheduled to meet the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg, where he will travel from Poland later on Thursday.



Trump and Vladimir Putin are also expected to address growing North Korean provocations at their meeting on Friday.

Haley did not go into detail about the proposed resolution but said that if the council was united, the international community could cut off major sources of hard currency to North Korea, restrict oil to its military and weapons programs, increase air and maritime restrictions, and hold senior officials accountable.



China has already called for restraint from all sides, after joining diplomatic forces with Russia to suggest that North Korea suspend its missile programme in return for a moratorium on large-scale US and South Korean military exercises.

Donald Trump's romance with China's Xi has cooled, 'ass-kicking' could lie ahead Read more

China is pushing for talks between world powers and North Korea on dismantling its nuclear programme but the US maintains that Pyongyang must first halt its missile and nuclear tests.



China’s UN ambassador, Liu Jieyi, said North Korea’s missile test was a “flagrant violation” of UN resolutions, but aimed his missive at both sides of the conflict.



“We call on all the parties concerned to exercise restraint, avoid provocative actions, and belligerent rhetoric, demonstrate the will for unconditional dialogue and work actively together to defuse the tension,” Jieyi said.



That would cover deployments like the live-fire ballistic missile exercise early on Wednesday that officials in Seoul said was intended as a warning to Pyongyang.

The Pentagon said on Wednesday that the missile test-fired by North Korea was not one the US had previously seen, and was fired from a new launch point.



Jeff Davis, the Pentagon spokesman, told reporters that as no airspace had been cleared for the test, commercial planes and ships in the surrounding area had been exposed to risk. He said: “This act demonstrates that North Korea poses a threat to the United States and our allies and we remain prepared to defend ourselves and our allies and to use the full range of capabilities at our disposal.”



Kim delivered his own message on Wednesday, with the state Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) quoting him as saying: “American bastards would be not very happy with this gift sent on the July 4 anniversary.”



The news agency claimed the North Korean missile was capable of carrying a “large, heavy nuclear warhead” that could survive re-entry into the earth’s atmosphere.

Kim was quoted as saying the North’s long confrontation with Washington had entered the “final stage” and that Pyongyang would not put its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles up for negotiation “unless the US hostile policy and nuclear threats come to an end completely”.

A report in its state media said Kim urged his scientists to “frequently send big and small ‘gift packages’ to the Yankees”.

Questions remain about whether the North can miniaturize a nuclear weapon to fit a missile nosecone, or if it has mastered the technology needed for it to survive re-entry into the earth’s atmosphere.



Some experts believe the North already has the ability to mount warheads on shorter-range missiles that can strike South Korea and Japan, home to dozens of US military bases and about 80,000 US troops.

Mark Hoban, the former City minister, is optimistic about a post-Brexit deal with the EU Rex Features

Britain could add £43 billion to its economy by 2025 despite Brexit by developing its regions and focusing on new technology.

That is the conclusion of a report on the future of financial services by PWC and TheCityUK that argues that Brexit poses a challenge but is also an opportunity for wide-scale change.

To achieve it, the government must do more to co-ordinate departments and collaborate with industry. Banks, insurers and asset managers must “focus on rebuilding trust, embedding more ethical and customer-centric behaviours”, the report said. London would remain the main centre but other areas would also benefit.

Three quarters of the incremental benefit would be outside the capital, with areas such as Birmingham attracting more business and building on decisions by HSBC and…

Alec Baldwin's latest film Blind, in which he plays a visually-impaired writer, has received criticism for not casting a disabled actor in his role.

The Ruderman Family Foundation, an American philanthropic organisation that fights for the inclusion of disabled people, compared the casting to so-called blackface, where white actors are cast to play black characters.

Foundation president Jay Ruderman said on Wednesday: “Alec Baldwin in Blind is just the latest example of treating disability as a costume.

“We no longer find it acceptable for white actors to portray black characters. Disability as a costume needs to also become universally unacceptable.”

Baldwin, 59, who has been garnering worldwide attention for his impressions of US President Donald Trump, plays a novelist who lost his sight in a car crash that killed his wife.

The film, which will be released in the US on July 14, also stars Demi Moore as a woman who must care for Baldwin's character as part of a plea bargain deal for her husband.

Ruderman released a report last year that laid bare the disparity between the proportion of disabled people in the public and that of those in acting.

What do antique renovation and deep sea diving have in common? More than you might think, says Guy Chenevix-Trench, owner of Antiques by Design, which takes cricket bats and balls, World War II gas masks and musical instruments and turns them into collectible lamps.

Mr Chenevix-Trench, 61, began as a North Sea diver at the age of 19, welding pipelines up to 600ft under the sea. “Four of you live in the tiniest of decompression chambers, working 12 to 15 hours a day. When you’re at the bottom of the North Sea, you don’t necessarily have everything you want; you’ve got to cobble stuff together. So I’ve always been quite a good cobbler, getting things together and making something of it.”

When Roger Federer passed the 10,000 career aces milestone in his first-round match at Wimbledon, it reinforced his reputation as one of the finest servers of all time.

But who is the greatest of them all in the men's game? Well, it depends on which stats you look at.

Federer joined an exclusive club during his match on Tuesday. He became just the third man to hit the 10,000 mark since 1991, when the ATP World Tour began tracking the metric, after Ivo Karlovic (12,062 aces to date) and Goran Ivanisevic (10,131) who has now retired.

"It's surreal," 18-times grand slam winner Federer told ESPN. "It puts me up there with the likes of Ivanisevic and Karlovic, to whom I look up to and think they have the most unbelievable serve."

But a glance at another statistic - aces per match - sees the Swiss maestro drop down the servers' leaderboard.

His 10,004 aces have come in 1,294 matches, giving him an average of 7.7 per match. This not only puts him behind Croatian pair Karlovic (19.4) and Ivanisevic (13.9), but also a number of other players including Americans John Isner (17.4), Andy Roddick (11.7) and Pete Sampras (11).

And then there's the percentage of service games won - arguably a more telling statistic - where Federer boasts a mighty 89 percent but nonetheless trails Karlovic (92), Isner (91), Canada's Milos Raonic (91) and Roddick (90), according to ATP data.

Wimbledon : All the winners since Federer's first title

In terms of naked speed, meanwhile, no one can compete with Australian Sam Groth who fired a 163.7 mph (263.4 kph) bazooka across the net in 2012 - the fastest serve ever recorded.

Putting all the stats together, 6ft 11in tall Karlovic emerges as arguably the strongest contender. He tops the lists for number of aces, aces per match and percentage of service games won.

He has also hammered down the fourth-fastest serve on record - 156 mph - and the quickest second serve at 144 mph.

But of course, such numbers fail to take into account qualities that pundits say are the stuff of champions, like producing the best serves on big points - Federer, Sampras, Boris Becker - and ice-cool control under pressure.

So, who's the greatest server of all time? Even armed with all the stats in the world, it's a matter of opinion.

​Climbing temples in the ancient Burmese city of Bagan will soon be phased out according to the country’s Ministry of Culture.

Tourists often head to the top of the famed pagodas at sunrise and sunset in order to snap the coveted shot of countless hot air balloons rising above the city.

But with Bagan lobbying to become a Unesco World Heritage Site by 2019, authorities have said the practice is damaging to buildings and should be prohibited.

“They are very old monuments, and some could collapse at any time,” says Thein Lwin, Deputy Director General of the Ministry’s Department of Archaeology. “Banning climbing is a necessary precaution to protect our cultural heritage.”

Thein Lwin says that sunrise and sunset viewing will soon be available from a tethered helium balloon. The government is also planning to create more “lookout spots”, man-made hills in the archaeological area from which tourists can still enjoy the view without risking the pagodas.

Burma’s government tried to ban climbing in February 2016 before swiftly reversing the move following fierce backlash from local tour operators. However, since an earthquake in August 2016 damaged more than 400 of Bagan’s buildings, the Ministry has banned climbing at a handful of popular temples, including Thagyarhit, Thagyarbone, Pyathada and Thitsarwady. There is no date set for a complete ban on climbing all other temples, including Shwesandaw, the most famous sunset-viewing temple. However, it can’t be long – Aung San Suu Kyi, the nation’s de facto leader, said in January that sunset viewing from the pagodas “will have a negative impact on the long-term sustainability.”

Other improvements are in the works to help Bagan secure Unesco status. These include beefing up security, improving access roads, and removing all billboards that block views of pagodas. Following a ban on new developments in the archaeological zone in 2014, a new hotel strip is springing up near Bagan’s airport.

Want to visit Baku? You're in luck. Travelling to Azerbaijan used to mean a convoluted and inconvenient visa process that turned off travellers and stifled tourism. But in January of this year the new “ASAN e-visa” system came online, allowing citizens of 81 countries, including the UK, Australia, and US, to quickly apply and receive the visa via email. Visitors who take advantage will find plenty of things to see: a cosmopolitan, affordable capital of good eats, incredible architecture – and, most importantly, friendly cats.

Here are the top 10 things to do in Baku:

Stroll the seafront

Baku sits in a natural bay on a peninsula jutting out into the Caspian Sea. The city is oriented towards the water and the breeze coming off of it, and the best stretch of waterfront is reserved for recreation and entertainment. Milli Park and its wide pedestrian promenade, named Dənizkənarı Bulvar, trace the curve of the bay and provide plenty of sunshine and space for jogging, cycling, dog-walking, and rollerblading (yes, rollerblading still a thing here). Along the route are sights like the “Baku Eye” ferris wheel, Park Bulvar mall, and the under-construction Caspian Waterfront building with its petal-like points inspired by the “sails” of the Sydney Opera House. Walk to the end to finish at National Flag Square (Dövlət Bayrağı Meydanı) with a flag and flagpole that rank among the world’s largest. Its neighbour, the massive Crystal Hall, was built for Eurovision 2012.

Eat like a king

Since 2015, Azerbaijan’s currency has halved in value against the pound. As a result, Baku is a terrifically budget-friendly city where even backpackers can afford to eat like royalty. Reserve a table within the stone arched dining room of Şirvanşah, which is as much a museum as it is a restaurant. The cocktail list may be long, but we love the fresh pomegranate juice and simple feijoa compote, the latter a sweet juice made with feijoa fruit most typically associated with Brazil. Save room to finish with a tea service and a plate of national sweets, such as the hazelnut-filled shekerbura pastry, while local musicians play traditional Azeri music. For a feast for two, you’ll find it difficult to spend even 85 manat (£40) total.

( Baku's far more beautiful than you might have realised Fairmont Baku )

Ride the funicular to the Flame Towers

50 qəpik (23p) is all it costs for a ride up the Baku funicular from the seaside to the three strikingly modern buildings known as the Flame Towers. One contains offices, another residences, and the third is the Fairmont Hotel Baku, though none offer an observation deck. Selfies are still compulsory up here: the funicular conveniently lets you off at Dağüstü Park, the landscaped terraces of which overlook the Bay of Baku and give the best view over the city. Time it right to catch the beginning of sunset from the foot of the Flame Towers, then take the stairs down through the park back to the seaside to the plaza next to the Azerbaijan Carpet Museum: the best spot to view the night-time light decorations of the Flame Towers (which, naturally, feature faux flames).

Drink tea

Bypass the souvenir hawkers of the Old City and descend down stone stairs to a hidden teahouse and shisha den around the corner from the Shah Palace Hotel. Low seating, Azeri wool carpets, tasselled silk curtains, and carved wood screens section off the Old Baku Tea House into semi-private nooks ideal for lounging and playing backgammon. There’s no menu, but your best bet is the “national tea set” of a pot of the house chai, delicately poured into pear-shaped glasses of cut crystal. It comes complete with fresh lemon slices, cubed sugar, a variety of nuts and dried fruits and a plate of fresh pakhlava, Azerbaijan’s version of baklava.

Have a kebab

On a nice night thousands of locals finish their day with a walk through Baku’s pedestrian zone flanked by embassies, corporate headquarters, and palatial residences in architectural styles that range from neo-Moorish to baroque. Nizami Street (Nizami Küçəsi) is nicknamed “shopping street” for all the high street shops that line it, which stay open late hoping to lure in casual browsers, but it’s also a destination for late-night snacking. Skip the “tornado potato” sticks and stop into any of the many, many döner shops for an Azeri-style kebab. Point to the paper-thin flatbread called “lavash” and pick your meat. Skewers, or “shashliks”, can be lamb, beef, chicken, fish, or veggies, but always include onions and special spices before being wrapped in the bread.

Make sure you get a real Azerbaijani carpet (Cynthia Drescher )

Haggle for a carpet

As an ancient centre of carpet weaving, you can be sure Baku has rugs to sell you. Skip the hawkers of the Old City for the shop within the Carpet Museum , where the staff can fully articulate the origin, history, and significance of the materials and design of each carpet. Prices for large rugs begin at 1000 AZN (£460), but haggling is encouraged, especially if you have your eyes on more than one. The carpet museum stocks rugs of both wool and silk with cotton, and only those handmade within Azerbaijan using traditional methods and themes. Bargaining with hawkers in the Old City may mean purchasing a cheaper rug made in Pakistan, but passed off as Azeri, and then still having to wait a day or two for the export certificate so you can take your souvenir home. The museum is able to issue the certificate on the same day.

Sightsee by subway

Public transportation may not seem like an activity you want to experience on holiday, but Baku’s tidy metro and web of underground pedestrian passages (most with escalators) make it supremely easy to pack lots of sights into one day, even if they’re across town. The underground stations themselves even showcase dramatic design, such as with the Old City’s glass pyramid and carpet-print entrance and the fluted columns of the platform at Ganjlik Mall, the largest mall in Azerbaijan. Best of all, transport is cheap – a four-ride “BakıKart” costs 1 manat (£0.46).

See Zaha Hadid’s architecture

This is the setting for your next Facebook profile photo. The Heydar Aliyev Centre (Heydər Əliyev Mərkəzi) is Azerbaijan taking a hard stance against the brutalist Soviet architecture of its past for a future of beauty and technology. It’s a masterwork of Zaha Hadid’s firm and stunning from every angle, inside and out. And you must go inside. Entry is 15 manat (£6.90) and for the fee you’ll be able to access an exhibition on Heydar Aliyev, a floor of detailed scale models of Azerbaijan’s most important architectural works, and a small museum showcasing Azerbaijani crafts, customs, and culture. Finish your visit by prancing through its gardens of modern art sculptures, flower fields, and waterfalls while taking another few hundred photos of the building.

Eat Azeri cuisine

At Sehrli Təndir restaurant in the Old City, the menu is a list of everything you shouldn’t leave Azerbaijan without tasting. Definitely do the dolma (aubergine, linden leaves, grape leaves, or peppers stuffed with meat, onion, rice, herbs, and mint, then topped with a dollop of cool yogurt), plov (buttery rice pilaf with meat, chestnut, and cooked fruit), and the ubiquitous kebabs. The star of the show here, however, is the open tandoor oven at the entrance, where the restaurant’s resident baker tends to the breads cooking inside.

Cat-spot in the Old City

UNESCO designated Baku’s ancient Old City (İçərişəhər) as a World Heritage Site in 2000, but its roots as a social centre reach back to at least the 12th century. Within its walls sit enough sights to fill an entire day including Maiden Tower, Juma Mosque, Hamam Mehellesi public baths, and Palace of the Shirvanshahs. But its most photogenic residents are the community cats, who laze about on balconies and stone stoops when they aren’t mousing. There aren’t as many strays in Baku as in Istanbul, so their presence isn’t overwhelming but complementary to the winding streets and windowsills of historic homes. Show the kitties any attention and, more than likely, they’ll rouse themselves from their reverie for a good head scratch.

Experience the Lake District in all its glory this summer with a chic Scandi-style hotel as your base. Overnight stays at the Inn on the Square in Keswick are now £169, up to 28% less than normal, and include:

Accommodation in a Herdwick or Town Room, with full Cumbrian breakfast, for two

A £28-per-person allowance to spend on dinner in the AA-Rosette Brossen Steakhouse

A glass of prosecco each on arrival (worth £5 per person)

Inn on the Square is a chic hotel in Keswick's Market Square. This Georgian property has a Scandinavian flavour -- think mid-century modern furniture and wintery colour schemes.

Keswick is a pretty market town, "encircled by cloud-capped fells" (Lonely Planet), in the northern Lake District. The hotel is a 10-minute walk from Derwentwater, a 3-mile-long lake surrounded by wooded fells, so you can go on an 8-mile hike around its shores or take a cruise from Keswick Pier. It also makes a good base from which to explore Borrowdale valley or climb Skiddaw, a 931-metre mountain to the north.

The Back Bar is a cosy family-friendly spot. It has a log-burning stove, exposed stone walls and live sports on the TV. The pub menu includes homemade scotch eggs and burgers. The Front Bar is a smarter, lounge-style space. For AA-Rosette-awarded dining, there's the Brossen Steakhouse restaurant, which specialises in dry-aged steaks served with sides like roasted bone marrow, beef-dripping chips or truffled mac and cheese.

The hotel's 34 rooms have Cumbrian-made beds and rain showers. Coffee, tea and chocolate biscuits are provided, and Wi-Fi is free.

The heroic “lion of London Bridge” has been caught on camera launching a racist tirade at a group of protesters.

Roy Larner was hailed as a hero in the wake of the London Bridge terror attack, after having shouting “f*** you I’m Millwall” as he took on the three attackers with his bare hands. Supporters raised more than £50,000 to get the unemployed Londoner back on his feet.

But newly emerged video, which was filmed in February, shows him shouting racist slurs and spitting in a man’s face. It is not clear how the argument with anti-racism protesters was initiated, with the footage only showing Mr Larner apparently becoming angry after being photographed.

Mr Larner is seen walking two dogs as he launches into a tirade of racist abuse and spits in the face of a black cameraman.

“Foreigners, c**t,” Mr Larner shouts at the protesters. “Foreign c**ts. F*** off. F*** off you rapist c**ts.

"W*nkers, people like you stink like sh*t,” he says as the video comes to a close.

When one of the protestors walks up to Mr Larner and appears to headbutt him, Mr Larner retreats. As he does so he repeatedly shouts “National Front” and points to himself.

His mother has since said that the protesters had said something about the dogs he was walking and that he was standing up to them in response.

"They said something to Roy about the dogs, when he was taking them for a walk,” she said. "These blokes, about four or five of them said something to Roy and he turned round and you know, he'll stand up to anyone.

"I don't know what they said to him, I was in a hurry and we were not really talking at the time.

"He was taking the dogs for a walk and was on his way back to his girlfriend's, he gave them a mouthful.

"He is certainly quite a character, he can be a bit of a handful."

She added that during London Bridge attack Roy would have died if the police had not arrived. Phyllis added: "Roy is doing alright, I never realised how bad he was stabbed I cannot believe how he got out of it alive.

"If the police had not got there in time I do not think he would have survived.

"I cannot believe how he survived that."

The video was shot in February in the Elephant and Castle area of London, apparently during a student protest. It was posted months before Mr Larner was hailed as a hero for his actions in the Black & Blue bar at London Bridge, but has emerged in the wake of the huge number of donations that have been raised for him.

The video has been posted online under the caption “hero?”

Mr Larner, who friends have said was homeless at the time of the attack, was taken to St Thomas’s Hospital after fending off the attackers.

The Independent has attempted to contact Mr Larner for comment.

It's one of the biggest business deals in a long time for Airbus. The aircraft manufacturer is selling 140 of its planes to China. Including its A320 and A350 aircraft.. a deal worth almost 23 billion dollars. The planes will be bought by a state-owned aviation company..And then allocated to Chinese airlines. It's the first major news from Airbus since the company's restructure.. And merge of its parent company and its dominant planemaking arm. More deals could also be on the way.. China is said to be interested in Airbus's A380 superjumbo.. That would be a welcome boost to the company's new jet airliner... Which has recently seen sales stall.

With less than a week to go until the general election, it seems that celebrities have been unusually silent on the endorsement front.

As Sky News asks, where are "Joey Essex's selfie sessions with Nick Clegg? Or Simon Cowell praising the Tories?" Still, a smattering of British stars have come out to endorse their party of choice – and that seems to be almost exclusively Labour.

It's no surprise in some ways – showbiz has historically tilted to the left – but the support of Labour-leaning celebrities could make a difference given how much Jeremy Corbyn needs young voters to turn up at the polls. The New York Times has published a story headlined "Why British Hip-Hop Just Might Save the Labour Party" in response to leading grime artists telling their millions of followers to register to vote – and, in virtually all cases, supporting Corbyn. One new website, grime4corbyn.com, has promised free tickets to a secret grime show for anyone registering to vote.

Any Conservative-leaning celebrities, meanwhile, have kept an extremely low profile, perhaps in keeping with the "shy Tory" phenomenon which has often thrown pollsters. They've been quieter than in 2015 when several big names threw their weight behind the blue party.

Here's a rundown of who's supporting who:

Russell Brand

Back in 2015 the comedian attracted ire for saying there was no point in voting. He's since had a change of heart. Writing in the Huffington Post, he said: "You know I never actually said 'don't vote'? I said: 'There's no point in voting when the main political parties are basically indistinguishable.'" He goes on to throw his weight behind the Labour leader, saying "Jeremy Corbyn has somehow been in politics for decades with his integrity perfectly preserved, like his much derided beard has functioned as hairy formaldehyde for his principles."

Stormzy

"My man, Jeremy! Young Jeremy, my guy. I dig what he says," British grime's leading light told The Guardian last year. "I saw some sick picture of him from back in the day when he was campaigning about anti-apartheid and I thought: yeah, I like your energy." Since then other grime artists including Professor Green, JME and Akala have come out in support.

Ronnie O'Sullivan

The snooker player tweeted he had joined the Labour Party.



Just joined the Labour Party to support @jeremycorbyn to be the next Prime minister. join Here https://t.co/zYs6c6SPyL — Ronnie O'Sullivan (@ronnieo147) April 24, 2017

"Let's hope for Corbyn's sake that O'Sullivan's endorsement lends him more luck than it did Ed Miliband back in 2015," The Spectator says.

Eddie Izzard

The comedian has once again been banging the drum for Labour, turning up on the campaign trail to show support.



Make sure you are registered to vote! https://t.co/jVkt5zXHbJ — Eddie Izzard (@eddieizzard) April 30, 2017

John Cleese

The funnyman tweeted last month that he supported the Lib Dems and Labour.

Introducing Proportional Representation ; Cleaning up the London Press ; Cleaning up British Banking

So I'll support the Lib Dems and Labour — John Cleese (@JohnCleese) May 21, 2017

That said, he also tweeted, "People are asking me how I shall vote. I shan't. I live in Chelsea and Kensington, so under our present system my vote is utterly worthless."

Lily Allen

The pop star the Daily Mail loves to hate is supporting Labour, obviously. She even retweeted this image of another starry supporter – Danny DeVito.

London with my DN hat. Jeremy June 8th. Show us how it's done! pic.twitter.com/dYM4XQXEEq — Danny DeVito (@DannyDeVito) May 27, 2017

Brian May

Queen's legendary guitarist has been on the attack, posting a series of anti-Tory tweets.

Incredible that Theresa May's self-serving agenda is now so visible. Somehow I don't think the Daily Mail will be reporting this ! Bri https://t.co/EDsPUQlc4J — Dr. Brian May (@DrBrianMay) June 2, 2017

Rob Delaney

The Catastrophe actor and Twitter comedian has pledged his support to Labour.

If the NHS or schools are a priority for you, I encourage you to vote Labour & kick the Tories out on their #buttocks. https://t.co/UE5UFaKdoC — rob delaney (@robdelaney) April 24, 2017

Kate Bush

While she hasn't said anything about the snap election, Bush told the Canadian publication Macleans last year that she thought Theresa May was "wonderful" and a "very intelligent woman".

Gary Barlow

Barlow campaigned for the Tories back in 2010. In the last election, then-shadow chancellor Ed Balls berated the Conservatives for wheeling him out. "The idea that someone who doesn't pay any tax in Britain should be telling British people how to vote will stick in the craw," he said. As The Guardian drily noted at the time, "the idea that he could be their secret weapon for a second time is a genuinely terrifying one".

Newcastle crown court, where Katherine High will be sentenced. She was found guilty of breaching health and safety regulations at her sadomasochist club Hugh Macknight/PA

The owner of a swingers’ club and sex dungeon endangered the lives of her clients by locking them in without a fire escape, a court has heard.

Katherine High, 40, breached health and safety regulations at her sadomasochist private members’ club, Vivente, where she would host as many as 60 people. The four-floor club occupied two neighbouring houses and included pool tables, bars and the basement dungeon, which was advertised as being “complete with St George’s cross, stocks, sex-swing and plenty of implements to inflict pain”.

High pleaded guilty this week to five counts of breaching regulations at Sunderland magistrates’ court. The venue has been shut down. Jim Wotherspoon, prosecuting on behalf of Sunderland city council and Tyne and Wear fire service, said that a…

DUBLIN Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker said on Thursday the Doha-based carrier would soon start buying shares in American Airlines (AAL.O) "depending on the share price."

The state-owned company notified American Airlines last month that it was interested in buying up to 10 percent of its shares.

Al-Baker told reporters in Dublin that Qatar Airways would buy up to 4.75 percent, despite a cool response given last month by the American Airlines CEO to its plan, once it has regulatory approval.

Urgent talks are underway at Stormont on a power-sharing deal that would allow Northern Ireland to appoint a new executive and resume governing.

Politicians have until Thursday afternoon to come to an arrangement or face the possibility of direct rule from Westminster for the fifth time since 2000. The province has been with a government since March and without a first and deputy first minister since January.

However, the parties were reportedly "deadlocked" on issues including a standalone Irish language act and the leadership of the new assembly.

The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) argue that provisions for Ulster Scots and Orange Identity should also be part of any new legislation, RTE reports.

In addition, former first minister Arlene Foster’s leadership of the party is under fire over her championing a controversial renewable heating scheme expected to cost £1bn over the next 20 years.

Nevertheless, Sinn Fein hinted on Tuesday it might back down on Foster returning to head the government if the DUP "gave grounds on other matters", News Letter reports.

Adding to the problem is the DUP's agreement with Theresa May that will give Northern Ireland £1bn in extra funding in exchange for the party backing Tory legislation on Brexit, security and budgets.

Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams told The Independent the deal "provides a blank cheque for a Tory Brexit which threatens the Good Friday Agreement", complicating the Stormont talks.

Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have finalised their bitter divorce after months of public spats.

The Pirates of the Caribbean star - who was accused of domestic violence by Heard after their split in April - has agreed to pay her $7 million (£5.7m), which she has pledged to donate to charity.

The actress, 30, will also keep their dogs, Pistol and Boo, and a horse named Arrow.

A confidentiality provision calls for them to refrain from discussing their relationship in interviews or on social media.

After the divorce was finalised, Depp’s Lawyer Laura Wasser said that they were “pleased to put this unpleasant chapter” behind them.

“Having his request for entry of the dissolution judgment granted today made it a particularly lucky Friday the 13th," her statement added.

Heard's lawyer Pierce O'Donnell said she “would be very happy to move on with her life."

On the same day, Depp launched a $25 million (£20.5m) lawsuit against his former business managers.

The 53-year-old claimed he had been the victim of "gross mismanagement" by The Management Group (TMG) which has cost him "tens of millions of dollars".

According to documents filed with the Los Angeles Superior Court, Depp claims the company and its owners, Joel and Robert Mandel, failed to properly pay his taxes, made unauthorised loans and overpaid for security and other services.

He has filed 11 complaints, including fraud, breach of contract and professional negligence.

"In essence, TMG treated Mr Depp's income as their own, available to either TMG or third parties to draw upon as desired," the complaint states.

TMG’s Lawyer Michael Kump said the lawsuit was a "fabrication" and the firm did "everything possible to protect Depp from his irresponsible and profligate spending".

He also claimed the Pirates Of The Caribbean actor owed TMG $4.2 million (£3.4m) from a five million-dollar loan it provided.

"His tactics and lawsuit will fail, and he will be forced to pay back the loan as promised," Mr Kump added.

Publishers of the famous Famous Five books were not amused by the title of the play chosen by Cambridge graduates for an Edinburgh Fringe performance

It was envisaged as a jolly jape until young comedians found themselves in lashings of trouble after they attempted to lampoon a much-loved series of childhood tales.

A group of Cambridge graduates planned to perform Five Go Off on One!, an affectionate parody of Enid Blyton’s sleuthing yarns, at this year’s Edinburgh Fringe festival.

However, the quintet became a less famous four after they received a legal threat from the publisher which owns the rights to the classic books.

Hachette sent a warning letter to the team behind the pastiche after details of the show appeared in the programme for the world’s largest arts event.

They were less than amused by the comedians’ intention to “lovingly ridicule” the Famous Five series which, before Harry Potter,…

This is what's left standing in the Japanese city of Asakura, after torrential rains blasting the area on Thursday (July 6) took a tragic turn. One person has been discovered dead, buried in a landslide and at least a dozen people are missing, including a child. Residents telling horror stories of family members being swept away by the waters, or trees tearing through walls of their residences. Flooding rivers have forced about 400 thousand people from their homes, with landslides reported in several areas. The government rushing to send aid, with over 75 hundred rescuers mobilized to help with evacuations. That includes police, firefighters and soldiers. 50 helicopters are also on standby and officials warn the storm isn't over. "There is still chance of more torrential rain. I urge everyone in Japan to pay attention to weather information updates from radio and television broadcasts," said Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary. Local media reports say the area saw about 770 millimeters of rain on Wednesday (July 5), more than double the amount it usually sees.

When President Donald Trump meets Russian leader Vladimir Putin late this week, many will be watching to see whether they discuss alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election.

That much is obvious. Less obvious, but more important, is how any Russian meddling in the American presidential-election season—whatever form it may have taken—fits into a much larger tale. This is the tale of a systematic Russian effort to disrupt...

Europe’s top tech hubs tend to radiate from massive capital cities like London, Berlin and Paris. But the heart of European innovation isn’t a major metropolis –it’s a small city in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy.

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe's Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution's ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world's most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it's important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it's still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Comments

201 entries, a small handful with TAGINE for TAJINE, another of those alternative spellings that Chambers annoyingly fails to give a dummy entry of its own with an appropriate cross-reference. There are far too many of these in C. for my liking. Favourite clue, of 14 mentioned, was ‘Err with maid getting knocked up? Did the honest thing maybe’ (MARRIED), which just pipped ‘Teacher flipped about producer of bad spelling, bursting blood vessel?’ (RHEXIS), in what was very much a two-horse contest. My MARRIED clue was variously described as ‘one of Azed’s naughties’ and ‘more Private Eye than Observer’. I hope no one was too shocked by it.

No doubt MASON has been clued many times, by others as well as by me, but I can’t recall seeing any of the clues quoted above before. I expected, and got, quite a few variations on the ‘mother and child’ approach, some referring to the Simon & Garfunkel song ‘Mother and child reunion’ though the idea of their being reunited seemed inappropriate and irrelevant here. I know little about the bizarre rituals observed by Freemasons beyond the oft-told tales of trouser-legs and funny handshakes, but although they belong to lodges I don’t think they are ever referred to as ‘lodgers’, are they? And can anyone explain to me why being ‘on the square’ (new to me before this competition) refers to membership of Freemasonry? Some floor design perhaps.

I’m grateful to the two regulars who tracked down the Ximenes puzzle I referred to in the last slip but one, in which alcoholic drinks had to be replaced by non-alcoholic ones. X entitled it ‘On the Wagon’ and it was reproduced in The Penguin Book of Ximenes Crossword Puzzles (1972) though when it first appeared in The Observer (during Lent, one surmises) is unclear. X died in 1971.

LONDON Sterling steadied in a quiet morning of trading on Thursday, with a run of weaker British economic data failing to deter investors from bets that the Bank of England will hike interest rates in the coming months.

Though the pound has weakened a little this week as purchasing managers' index (PMI) surveys have pointed to a cooling economy, it is still only around a cent away from nine-month highs hit against the dollar in May.

It was flat on Thursday at $1.2935 and at 87.74 pence per euro.

Its recent strength, say analysts, is largely down to expectations of monetary tightening from the BoE, with some investors betting on a rate hike as soon as next month.

Analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a note to clients that despite data pointing to weakness following June's parliamentary elections they were "loving" sterling, and noted that "soft" indicators such as PMI surveys had also dipped immediately after last year's Brexit vote, before recovering.

"Our sterling optimism finds its sterling in what we call ‘Brexit economics’ and the BoE reconsidering GBP weakness and its impact on the economy," they wrote.

"Sterling weakness has undermined living standards, and with inflation above the BoE’s 2 percent target and its own staff projections, stabilisation should now be on the BoE’s agenda. Talking up rate expectations is a sufficient tool to reach this target."

A number of BoE policymakers, including Governor Mark Carney, have spoken in recent weeks in favour of soon reversing last year's interest rate cut, which followed Britain's vote to leave the European Union.

The hawkish remarks have helped the pound to reverse the 2 percent drop against the dollar that came after a snap election on June 8 left no party with a clear majority.

But some investors are still anxious about Britain's economic prospects as it negotiates its way out of the EU, and about political instability.

"The BoE is the toughest call because the UK economy has outperformed and inflation has ramped up. However, the odds that Brexit leads to economic underperformance seem high enough to make us wonder how much of a bad streak the BoE would be willing to contemplate before taking hikes off the table," wrote Steven Englander, head of research at hedge fund Rafiki Capital.

"Carney's hiking comment in Sintra was pretty conditional at the end of the day," he added, referring to the BoE governor's saying that a rate rise was likely to be needed as the economy comes closer to running at full capacity, and that the central bank would debate when to do so "in the coming months".

What would Jesus do? It’s a common enough question, and it'd be wrong to deride it. Whether you believe in talking donkeys or the Virgin birth or any of the other challenging stuff in the Bible, it is perfectly reasonable to consider some moral dilemma against the teachings of Christ, that usually being a reasonable approximation of a humane, if not humanist, solution.

What, then, do you think Jesus would have thought about Fixed Odds Betting Terminals, as legalised by, and regulated under, the Gambling Act 2005, one of the less lovely legacies of the Blair era? Father Michael (Sean Bean) in Broken was militantly clear: you should follow the example of Christ driving out the money changers from the temple.

What’s more, Father Michael went on, according to St John’s Gospel Christ didn’t just chuck their tables around but took a whip to the olden days bankers as well – inflicting actual bodily harm on them. A sledgehammer, if not the whip, was what one member of his flock, Chloe Demichelis (Lauren Lyle), had already taken into her local betting shop to end the productive lives of four FOBTs, which admittedly are the devil’s work.

It was an act, as the priest put it about Our Lord’s pioneering act of violence, of “righteous anger” against those who’d profit from the desperation of the needy. We had seen how Chloe’s mum had taken her own life after becoming addicted to them, the “crack cocaine of gambling”, as so many do. Morally defensible, but still criminal damage and leaves you open to a restraining order and a possible prison sentence.

So the sixth episode of Broken was following the pattern of the previous five, grinding its way through the familiar series of social problems being endured by families just about not managing at the arse end of Theresa May’s Britain. Mental illness, pressurised police, food banks, truanting kids, gambling addiction, the benefits system – you name it, and there was usually a call in to the priest.

Some of the details of the various storylines, such as when Christina Fitzsimmons (Anna Friel) tries to deceive the authorities about the death of her mother in the first episode, may have stretched credulity, but the background reality cannot be challenged. If anything, as the Grenfell Tower disaster may yet prove, Broken’s unstinting catalogue of social evils understates what is happening to the poorest in society.

The actors’ performances and the photography in Broken were flawless, in the sense that they made the dramatic best of this subject matter. And yet the whole seemed less than the sum of its parts. This is because the central premise of a Roman Catholic priest occupied 24/7 with the most appalling crimes and circumstances were just not successful. Too many of the set-piece speeches were clumsily political, and even when characters were on hand to balance things. For example, Phil Davis was excellent as the vexed betting-shop owner, but his confrontation with Chloe was rendered as some sort of sub-Socratic dialogue. It didn’t work, despite the obvious skill and effort and passion writer Jimmy McGovern put into it.

Still, I could have forgiven Broken all of that sort of stuff were it not for a final scene, which saw some of his congregation repeatedly utter the mantra “you wonderful priest” to Father Michael as he dished out the wafers at Holy Communion. As someone brought up to believe in the Catechism literal truth of transubstantiation, which is that you are literally putting a sliver of the body of Christ in your mouth during Mass (a disturbing thought for an eight-year old fussy eater), I can believe most things – but I really couldn't believe that final scene. It was, frankly, ridiculous. Up to that point Father Michael had functioned as a sort of semi-credible cross between Mother Theresa and Dennis Skinner, but this is when all the tendentiousness and sentimentality just went absurd. The mass is ended, go in peace.

It’s trendy for politicians to go on about mental health, and maybe they’re sincere about it. Maybe there isn’t the money to do all we would wish to as a caring nation. Well, obviously there isn’t, judging by the strains witnessed in the latest instalment of the BBC’s excellent series Hospital.

I doubt I’ll forget the story of Carl, who we learned had been a happy-go-lucky, cricket-loving family man who drove the 182 bus to Harrow for a living. Now wandering the streets confused and mildly aggressive, he’d wound up in A&E at St Marys Hospital in London, a microcosm of a national crisis. A casualty ward was not the right place for his care, nor for the many other demented, tormented souls who found themselves there via some personal crisis or other.

We saw how Carl’s wife devoted Tricia – they’ve been together for 35 years - arrived to take him home and how she desperately she wanted to carry on caring for him, but his dementia and violence got so bad that he was committed to an acute mental health unit. She visits him every day. It’s a tiny glimpse into the reality of mental illness, and just the saddest thing I’ve seen on TV for ages. I hope the politicians were watching too.

It used to be said that a trainer who felt there were several potential Derby winners in the stable did not in truth have even one. But not any more. Aidan O’Brien once sent eight horses to the Classic and left Epsom empty-handed but his six-strong team on Saturday produced a 40-1 winner in Wings Of Eagles, a colt with just a handful of backers among the countless thousands crammed on to the Downs.

The victory of Wings Of Eagles was the biggest surprise in the Derby since Snow Knight’s success at 50-1 in 1974, and the first for a horse at a double-figure price since High-Rise at 20-1 in 1998. On the day, however, there was no fluke about it, and while Wings Of Eagles and Padraig Beggy hit the front only a few strides from the line, they won a shade cosily in the end.

There were echoes of Pour Moi’s charge through the field to victory in 2011 as his son Wings Of Eagles passed horse after horse in the Epsom straight, building momentum all the time and closing steadily on the leaders. Two furlongs out, though, most eyes were glued to his stable companion, Cliffs Of Moher, and O’Brien’s principal jockey Ryan Moore, as they glided past market rival Cracksman and into a useful lead.

The stage was set for Cliffs Of Moher to stride clear but he simply stayed on without quickening as the race reached its climax, as Wings Of Eagles and Beggy chased them down and claimed victory by three-quarters of a length.

Before the race, some might have questioned O’Brien’s apparent wish to run almost every three-year-old colt with a pulse in Saturday’s Classic. A few minutes later, the wisdom of covering every possible base was unarguable, as Wings Of Eagles fulfilled the promise in his pedigree, which has the family of the 1995 Derby winner Lammtarra on his dam’s side to complement Pour Moi.

This was O’Brien’s fourth Derby success in the last six years and his sixth in all, one more than Sir Michael Stoute’s (current) total of five between 1981 and 2010, and just one behind the all-time record of seven wins in the Classic. All three of the trainers to saddle seven winners – Robert Robson, John Porter and Fred Darling – were active in a much less competitive era, and sent out their final Derby winners in 1823, 1899 and 1941 respectively. O’Brien, though, is closing in and seems sure to catch and pass them all before too many more seasons are out.

The trainer made it clear that Wings Of Eagles had been seen as a possible winner beforehand, despite his starting price and a defeat at the hands of Venice Beach, who finished 12th, on his previous start at Chester. That said, he may still suspect that Cliffs Of Moher will prove to be a better horse in the long term.

“He was working very well and we were delighted with him at Chester,” O’Brien said. “Padraig was always going to take his time on him and produce him and he gave him a marvellous ride.”

He added of Cliffs Of Moher: “I was delighted with the second horse. All those really well-bred, good-looking horses, they can make dramatic improvement from race to race, and we knew that they had all improved [from their trial runs].

40-1 outsider Wings Of Eagles shocks rivals to win the Derby – live! Read more

“I didn’t really know what was going to happen. I thought Ryan’s horse was open to the most improvement, which he was and he did, but Ryan said he got there and he just got tired in his hands. I was half-afraid that that could happen, but we’d just about made the race. If he hadn’t run at Chester, he wouldn’t have made it here. He came with his long, sustained run and in the last 100 yards it just told, the lack of preparation.”

Michael Tabor, a former bookmaker and one of the co-owners of Wings Of Eagles in John Magnier’s Coolmore Stud syndicate, said that he had felt before the race that any one of their six runners could make the step up to win. “We knew Wings Of Eagles was in the mix, but no more than that,” Tabor said. “He’s proved to be a very, very good horse for the future but I’m afraid I didn’t back him and I didn’t have a bet in the race.”

The betting suggested beforehand that this was one of the most open Derbys for years but the fact that a 40-1 chance crossed the line in front does not necessarily mean that it was a sub-par renewal. That will become apparent only in his remaining starts, but however his career plays out, Wings Of Eagles and Beggy are Derby winners, and nothing will ever change that.

Spurs midfielder Dele Alli scored his 16th goal of the season and reinforced his credentials as the best young midfielder in Europe as Tottenham kept up their pursuit of Chelsea with an emphatic 4-0 win over Watford.

Ahead of his 21st birthday this week, the England star has more Premier League goals and assists than Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Paul Scholes and Cristiano Ronaldo at that age.

"In fact, Alli's combined total of 40 means he has had a hand in as many Premier League goals before turning 21 as Lampard (15), Gerrard (13) and David Beckham (12) combined," says Matt Law of the Daily Telegraph.

Turning 21 represents a coming of age, says Sachin Nakrani of The Guardian. "On a personal level that may well prove the case for the Tottenham Hotspur midfielder, yet in a sporting sense it already feels he is a fully grown performer, a player with man-size capabilities.

"That is evident to anyone who has watched him this season as game after game, week after week, Alli has displayed a level of skill, drive and intelligence that belies his tender years."

His potential is "frightening", says Gary Jacob of The Times. "The Tottenham midfielder has an eye for a chance and has displayed the full range of his versatility of late, arriving with perfect timing to make tap-ins look simple, pulling away for headers and, on Saturday, curling in a beautiful shot that opened the floodgates.

"All his goals are scored with frightening efficiency. There is something so captivating about Alli that it is hard, even for those with strong rival allegiances, not to express admiration."

It is worth comparing Alli's achievements to those of Paul Pogba, the world's most expensive footballer, says Jamie Redknapp in the Daily Mail.

"After a sensational campaign, Alli has eclipsed Pogba. If the United midfielder cost a world-record £89m, then what does that make Alli worth? He is becoming the perfect player."

Alli's free role at Spurs suits him perfectly, adds Redknapp: "I love his footballing arrogance. Alli knows how good he is and, if he does not leave England he has the ability to become the best attacking midfielder in Premier League history."

LONDON Britain summoned North Korea's ambassador to condemn the country's latest missile launch, the Foreign Office said on Thursday, calling on Pyongyang to give up its pursuit of nuclear and ballistic missiles.

"The actions of the DPRK are a direct violation of multiple Security Council resolutions and are a threat to regional and international security," Foreign Office minister Mark Field said.

"I call on the North Korean regime to change course and focus on the welfare of its people, instead of the illegal pursuit of its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes."

The meeting took place on Wednesday.

There was a time not so long ago, when Chris Christie, the man currently at the centre of a rather sad controversy about 45 minutes he spent on a beach, was soaring pretty high.

As an experienced state governor, with a proven record as a prosecutor, he was among the early favourites in the pack of Republican presidential hopefuls. He had a reputation as a straight-talker, a bruiser who didn’t let any slight against him or his family pass.

And he had the swagger to go with it. In February 2016, during the primary contest in New Hampshire, he still maintained dreams of the Oval Office. “For the people of the UK, they should know they will have a president who cherishes the relationship with that nation, and who looks forwarding to visiting as president of the United States,” he told The Independent, as he claimed he would win.

Christie said he was forced to close the beaches, as part of a government shutdown (AP)

When that didn’t work out – Christie dropped out the following day after a poor showing – the New Jersey governor quickly threw crucial support behind Donald Trump, a candidate he had once had harsh words for. He started travelling with the New York tycoon, and opening for him at campaign events.

While Trump frequently mocked his sidekick – there were reports Christie was sometimes dispatched to collect Trump’s burgers – by the summer of 2016, his name was said to be on a shortlist of people being considered for vice president. At the very least, Christie may have expected a slot as Attorney General.

Chris Christie 'treasures' US-UK relationship

It was not to be. After being dropped as the head of Trump’s transition team, Christie was most recently given the tiniest of consolation prizes, when he was asked to advise the White House on how to tackle the nation’s opioid epidemic.

Most powerfully, Christie is now remembered as the man burned by Trump, and who has nothing to show for it other than a beach chair, and a approval rating among the people of New Jersey of just 15 per cent. It is, by some measure, the worst of any of the country’s 50 governors.

Few things sum the Christie’s pitiful fall, wrapped up with a scandal over an incident in which his top aides ordered the closure of a bridge in an attempt to hurt a political rival, than the drama that played out on the beaches of New Jersey this extended holiday weekend.

Christie was among the first senior Republicans to declare support for Trump (AP)

Confronting a partial government shutdown as he sought to agree a budget bill with his political opponents, Christie said he had been forced to shut down the state’s beaches. The issue may have blown over, had it not been for Andy Mills, an enterprising photographer from the local paper, The Star-Ledger, who hired a Cessna 152 two-seater and took to the skies to see if the beach ban applied to everyone.

It was at that point, that Mills spotted someone he thought looked very much like Christie, sitting on a piece of private beach attached to one of the Governor’s official houses on Island Beach State Park.

It’s beyond words. If I were gov, sure wouldn’t be sitting on beach if taxpayers didn’t have access to state beaches https://t.co/VBtBpoUUkv — Kim Guadagno (@KimGuadagnoNJ) July 3, 2017

“I’m looking, I’m like, 'that’s him,’ there’s no doubt in my mind that’s him,” Mills later recalled.

When the newspaper printed the rather unflattering of images of Christie slumped on a beach chair in a baseball cap, Christie may have risen to the occasion and chuckled. He might have laughed it off, and applauded the newspaper’s ambition.

Instead, he resorted to the sort of scorn, frequently employed by Trump, the man he once sought to serve. “What a great bit of journalism by The Star-Ledger. They actually caught a politician being where he said he was going to be with the people he said he was going to be with, his wife and children and their friends,” he scoffed. “I am sure they will get a Pulitzer for this one.”

Things got even more ridiculous, when his official spokesman claimed Christie didn’t “get any sun” because of the cap he was wearing.

Christie will soon be gone from the Governor’s mansion. An election for his successor is scheduled for November. The Republican candidate, Lt Gov Kim Guadagno, was among those to criticise his antics.

“If I were governor, I sure wouldn’t be sitting on the beach if taxpayers didn’t have access to state beaches,” she said.

If the people of New Jersey will not be sad to see him go, it’s not hard to understand why. As The New York Times pointed out, along with the Bridgegate scandal, residents have also seen their governor using a state helicopter paid for by taxpayers to attend his son’s baseball game, and were then horrified to see him celebrating in 2015 with Jerry Jones, the owner of the rival Dallas Cowboys football team.

All the while, as these dramas were playing out in New Jersey, Christie was chasing around the country as the bag man of Trump. People saw him as someone so desperate for power that he was willing to do anything. That is not a good look.

The single green advantage of diesel has disappeared, according to research showing that the average new car consumes almost as much fuel as the average petrol model.

Previous governments used tax incentives to encourage drivers to buy diesel cars to help meet climate change targets. The cars were said to be greener because they consumed less fuel per mile and so produced lower greenhouse gas emissions. The tax incentives ignored the far higher air pollution emitted.

The efficiency advantage has been eroded by bigger, more powerful diesel cars, according to research by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT).

People who go to the best private schools are more likely to end up with drug and alcohol addictions in later life, new research has suggested.

“Privileged” students who live in affluent areas and attend elite schools are at a high risk of turning to cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy, the group of researchers claimed, as well as being more prone to alcohol abuse.

Girls from top schools are said to be three times more likely to suffer from drugs and alcohol-related problems than their less privileged peers, even in cases where they performed “exceedingly well” in school and were highly thought of by teachers and friends.

Boys from the same backgrounds were said to be twice as likely as other male students to becoming addicted to drink or substances in early adulthood.

Studying the habits of two groups of students in affluent communities in New England in the US, researchers from Arizona State University (ASU) assessed teenage participants when they were high school seniors, then again annually across four college years, and from the age of 23 to 27.

“We found alarmingly high rates of substance abuse among young adults who we initially studied as teenagers,” said Professor Suniya Luthar, a professor of psychology who led the research at ASU.

“Results showed that among both men and women and across annual assessments, these young adults had substantial elevations, relative to national norms, in frequency of several indicators - drinking to intoxication and of using marijuana, stimulants such as Adderall, cocaine, and club drugs such as ecstasy.”

Between 19 and 24 per cent of women in the older cohort were found to have some form of addiction, compared with 23 to 40 per cent of men by the age of 26.

“These rates were three and two times as high respectively, as compared to national norms,” said Prof Luthar.

World's 10 deadliest street drugs







10 show all World's 10 deadliest street drugs

















1/10 10. Purple Drank One of the more unusual drugs around at the moment, purple drank was popularised in 90s hip hop culture, with the likes of Jay Z and Big Moe all mentioning it in their songs. It is a concoction of soda water, sweets and cold medicine, and is drunk due to cold medicines high codeine content, which gives the user a woozy feeling. However it can also cause respiratory issues and heart failure

2/10 9. Scopolamine Scopolamine is a derivative from the nightshade plant found in the Northern Indian region of South America (Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela). It is generally found in a refined powder form, but can also be found as a tea. The drug is more often used by criminals due its high toxicity level (one gram is believed to be able to kill up to 20 people) making it a strong poison. However, it is also believed that the drug is blown into the faces of unexpecting victims, later causing them to lose all sense of self-control and becoming incapable of forming memories during the time they are under the influence of the drug. This tactic has reportedly been used by gangs in Colombia where there have been reports of people using scopolamine as way to convince victims to rob their own homes

3/10 8. Heroin Founded in 1874 by C. R. Alder Wright, heroin is one of the world’s oldest drugs. Originally it was prescribed as a strong painkiller used to treat chronic pain and physical trauma. However in 1971 it was made illegal under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Since then it has become one of the most destructive substances in the world, tearing apart communities and destroying families. The side effects of heroin include inflammation of the gums, cold sweats, a weak immune system, muscular weakness and insomnia. It can also damage blood vessels which can later cause gangrene if left untreated

4/10 7. Crack cocaine Crack cocaine first came about in the 1980’s when cocaine became a widespread commodity within the drug trafficking world. Originally cocaine would have attracted a high price tag due to its rarity and difficulty to produce, but once it became more widespread the price dropped significantly. This resulted in drug dealers forming their cocaine into rock like shapes by using baking soda as a way of distilling the powder down into rock form. People were doing this because it allowed for them to sell cocaine at a lower quantity and to a higher number of people. The side effects of crack cocaine include liver, kidney and lung damage, as well as permanent damage to blood vessels, which can often lead to heart attacks, strokes, and ultimately death

5/10 6. Crystal meth Not just famous because of a certain Walter H White, but also because it is one of the most destructive drugs in the world. First developed in 1887, it became widely used during the Second World War when both sides would give it to their troops to keep them awake. It is also believed that the Japanese gave it to their Kamikaze pilots before their suicide missions. After the war crystal meth was prescribed as a diet aid and remained legal until the 1970s. Since then it has fallen into the hands of Mexican gangs and has become a worldwide phenomenon, spreading throughout Europe and Asia. The effects of crystal meth are devastating. In the short-term users will become sleep depraved and anxious, and in the long-term it will cause their flesh to sink, as well as brain damage and damage of the blood vessels

6/10 5. AH-7921 AH-7921 is a synthetic opioid that was previously available to legally purchase online from vendors until it became a Class A in January 2015. The drug is believed to have 80% of the potency of morphine, and became known as the ‘legal heroin’. While there has only been one death related to AH-7921 in the UK, it is believed to be highly dangerous and capable of causing respiratory arrest and gangrene

7/10 4. Flakka Flakka is a stimulant with a similar chemical make-up to the amphetamine-like drug found in bath salts. While the drug was originally marketed as a legal high alternative to ecstasy, the effects are significantly different. The user will feel an elevated heart rate, enhanced emotions, and, if enough is digested, strong hallucinations. The drug can cause permanent psychological damage due to it affecting the mood regulating neurons that keep the mind’s serotonin and dopamine in check, as well as possibly causing heart failure

8/10 3. Bath salts Bath salts are a synthetic crystalline drug that is prevalent in the US. While they may sound harmless, they certainly aren’t the sort of salts you drop into a warm bath when having a relaxing night in, they are most similar to mephedrone, and have recently been featured throughout social media due to the ‘zombification’ of its. The name comes from the fact that the drug was originally sold online, and widely disguised as bath salts. The side effects include unusual psychiatric behaviour, psychosis, panic attacks and violent behaviour, as well as the possibility of a heart attack and an elevated body temperature

9/10 2. Whoonga Whoonga is a combination of antiretroviral drugs, used to treat HIV, and various cutting agents such as detergents and poisons. The drug is widely available in South Africa due to South Africa’s high rate of HIV sufferers, and is believed to be popular due to how cheap it is when compared to prescribed antiretrovirals. The drug is highly addictive and can cause major health issues such as internal bleeding, stomach ulcers and ultimately death Getty Images

10/10 1. Krokodil Krokodil is Russia’s secret addiction. It is believed that over one million Russians are addicted to the drug. Users of krokodil are attracted to the drug due to its low price; it is sold at £20 a gram while heroin is sold for £60. However, krokodil is considered more dangerous than heroin because it is often homemade, with ingredients including painkillers, iodine, lighter fluid and industrial cleaning agents. This chemical make-up makes the drug highly dangerous and likely to cause gangrene, and eventually rotting of the flesh

”Among the younger cohort by the age of 22 years, rates of addiction were between 11 and 16 per cent among women - close to national norms, but 19 to 27 per cent among men, or about twice as high as national norms,” she added.

Under closer analysis, the researchers saw a pattern in that participants with higher rates of addiction had all attended the best schools.

Publishing the study in the journal Development and Psychopathology, Prof Luther suggested part of the reason behind the findings might be that pupils at these schools experience more pressure on them to achieve.

They tended to abide by a “work hard play hard” mentality, and often had more money, which helped to buy alcohol and source both prescription and recreational drugs, as well as fake IDs.

“Not all of these students were from wealthy families but most were; as parents typically had advanced educational degrees and median incomes much higher than national norms,” she added.

”And without question, most of the parents wanted their kids to head off to the best universities, as did the kids themselves.“

Global commission call for legalisation of drugs

Parents of such children could also be lulled into a false sense of security, she suggested, trusting their children to be behaving well on account of their good grades.

"Messing with drugs and alcohol really should not be trivialised as just something all kids do,” the author warned. “The earlier children start to use and the more frequently they do, the more likely it is that they will develop addictions down the line.”

Improved sex and relationships education in schools could prove to be helpful moving forward, she said, as information on the risks of drug taking and sexually transmitted diseases were all relevant and needed.

Schools should also be aware of the pressures that students are under, particularly in trying to get into the most selective universities.

Going so far as to make pupils aware of alternative life paths would also help to reduce such problems, she said, for instance “showing the kids there are role models of adults who did not go to an elite university, but who picked a college because it felt right for them and who were highly successful in life.”

“We now need the same dedicated research on kids who grow up in pressure- cooker, high achieving schools,” Luthar said. “Paradoxical though it may seem, these ostensibly privileged youth, many of who start experimenting early and often with drinking and drugs, could well be among the groups at highest risk for alcoholism and addiction in adulthood.”

TOKYO Germany's Lukas Podolski has set his sights on helping Vissel Kobe qualify for the Asian Champions League in his maiden J.League season, the World Cup-winning forward said on Thursday.

Podolski became the biggest name to arrive in the J.League since Uruguayan striker Diego Forlan joined Cerezo Osaka in 2014 when the 32-year-old signed an estimated $5.3 million deal to make the switch from Galatasaray.

"I don't feel any pressure because I have had pressure since I started playing football," Podolski, a member of Germany's 2014 World Cup winning team, told a news conference in Kobe.

"It is not a problem, it is a big challenge for me. I don't play in Europe, I play now in the J.League and Asia, so it is a big move, of course, but I have a target."

"The first target is to fight for the first three places (in the J.League) to qualify for the Champions League," said Podolski who is set to make his debut in a July 29 home match against Omiya Ardija.

Kobe had wanted Podolski to join them before the spring transfer window closed on Mar. 31 and will expect him to lift the club, currently lying 11th and 13 points behind leaders Kashima Antlers, in the second half of the season.

"I am here now to help everyone. I am not alone. I know my team mates will help me. Now we have to go train hard and fight on the pitch for 90 minutes and get three points every game," added the former Bayern Munich and Arsenal player.

Boris Johnson has been widely mocked after stumbling through a torturous interview in which he sought to set out the government's agenda.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme following the Queen's Speech yesterday, the Foreign Secretary stammered and sighed in response to questions on everything from discrimination to Theresa May's job security.

At one point, "BoJo" could be heard leafing through papers while asking presenter Eddie Mair to "hang on a second".

After he ducked a mental health question to return to a previous topic, Mair told him: "It's not a Two Ronnies sketch – you can't answer the question before last."

However, Johnson can take solace in the fact he is far from the first politician to fall apart under interview pressure. Here are five of the worst

Diane Abbott vs Nick Ferrari

An election campaign interview on LBC to discuss police funding turned into a nightmare for shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, who went blank on the key figures behind Labour's policies. Her series of embarrassing mathematical blunders included a claim that recruiting 10,000 new police officers would cost £300,000 - the equivalent, as presenter Nick Ferrari pointed out, of £30 per officer.

Abbott was excoriated for her apparently scant acquaintance with her brief, although some commentators said such criticism was motivated in part by sexism and racism.

Not long later, Abbott ducked out from the campaign altogether, suffering from an unspecified illness which she since said was diabetes.

Michael Howard vs Jeremy Paxman

During an interview in 1997, Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman asked then home secretary Michael Howard the same question 12 times and each time, the politician refused to answer.

It was a "masterclass in persistence, even if it merely led to a very uncomfortable stalemate" between two stubborn men, says The Guardian.

Chloe Smith vs Jeremy Paxman

After that tie, the journalist came out top when interviewing Tory Treasury spokeswoman Chloe Smith in 2012, when she failed miserably to defend boss George Osborne's U-turn on fuel duty.

"The result was so cringe-inducing it can only be viewed through fingers," the Daily Mirror writes.

Many branded the then chancellor a coward for ducking out of the interview. Paxman agreed, saying Osborne "should have been the one held up for public ridicule".

Nigel Farage vs James O'Brien

Ukip's Nigel Farage faced tough questions from LBC presenter James O'Brien in 2014, when the MEP was quizzed on racism, expenses and his party's links to far-right European politicians.

Farage got such a grilling that the Ukip director of communications tried to intervene to bring the exchange to a halt, writes The Guardian.

Natalie Bennett vs Nick Ferrari

Ferrari had practice ahead of his interview with Abbott. In the run-up to the 2015 general election, he was at the helm when Green Party leader Natalie Bennett made several awkward attempts to explain how her party's housing policy would be funded.

She later admitted it had been "absolutely excruciating", adding: "All I can say is occasionally one just has a mind blank. That happens."

The Daily Telegraph says it was "the interview that had the whole nation screaming: 'STOP! STOP! Fake your own DEATH if necessary. Make the horror END!' But it didn't."

As part of a deal to renew mayoral control of New York City schools, state and city leaders agreed to an administrative fix that allows a bump in the number of charters permitted in the city, two people familiar with the matter said Wednesday.

The deal would allow the reuse of 22 charters—or contracts for schools—that were previously revoked or surrendered by charters that closed or never opened. This strategy has been dubbed...

Social media users react with glee and disbelief as Tory MP reveals name of newborn son on Instagram

The Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg has provoked delight and mirth by naming his newborn son and sixth child Sixtus.

Rees-Mogg, MP for North East Somerset, announced the birth on Instagram on Wednesday.

He posted an image of himself cradling Sixtus, with the words: “Helena and I announce with great joy that we have a baby Sixtus Dominic Boniface Christopher, a brother for Peter, Mary, Thomas, Anselm and Alfred.”

One Twitter user responded: “There’s a man in touch with the challenges of modern life.”

Another said: “The thing about Jacob Rees-Mogg is that his politics [are] horrendous but I can’t bring myself to hate him because he’s from another time.”

And another wrote: “Jacob Rees-Mogg is trending because apparently we’ve had no recent lessons about not taking dangerously inept rich men in politics seriously.”

Sixtus isn’t the only one of the Rees-Mogg brood with a lengthy name. His siblings’ full names are Peter Theodore Alphege, Mary Anne Charlotte Emma, Thomas Wentworth Somerset Dunstan, Anselm Charles Fitzwilliam and Alfred Wulfric Leyson Pius Rees-Mogg.

The Old Etonian’s eccentric image has made him something of a cult figure on Instagram and Twitter. Rees-Mogg is a recent convert to social media, describing it in a recent interview as “great fun”. His Twitter background features a bucolic Somerset landscape.

The sketch writer Quentin Letts famously dubbed him “the honourable member for the early 20th century”. Rees-Mogg himself, a member of an old mining family, has said he is suspicious of politicians who try to present themselves as “men of the people”.

For some, Valentine's Day means an inconvenient rush for flowers and last-minute dinner reservations. For others, it's the most romantic time of year.

Love it or hate it, 14 February is only a day away. So why not brush up on the history, customs and superstitions of Valentine's Day, and see if inspiration strikes?

History of Valentine's Day

Like Halloween, the origins of Valentine's Day are rooted in paganism, specifically in a fertility festival known as Lupercalia, says National Geographic.

The festival – which was "wildly popular" until the fifth century AD – was celebrated annually on 15 February. It was customary for men to use whips fashioned from the skins of a goat or dog to spank young maidens in order to increase fertility.

Lupercalia was so popular that the young Christian Church was unable to stop pagans taking part, and so it eventually began to modify the festival into a Christian celebration, linking it to the legend of St Valentine.

St Valentine was executed by the Roman Emperor Claudius II after he was caught performing secret marriage ceremonies, which were at the time prohibited by the emperor in an attempt to strengthen his army.

The story goes that Valentine sent a final love note to his jailer's daughter signed, "From your Valentine", and thus Valentine's Day was born.

The introduction of the penny postage and envelopes saw the Valentine card became popular in the late 19th century. It was often decorated with lace, ribbons and messages hidden behind secret panels.

Valentine's Day around the world

Japan: Japanese chocolate companies make half their annual sales in the week leading up to Valentine's Day, although it's not the men who are shelling out their hard-earned cash. In Japan it's traditional for women to do the spoiling. It's not all rosy for the boys, though – they are expected to return the favour on White Day, which falls on 14 March.

South Korea: In Korea they take it a step further. As well as celebrating Valentine's Day and White Day, they also mark Black Day (14 April), on which people not in relationships meet in restaurants to eat black noodles and mourn/celebrate being single.

France: In days of yore, so the legend goes, the single men and women of a village would call to each other from houses on opposite sides of the road in order to find a mate. This was called a "loterie d'amour" (love lottery). If the pairing didn't work out, the scorned women would burn pictures of the men who rejected them on a bonfire while shouting vulgar insults. This eventually led to the practice being outlawed.

Germany: Although Valentine's Day didn't catch on in Germany until after World War Two, the Germans have already developed their own unique tradition for the festival – their Valentine's Day displays are just as likely to feature pigs as roses and love hearts. The pig is a traditional symbol of luck – marzipan pigs are also traditionally given to family and friends at New Year.

Finland and Estonia: Here Valentine's Day is as much a celebration of friendship as it is of romantic love. In both languages the name given to 14 February translates as Friend's Day.

Wales: In Wales, Dydd Santes Dwynwen is celebrated on 25 January, a day that commemorates St Dwynwen, the patron saint of Welsh lovers.

Mineral-rich waters off the west coast are attracting whales in growing numbers PA:Press Association

The west coast of Scotland is to be promoted as one of the best places in Europe to see whales.

The Scottish government has awarded a grant of almost £200,000 to the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust (HWDT), and the funding will go towards creating a network of 25 whale-watching sites across the west coast.

Mineral-rich waters warmed by the Gulf Stream are attracting minke, sperm, killer, fin, northern bottlenose and humpback whales in growing numbers, alongside basking sharks, porpoises and dolphins.

The announcement was part of £4.3 million of funding which has been allocated from the government’s coastal communities fund.

Roseanna Cunningham, the environment secretary, said: “With more than 10,000 miles of stunning coastline in Scotland we need to do all we can to…

Hidden down a quiet street in Berlin's Prenzlauer Berg district you'll find a chic hotel that's making quite a splash – just be sure to keep an eye out or you might walk straight past it.

Hotel Oderberger is housed within an imposing brick building (with a very discreet sign) that for almost a century served as a public bathhouse. Closed in 1986, it underwent a four-year renovation that kicked off in 2012 before reopening as a hotel in January 2016. Original features have been carefully restored, and private bathing rooms have now been turned into guestrooms.

The original pool reopened last October, and it really is spectacular; the blue-tiled bath sits within a large, echoey room that's all vaulted ceilings, columns and arches. The pool is open to the public (there are even weekly tours available), though rather surprisingly hotel guests have to pay to swim too – albeit at a discounted rate.

The Oderberger was still a work in progress during my visit in January 2017 – there were wires in the hallway waiting to be connected to light fixtures, keycard pads that hadn't been activated, and one day I was woken up at 8.30am by noisy building works in the room next door. However, the hotel told me it expected to have everything finished “asap” and, since I stayed, the restaurant has started serving breakfast. It should be fully operational by June, and the spa was unveiled this month.

The Hotel Oderberger's discreet entrance (Hotel Oderberger )

Already fully open is the cosy bar off the reception area, complete with log fire and well-stocked shelves.

Location

The hotel is five minutes on foot from the Eberswalder Strasse metro station. It's also within walking distance of the Berlin Wall Memorial; don't miss the fascinating open-air displays along the way, describing what life was like for residents of this area when the wall was erected and, in some cases, when their houses were used as the border.

Also close by is the KulturBrauerai, the “Culture Brewery”, which hosts performing arts and workshops, a Sunday street food market and a small permanent exhibition on life in the GDR.

Peckish? There are plenty of cool places to dine nearby, whether you want modern Turkish and bare brick walls at Osmans Toechter or burgers in fluffy steamed buns, with colourful graphic prints hanging overhead, at Bun Bao.

Comfort

The rooms are stylish while still retaining some original features. In my Comfort double, the old bathing room door – complete with peeling paint – had been encased in glass and used as a sliding door for the shower room, while clothes hooks, tiling and old benches were all visible in the bedroom. Walls were freshly whitewashed brick, set off by minimalist furniture, copper lamps and grey fabrics. Two freestanding radiators took up a huge amount of space and caused more than one stubbed toe – they were clearly new, so I'm not sure quite why the hotel didn't opt for a slimline wall-mounted version instead.

Rooms are modern while retaining original features (Hotel Oderberger )

As well as Premium rooms and Junior Suites, you'll find Maisonettes, which come complete with mezzanine sleeping areas, and apartments tucked into the eaves, each sleeping between two and eight people.

LONDON British trade minister Liam Fox welcomed a free trade pact between the European Union and Japan on Thursday, urging the two sides to maintain momentum as they finalise details of the deal.

European Council President Donald Tusk said on Thursday the agreement was concluded at a meeting with visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.

Signed in Brussels, the "political agreement" is heavy with symbolism and leaves some areas of negotiation still to finish, though officials insist key snags were overcome this week.

"I am pleased to see encouraging progress on such an ambitious trading agreement. I urge both sides to maintain momentum as they work towards a swift conclusion of this deal," Fox said in a statement.

With Halloween just days away, it's time once again for Americans to dig out their costumes and candy corn – and for Brits to turn off the lights, draw the curtains and pretend they're not at home.

Even the grumpiest of Halloween cynics would have to concede that the festival has a fascinating history. Modern customs may seem baldly commercial, but many are older – and stranger – than you might imagine.

The origins of Halloween

Customs now associated with Halloween have their origins in an ancient Celtic festival called Samhain (pronounced "sow'inn"), meaning summer's end. The Celts believed this was the time when the veil between this world and the next was at its thinnest, allowing the spirits of the dead to move freely among the living. It was one of the four major seasonal holidays celebrated in Celtic Ireland and Scotland, and took place around 1 November.

Around the 8th century, the Christian church began to celebrate All Hallows' Day (also called All Saints' Day), placing the holiday on 1 November in an attempt to accommodate pagan practices and thus smooth the path to conversion.

On the night before All Hallows' Day, which was marked with a feast, Christians would attend a vigil to pray for the souls of the dead and commemorate the saints believed to be in heaven. This event, known as All Hallows' Eve, became Halloween. By the Middle Ages, this tradition had evolved into an elaborate ritual, with criers dressed in black garb walking the streets to call upon the faithful to pray for the dead – it must have been an unnerving sight to early Christians, lending an eerie tone to the holy day.

Why do we 'trick or treat'?

"Halloween was the one night of the year when communities generally tolerated pranking," says The Atlantic. However, "the point was to cause mischief, not to gather treats".

But while Halloween "tricks" may be a venerable tradition, "treats" have far more recent roots.

"Mumming" – going from door to door acting out short skits in exchange for food or drink – was a common form of entertainment during festivals in the Middle Ages, but it did not have a particular association with Halloween.

In fact, trick or treating as we know it did not become a widespread phenomenon in the US until the 1940s. Until then, seasonal fruits such as apples and pumpkins would be a typical offering at a Halloween party.

Mischief Night is still celebrated in many of the UK's communities, but it has been rapidly eclipsed by American-style festivities since the 1980s.

Other well-known Halloween traditions are much older. Carving vegetables to use as lamps is an ancient practice dating back thousands of years. Halloween Jack O'Lanterns with carved faces were first documented in the 19th century, when they were placed in windows to ward off evil spirits.

The tradition of donning spooky costumes for the festival dates back to the Celts, who disguised themselves to blend in with the ghosts believed to wander the Earth on Samhain, the Gaelic festival marking the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter.

Halloween in Britain

In Scotland and parts of northern England, Halloween traditionally went by the name of Mischief Night, named after the tradition of dressing up and playing tricks on unsuspecting neighbours. Mischief Night is still celebrated in many of the region's communities, but recent decades have seen it rapidly eclipsed by American-style Halloween festivities. Interestingly, however, parts of the north-eastern United States and Canada continue to observe Mischief Night as a separate entity from Halloween, under a variety of regional names such as Cabbage Night, Devil's Night and Gate Night.

Halloween around the world

While British Halloween celebrations have increasingly followed the American lead, other nations have preserved their own traditions. Often these focus on a celebration of the dead and their effect on the living.

Mexico, Latin America and Spain: Dia de los Muertos, or the Day of the Dead, is a joyous celebration of lost relatives, who are believed to return to their houses on Halloween. The three-day celebration, which begins on 31 October, involves building an altar at home and decorating it with sweets, flowers, photographs and samples of the deceased's favourite foods.

China: The Chinese equivalent of Halloween is Teng Chieh, which celebrates the connections between the living and the dead. Families traditionally place food and water next to photographs of deceased family members, while lanterns and bonfires are lit to guide home the departed.

Japan: Japan celebrates its version of Halloween, Obon or Festival of the Lanterns, in August. According to the tradition, dead ancestors return each year to the place where they were born, guided by red lanterns hung in doorways, and released into rivers and seas on the last day of the festival.

Europe: Different European countries have their own traditions and superstitions when it comes to Halloween. In the Czech Republic, extra chairs are placed by the fireside for the spirits of family members who have died, while Austrians leave bread, water and a lighted lamp out at night to welcome dead souls back to earth.

In certain regions of Germany, families will hide their knives at Halloween to avoid hurting the returning spirits of their deceased friends and families.

Many countries, such as Sweden and Finland, also mark 1 November - All Saints' Day, when Christian saints and martyrs are remembered. It is also referred to as All Hallows' Day or Hallowmas, among other names.

Hong Kong: People in Hong Kong celebrate Yue Lan, or the Hungry Ghosts Festival, which is similar to Halloween, in summer – the date varies each year. Ghosts and spirits are said to roam the world for 24 hours while people burn pictures of fruit or money in order to comfort them.

The rate at which foreign investment into the UK is creating new jobs is slowing as Britain heads towards the exit door of the EU, Government figures show.

Statistics published by the Department for International Trade (DIT) today show new jobs created by foreign investment fell by 9 per cent last year, with the number of company expansions also falling.

Jobs created in 2015/16 were 82,650, calling to 75,226 in 2016/17, the Department said. Firms expanding were down from 821 to 782.

The UK attracted over 2,200 new inward investment projects in 2016-17, a record rate.

Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, cast the figures in a positive light – noting that the UK was attracting “record levels of investment” despite the slowing job creation rate.

“Almost one year on since the EU referendum, the UK continues to attract record levels of inward investment and remains extremely attractive to foreign investors,” he said.

“As an international economic department, we continue to promote the strengths of the UK as a great inward investment destination, with an open, liberal economy, world-class talent and business-friendly taxation.”

The DIT says investments came first and foremost from the US, with 557 projects, and China in third with 160 projects. France was in third with 131 while India, Australia and New Zealand saw 127 projects each.

Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said the fall in job creation showed Mr Fox’s department was a “disaster”.

"This report shows that Liam Fox’s department is a disaster. If the International Trade Department cannot grow international trade, what are they actually for?” he said.

"Already, I’m informed by very well informed guys and girls who are working on the area, and in the area at the moment, that there’s potentially up to a million migrants already, if not more in the pipeline coming up from Central Africa and the Horn of Africa."

Joseph Walker-Cousins, senior fellow at the Institute for Statecraft and former head of the British Embassy Office in Benghazi, speaking to the House of Lords EU External Affairs Sub-Committee on March 30, 2017.

Hard evidence on irregular migration in North Africa is a much sought after commodity; unfortunately, it is also highly unreliable. In its December 2016 assessment of the situation in Libya, the International Organisation for Migration estimated (IOM) that 425,000 internally displaced persons were resident in Libya and that “hundreds of thousands” were displaced into neighbouring countries.

Experienced researchers tend to be sceptical of official statistics on migrants for good reasons. North Africa is both a destination and a transit region for sub-Saharan migrants. It is also extremely difficult to count migrants because migration tends to be clandestine, with people moving through politically unstable regions.

Further problems with official reports and comments such as those by Joseph Walker-Cousins are that they tend to focus on Libya (and fail to look at the wider regional picture). Findings are based on indirect evidence – information from informants, detentions, returns, and arrivals in Europe – not primary research that employs sound methodologies, as fieldwork in Libya is not possible.

Unfortunately, the most likely and most effective barrier to migration – barring an effective policy response from other countries in the region – is death and detention. Thousands of migrants have died transiting the Sahara and tens of thousands are “detained” in North Africa.

While the IOM has been able to access some of the detention facilities in Libya, it has not reported on the number of people detained nor their legal status. While European development agencies are beginning to engage with trans-Saharan migration, very little hard data has emerged from their efforts other than an acknowledgement that conflict and drought in northern Nigeria, Mali, Sudan and the Horn of Africa is pushing people northwards across the Sahara.

Verdict: Are there really a million migrants ready to come?

We simply do not know how many migrants are “in the pipeline”. Nor have regional governments or the European Union agreed a viable strategy for dealing with the underlying processes driving this movement, as opposed to stopping migrants from reaching Europe. We do know two important facts. First, and as noted in the 2016 IOM study, not all sub-Saharan migrants intend to come to Europe. Second, without an accurate assessment of the situation and serious policy dialogue with transit countries, no resolution to this issue is possible.

Review, by Nando Sigona, deputy director of the Institute for Research into Superdiversity, University of Birmingham

I agree with the verdict. The story that a million African migrants are ready or in “the pipeline” to reach Europe from Libya is nothing new and Joseph Walker-Cousins’s claim has previously been aired by other variously informed people. It resurfaces periodically in the media (2015, 2016, 2017), but repetition is no proof of validity; rather it is an example of how charts and figures play a significant role in how we understand and debate the so-called refugee crisis.

On the one hand, it encapsulates the power of numbers in firing up public and political debate and sustaining the “crisis mood” that pervades policy responses to boat migration. On the other, it shows the lack of scientific rigour and yet resilience that often characterises the numbers of the “crisis” that circulate so widely in the global media and among policy makers – impermeable to attempts being made to show how baseless they are.

SHOWS: LONDON, ENGLAND, UK (JULY 2, 2017) (REUTERS - ACCESS ALL) 1. NOVAK DJOKOVIC AT PRESS CONFERENCE 2. (SOUNDBITE) (English) NOVAK DJOKOVIC, TALKING ABOUT PLAYING AND WINNING AT EASTBOURNE LAST WEEK, SAYING: "Yes it seems to be right now from this perspective, a good decision to have played Eastbourne. Obviously, I was not playing too many of the events in the week prior to the beginning of the grand slam in my career, but I have decided to do so this time because I felt like I needed more matches in general but especially on the grass that is a very unique surface that requires time for adaptation and adjustment, especially for the movement so, I felt like this time I needed a proper tournament rather than just playing a couple of exhibition matches so. "I'm glad I've made that decision and that I went to Eastbourne because it was a very positive experience, on and off the court as well. People were very kind, it was a great week with a lot of good positive energy and a lot of time spent on the practice courts, four quality matches, and just overall very happy with the way it went and where my form is at." 3. (SOUNDBITE) (English) NOVAK DJOKOVIC, TALKING ABOUT MARIO ANCIC WHO IS BECOMING PART OF HIS COACHING TEAM, SAYING: "You know, we spoke and he said he was anyway coming to London and that he would be happy to spend some time with Andre (Agassi) and myself during Wimbledon, and that's more or less everything thing we talked about. In terms of what comes after that, we'll see. We'll take a day at a time to see how everything flows during this tournament and then see where that takes us." STORY: Novak Djokovic said on Sunday (July 2) rediscovering the winning feeling on Saturday (July 1) when he scored his first tournament success since January had provided the perfect preparation for the Wimbledon Championships. The Serbian broke his normal pre-Wimbledon practice regime to accept a wild card at the Aegon International event in Eastbourne, where he claimed his 68th tour title by beating Gael Monfils 6-3 6-4. It was his first tournament win since January and has left the world number four confident of mounting a challenge at Wimbledon, where he has been drawn against Slovakia's Martin Klizan in the first round. "A lot of time spent on the practice courts, four quality matches. Just overall very happy with the way it went, and where my form is," said Djokovic who did not drop a set in winning at Eastbourne. The three-times Wimbledon champion has faced an unexpectedly rocky few months, losing his number one ranking to Andy Murray and failing to make a mark at either the Australian or French Open. That poor form led him to bring in eight-times grand slam champion Andre Agassi as coach ahead of the French Open, where he lost to Austria's Dominic Thiem in the quarter-finals, a defeat that meant he dropped out of the world's top two for the first time since 2011. Djokovic, who last won Wimbledon in 2015, has made another personnel change for the grasscourt event which starts on Monday (July 3), adding his friend and former player Mario Ancic to his coaching team alongside Agassi. "He (Ancic) said he was anyway coming to London. He would be happy to spend some time with Andre and myself during Wimbledon," said Djokovic, who added that he did not know how permanent the arrangement would be. The 12-times Grand Slam winner has not won one of tennis's glittering prizes since the 2016 French Open, leading to speculation that he has lost the desire to compete at the highest level.

The Reddit user whose gif was appropriated by Donald Trump in the president’s infamous CNN-wrestling video has apologized for creating the image – and for making a series of racist, antisemitic and Islamophobic posts.

HanAssholeSolo, who claimed to have created the gif that inspired Trump to post a video of him wrestling a man with a CNN logo superimposed on his head, said he was “trolling” when he used a series of racial slurs on Reddit, and said his gif had been “satire” that was not meant to call for violence against journalists. HanAssholeSolo’s apology came after CNN reportedly identified him.

Reddit user who took credit for Trump's CNN tweet has history of racist posts Read more

The Reddit user had faced criticism after it emerged he had repeatedly used racial slurs and posted antisemitic images to the site. In one post, HanAssholeSolo called for another commenter to “keep up the good work until the last Islamic piece of shit is wiped from the planet”.

Trump is yet to apologize for sharing the video; it is unclear how the president discovered HanAssholeSolo’s post. The White House did not respond to requests for comment on Monday, but the revelations about HanAssholeSolo’s past added to questions about the president’s internet use and sourcing.

In July 2016, Trump tweeted an antisemitic image attacking Hillary Clinton. It was later reported that the image had been taken from an internet message board used by white supremacists.

HanAssholeSolo issued his apology in a lengthy post to Reddit on Tuesday.

“First of all, I would like to apologize to the members of the Reddit community for getting this site and this sub embroiled in a controversy that should never have happened,” he wrote.

“I would also like to apologize for the posts made that were racist, bigoted, and antisemitic. I am in no way this kind of person, I love and accept people of all walks of life and have done so for my entire life.

“I am not the person that the media portrays me to be in real life, I was trolling and posting things to get a reaction from the subs on reddit and never meant any of the hateful things I said in those posts. I would never support any kind of violence or actions against others simply for what they believe in, their religion, or the lifestyle they choose to have.

“Nor would I carry out any violence against anyone based upon that or support anyone who did.”

The post has since been removed from Reddit, and HanAssholeSolo has deleted his account. In the apology he said he did not “advocate violence against the press” and that the meme “was created purely as satire”.

“I had no idea anyone would take it and put sound to it and then have it put up on the president’s Twitter feed.

“It was a prank, nothing more. What the president’s feed showed was not the original post that was posted here, but loaded up somewhere else and sound added to it then sent out on Twitter. I thought it was the original post that was made and that is why I took credit for it.

“I have the highest respect for the journalist community and they put their lives on the line every day with the jobs that they do in reporting the news.”

On Monday, CNN said it had identified the man behind the HanAssholeSolo account. The news organization said it was not publishing his name “because he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology, showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all his offending posts, and because he said he is not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again”.

CNN said it “reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change”.

Walters is likely to join four other Ireland team-mates at Burnley CHARLES MCQUILLAN/GETTY IMAGES

Burnley have had a bid of £3 million for Jon Walters accepted by Stoke City, with the Ireland forward due to undergo a medical with the Premier League club today.

As a result, Walters will become the fifth Ireland international, along with Kevin Long, Stephen Ward, Jeff Hendrick and Robbie Brady on the Lancashire club’s books. Walters scored 62 goals in 271 appearances during his seven years with Stoke, but is one of two Ireland internationals due to leave the club this week, as Aston Villa are in talks with Glenn Whelan.

The Championship side had a £500,000 bid for Whelan rejected last month but Steve Bruce, the Aston Villa manager, is hopeful of securing a deal. “I think we need to have a bit…

Girls as young as nine are opting to have surgery on their private parts because of body insecurities that stem from social media and pornography, doctors have revealed.

Naomi Crouch, a leading adolescent gynaecologist, told the BBC about the worrying trend and admitted that she is concerned GPs are referring young girls for unneeded labiaplasty - an operation where the lips of the vagina are shortened or reshaped.

As of yet, the doctor says she is yet to see a young girl who needs the operation.

“Girls will sometimes come out with comments like, 'I just hate it, I just want it removed,' and for a girl to feel that way about any part of her body - especially a part that's intimate - is very upsetting.“

Paquita de Zulueta, a GP for more than 30 years, agreed with Crouch’s concerns, adding that it is only in the past few years young women have been started seeing her with concerns about the way their vagina’s look.

“I'm seeing young girls around 11, 12, 13 thinking there's something wrong with their vulva - that they're the wrong shape, the wrong size, and really expressing almost disgust,” De Zulueta said.

She also added that the rise is the fault of pornography and social media and that, in her opinion, labiaplasty should only be performed on girls who have a medical abnormality.

“There isn't enough education and it should start really quite young, explaining that there is a range and that - just as we all look different in our faces - we all look different down there, and that's OK.”

In 2015-16, more than 200 girls under 18 had labiaplasty on the NHS, with more than 150 of the girls aged under 15.

“I find it very hard to believe there are 150 girls with a medical abnormality which means they needed an operation on their labia,” the doctor said.

The industry has been readily criticised for normalising the procedure, however, some surgeons say that it’s “insulting” to assume that most women have surgery for cosmetic reasons alone.

“The women have significant discomfort with recurrent infections and irritation because of their enlarged labia,” Christopher Inglefield, a plastic and cosmetic surgeon at the London Bridge clinic, told The Independent.

“The most extreme case I dealt with was a girl in her late teens whose labia grew abnormally large to the point that she was being teased and told she looked like a boy.

“She was very traumatised and we had to get approval from the hospital psychologist to go ahead with the surgery.”

Inglefield added that he did not know how she dealt with the discomfort she would have endured for years.

ROUGH CUT. NO REPORTER NARRATION. U.S. President Donald Trump once more urged NATO allies in Europe on Thursday (July 6) to spend more on defence, on a visit to Poland that had been billed as an opportunity for him to patch up relations after a tense alliance summit in May. He also said Washington was thinking about "severe things" in response to North Korea's test-launch this week of an intercontinental ballistic missile with the potential to reach Alaska. The White House had said Trump would use the stopover in Warsaw to showcase his commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which he once called "obsolete", bemoaning allies' repeated failure to spend the recommended 2 percent of GDP on defence.

Porsche surprised fans at the E3 games show yesterday by taking the wraps of its radical 911 GT2 RS during a demonstration of the upcoming Forza Motorsport 7 racing game.



The car is "the most aggressive expression of Porsche's legendary design", said Dan Greenawalt, head of Forza developer Turn10 Studios, and "features the most powerful road-going 911 engine ever made".



AutoExpress says the hardcore coupe has "motorsport-inspired styling and aerodynamics such as the large bonnet vents and splitter".



There's also a "huge rear wing" and large air ducts on either side to cool the rear-mounted turbocharged flat-six engine.



No performance specs were announced at the unveiling, but AutoExpress says Porsche engineers have issued a "conservative" power output estimate of 621bhp and 553lb-ft of torque.



Official figures "should be greater", adds the mag, with an expected zero to 62mph time of 2.9secs.



The GT2 RS will also adopt several chassis upgrades from the GT3, says Autocar, including "rear-axle steering" and torque vectoring, which brakes wheels individually to optimise cornering grip.



It could also be "just months away from launch", adds the site, as it appeared in production form.



The GT2 RS is Porsche's halo version of the 911 series, with the carmaker only releasing new versions of the coupe every five to ten years.



The last GT2 RS, which at the time Evo called "comedy fast" and "a challenge for drivers", appeared in 2010 and cost £164,000. The mag says the new version is expected to be priced slightly higher.

A major ransomware cyber attack has struck computers around the world, with hackers demanding $300 (£234) be paid to an anonymous Bitcoin account to decrypt users' data.

Computers in Ukraine and Russia, including the country's biggest oil company, were hit first, before the attack spread to the UK, Netherlands, France, Norway, Spain and Romania.

Chernobyl's nuclear power plant "also had to monitor radiation levels manually after its Windows-based sensors were shut down", the BBC reports.

"Online records showed that 30 victims had paid the ransom," says the New York Times. However, "other victims may be out of luck, after Posteo, the German email service provider, shut down the hackers' email account".

Cyber security experts say the ransomware appears to exploit the same vulnerability in Microsoft Windows as a previous attack which crippled the NHS in May.

"It included code known as 'Eternal Blue,' which cyber security experts widely believe was stolen from the US National Security Agency (NSA) and was also used in last month's ransomware attack, named 'WannaCry'," Reuters says.

Bill Wright, senior policy counsel for cyber security firm Symantec, said the nature of the ransomware made it difficult to fight.

"Once you unleash something that propagates in this manner, it's impossible to control," he said.

Oil's longest rally for five years came crashing to a halt yesterday, falling around four per cent in New York trading after it had surged for eight consecutive sessions and added around ten per cent from a recent low.

See related Will Brexit Britain endure an economic recession?

Brent crude, the international oil price benchmark, regained 0.8 per cent of those losses in early trading, but at $48.20 a barrel, was still more than $1.5 down on its level yesterday morning.

West Texas Intermediate, Brent's US counterpart, also pared losses, but remained down by a similar margin on its price level yesterday morning, at $45.50 a barrel.

It followed export data showing a big rise in shipments from Opec last month.

The 14-nation cartel has been the cornerstone of a deal to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day until March, which also includes major producers such as Russia.

Compliance with the deal is said to be very high, but the agreement only relates to underlying production and not exports and excludes Libya and Nigeria, two of Opec's big producers.

Because of this, shipments rose 450,000 barrels per day from the previous month and 1.9 million barrels year-on-year.

In addition, despite the cuts, oil inventories across the OECD group of advanced nations have held at near-record levels of above three billion barrels, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said.

To make matters worse, Russia has apparently ruled out deepening the production cuts, the solution most analysts have been calling for, says CNBC.

The only bright spot is rising demand in the US leading to a fall of 5.8 million barrels in its reserves last week, according to the American Petroleum Institute.

Reuters says this partly explains the modest oil price recovery this morning.

However, Jeff Kilburg, chief executive at KKM Financial asset manager, warned the oil price was "in no man's land as this tug of war of this rebalancing act continues to play out".

Oil price could return to $60 this year, says analyst

5 July

The oil price this morning took a break from its recent rally, the longest for five years, but it is predicted to continue a steady upward move in the months ahead.

Brent crude, the international oil price benchmark, was down 0.7 per cent to a shade below $49.30 as traders banked profits. It had been below $45 a barrel in the past two weeks but reached close to $50 yesterday after an eight-day rally.

UBS commodity analyst Giovanni Staunovo told MarketWatch trading will rise more than 20 per cent over the course of the second half of the year to reach $60 a barrel. It hasn't reached that level for more than two years.

"Obviously, at the moment, that looks far away. But, for me, the market has become too negative," he said.

Staunovo's optimistic forecast is based on supply restraint - Opec and other global producers are pledged to cut 1.8 million barrels per day from output until March, leading to a shortfall relative to rising demand.

There had been doubts demand would rise sufficiently to exceed global supply, but a report from the International Energy Agency suggests this was marginally the case in the second quarter of this year.

Whether this will remain the case will depend on output from the likes of the US continuing to grow, which is arguably made more likely by rising prices making shale oil drilling more profitable.

Figures last week showed the first decline in the US drilling rig count for six months. Experts will be watching to see if this becomes a trend.

Jacques Rousseau, managing director at Clearview Energy Partners, told CNBC: "What that means is this is Opec's big chance. As long as they can keep oil supply relatively constant, this higher demand is going to draw down inventories."

Low oil price makes North Sea a drain for first time

3 July

A depressed oil price is taking a toll on the UK public finances and has rendered the North Sea offshore oil and gas sector unprofitable for the country for the first time in its history.

The industry received a net £312m in tax rebates for the financial year to the end of March, according to official data. As recently as 2011/2012, it had contributed £10.9bn to the Treasury in tax.

"Figures published a year ago had suggested that tax revenues dipped into the red in 2015/2016," says The Times, "but HMRC has since revised its estimates, making 2016/2017 the first year of negative revenue."

The figures are a blow to the government, which based its economic projections on Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts predicting a net tax-take of £100m last year.

Since peaking in 2011/2012, tax revenues from oil and gas have been in decline as a result of ongoing decommissioning and cleaning up of old oil fields, for which rebates of up to 50 per cent are offered.

The decline accelerated rapidly in late 2014, when oil prices more than halved from well above $100 a barrel. They have not recovered since, despite picking up markedly late last year following a deal to cut production by Opec and other major suppliers including Russia.

Prices last week saw their first gain for six weeks in what has now become an eight-session rally - the longest for five years - on the back of a modest decline in US output. Nevertheless, trading is down 14 per cent for this year.

Brent crude, the international benchmark, was up 0.8 per cent earlier today to $49.20 a barrel after falling as low as $45 in the past two weeks. Its US counterpart West Texas Intermediate was up one per cent at $46.50.

Gains are tempered by worries over global supplies, especially as oil output from Opec unexpectedly rose by 280,000 barrels in June, says Reuters.

"To put that in context, that is nearly a quarter of the 1.2 million barrels [per day] Opec agreed to cut," said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at AxiTrader.

Oil price slowly recovers from ten-month low

29 June

Oil is continuing to endure volatile trading amid conflicting trends and data on global supply.

Both the main benchmarks have risen for six consecutive trading sessions, marking the longest bull run since April, says Reuters.

Brent crude was up 0.8 per cent for the day at $47.69 a barrel, having earlier hit a peak of around $48.20. Last week, it fell significantly below $45.

Its US counterpart, West Texas Intermediate, was up by around 0.8 per cent at $45.10.

Last week, the oil price crashed to a ten-month low and into official "bear market" territory, prompting analysts to warn trying to time the bottom of the market was like trying to "catch a falling knife".

Triggering the latest rise was yesterday's news from the US regulator the Energy Information Administration that crude stocks rose by 100,000 barrels last week.

More crucially, the report revealed that after months of consecutive increases, US domestic oil production declined by around 100,000 barrels.

Prices have been dragged down by rising shale oil production in the country, coupled with a general supply overhang around the world following a two-year output glut.

Even the extension of cuts from Opec, Russia and other oil-producing nations has failed to calm nerves and statistical evidence suggests it has done little to reduce actual oil exports.

Analysts at Commerzbank told Reuters production outages due to Tropical Storm Cindy in the Gulf of Mexico and maintenance in Alaska were responsible for last week's production dip in the US.

"It is thus doubtful whether (the) price rise will really prove lasting," they said.

Goldman Sachs also kept a bearish stance, saying today it has downgraded its forecast for the oil price in the months ahead.

It said: "We expect this will leave prices trading near $45 until there is evidence of a decline in the U.S. horizontal oil rig count, sustained stock draws or additional OPEC production cuts."

Oil price nears seven-month low despite big US reserves drop

22 June

The oil price is hovering near seven-month lows and remains close to being in a "bear market", despite a big fall in reported US oil reserves.

Brent crude, the international oil price benchmark, fell below $46 a barrel yesterday after peaking earlier this year at $56 a barrel. Earlier today, it hit an intraday low below $45, marking a peak-to-trough fall of more than 20 per cent to meet the definition of a bear market.

See related Will Brexit Britain endure an economic recession?

It rallied a little this afternoon and at the time of writing was at $45.35.

Its US counterpart, West Texas Intermediate, has fallen from a low earlier this year above $54 a barrel and it was at the time of writing trading below $43.

Yesterday afternoon, the Energy Information Administration, the US regulator, reported the country's stockpile of crude oil fell last week, its tenth decline in the past 11 weeks. It dropped 2.5 million barrels, says Reuters, above analysts' expectations of 2.1 million.

However, US reserves data is no longer moving the market. Morgan Stanley says global inventories across the OECD, China and various other countries rose by a million barrels in the first quarter.

Moreover, despite pledges from the likes of Opec and Russia to cut out by 1.8 million barrels a day until next March, production is rising in the US as well as some Opec countries exempt from the agreement.

"Nigeria's crude oil exports are set to exceed 2 million barrels per day in August, the highest level planned for 17 months," says Reuters.

Michael Burns, oil and gas partner at law firm Ashurst, said: "This is a pretty concerning time for a lot of producers.

"The question is whether Opec will respond with further cuts or whether it needs to look again at its macro strategy for addressing low prices."

Oil price is 'like a falling knife right now'

21 June

Oil prices fell back into "bear market" territory yesterday and have failed to respond meaningfully to further evidence that US oil reserves are in steady decline.

Traders are reticent to buy back into the commodity when it is "like catching a falling knife", Amrita Sen, of Energy Aspect, told CNBC.

It is a phrase used by traders and experts to refer to situations when a market is in sharp decline and it has become hard to recognise when it has hit a floor, meaning a move to buy back in is likely to result in further pain and losses.

Sen added: "I genuinely haven't seen sentiment this bad ever."

Oil had actually risen markedly after producers including Opec and Russia announced a deal to cut 1.8 million barrels a day from global supplies last November.

International oil price benchmark Brent crude hit a high of more than $56 barrel this year, but yesterday fell to a seven-month low below $46.

Its US counterpart West Texas Intermediate was yesterday at around $43.25 after touching $54.45 this year, says USA Today. That's a peak-to-trough drop of more than 20 per cent, marking a fall into bear market territory.

Trading is being hit by a massive supply overhang and evidence that global supplies still exceed demand, keeping prices under pressure.

While private sector data published yesterday showed US crude reserves fell by 2.7 million barrels last year - which, if confirmed by US regulatory figures today, would mark the tenth fall in 11 weeks - the oil price is unmoved.

In addition, while the Opec deal has been extended, Nigeria and Libya, both exempt from the deal, are increasing production and exports have fallen less than headline output cuts suggest.

US shale oil output is also rising, with new drilling wells rising for 22 consecutive weeks.

"The future might be bright for oil prices but the present is not," said Tamas Varga at London-based broker PVM.

US oil price 'most definitely' heading to $40 a barrel

20 June

The oil price has taken another negative turn, plunging to its lowest level in seven months on signs the market remains in the grip of a global supply glut.

US benchmark West Texas Intermediate was 2.8 per cent down at less than $43 a barrel at time of writing. Brent crude, the international oil price benchmark, was down 2.6 per cent at $45.70 a barrel.

Forecasts for the future are also dire. John Kilduff, founding partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital, told CNBC that oil was "most definitely" heading to $40 a barrel in the near future and will likely dip into the upper $30s.

The story is not much changed from late last week, when prices dropped sharply: traders are responding to news of rising output from key producers and signs of global oil reserves continuing to grow.

Specifically today came the news that production will be up more than 110,000 barrels per day by August in Nigeria and Libya, both of which are exempt from Opec supply cuts.

Exports from Iraq are also said to be increasing, while shipments in general across Opec are thought to have fallen only marginally, despite the 1.8 million barrels per day of cuts that will continue until next March.

Since that reductions deal was renewed in May, the oil price has fallen 15 per cent.

In addition, output is continuing to rise in the US - last Friday, an increase in active shale oil wells was reported for the 22nd consecutive week, says Business Insider.

Morgan Stanley has cited figures that show crude oil inventories rose across the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), China and selected other non-OECD countries by about a million barrels in the first quarter of this year.

"Now we're in the process of the market playing chicken with Opec and non-Opec," Kilduff added. The producers are "going to have to react again in a significant way to get the price to stabilise and go back up."

Keep it in the ground



Join us in urging the world’s two biggest charitable funds to move their money out of fossil fuels

To Bill and Melinda Gates, founders of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Jeremy Farrar and Sir William Castell, director and chair of the Wellcome Trust:

Your organisations have made a huge contribution to human progress and equality by supporting scientific research and development projects. Yet your investments in fossil fuels are putting this progress at great risk, by undermining your long term ambitions.

Climate change poses a real threat to all of us, and it is morally and financially misguided to invest in companies dedicated to finding and burning more oil, gas and coal. Many philanthropic organisations are divesting their endowments from fossil fuels. We ask you to do the same: to commit now to divesting from the top 200 fossil fuel companies within five years and to immediately freeze any new investments in those companies.

The argument for a campaign to divest from the world’s most polluting companies is becoming an overwhelming one, on both moral and financial grounds. As Archbishop Desmond Tutu puts it: “People of conscience need to break their ties with corporations financing the injustice of climate change”.

Note from Alan Rusbridger, editor-in-chief

Divestment serves to delegitimise the business models of companies that are using investors’ money to search for yet more coal, oil and gas that can’t safely be burned. It is a small but crucial step in the economic transition away from a global economy run on fossil fuels.

The usual rule of newspaper campaigns is that you don’t start one unless you know you’re going to win it. This one will almost certainly be won in time: the physics is unarguable. But we are launching our campaign today in the firm belief that it will force the issue now into the boardrooms and inboxes of people who have billions of dollars at their disposal.

What they say

We’re not going to be able to burn it all”

Barack Obama

Frequently asked questions

What is fossil fuel divestment?

Divestment is the opposite of investment – it is the removal of your investment capital from stocks, bonds or funds. The global movement for fossil fuel divestment (sometimes also called disinvestment) is asking institutions to move their money out of oil, coal and gas companies for both moral and financial reasons. These institutions include universities, religious institutions, pension funds, local authorities and charitable foundations.

Evidence shows that proven fossil fuel reserves are more than three times higher than we can afford to burn in order to stay below the generally agreed threshold for dangerous climate change. Fossil fuel companies are currently banking on extracting these reserves and selling them – and are actively prospecting for more. By supporting these companies, investors not only continue to fund unsustainable business models that are bound to make climate change worse, but they also risk their financial assets becoming worthless if international agreements on climate change are met.

The White House and a pair of influential conservative advocacy groups have endorsed a proposal by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) that would allow health insurers to offer cheaper, less-comprehensive plans as long as they also offered at least one plan that includes the essential consumer protections required by the Affordable Care Act. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has sent Cruz's proposal to the Congressional Budget Office for cost-benefit analysis.

Wednesday's endorsement of the Cruz amendment by the leaders of FreedomWorks and the Club for Growth "is significant: Without at least a neutral stance from conservative groups, it could be impossible for McConnell to find the 50 votes needed to pass a repeal this month," Politico reports. "But what the right is asking for may not be able to pass the Senate." The proposal may well violate budget rules that McConnell is using to push through his bill with 51 votes, and more centrist senators and outside insurance experts are concerned that it would essentially price people with pre-existing conditions and other high medical needs out of the insurance market.

"People who have higher health-care needs and need more comprehensive coverage would choose ACA-compliant plans," said Cori Uccello at the American Academy of Actuaries. "People who are healthy now would tend to choose noncompliant plans with really basic benefits. People who want or need more comprehensive coverage could find it out of their reach, because it might become unaffordable." Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who was frequently thanked during July 4 festivities for helping at least slow down the bill, agreed that the Cruz language "would lead to adverse selection in the marketplace," adding: "It would also vitiate the important consumer protection of having a prohibition against annual and lifetime caps" on benefits.

Cruz and his allies argue that the amendment would lower premiums and allow individual consumers to essentially opt out of ObamaCare, but touching the pre-existing condition language may be a deal-breaker for other Republicans. "Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee is speaking against it in caucus lunches and Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska, a staunch conservative, also vocally opposes Lee and Cruz's idea," Politico says. "Many senators believe that the House made a critical error by allowing states to opt out of pre-existing condition protections and are determined not to touch that part of ObamaCare." A Senate vote could come as early as next week. Peter Weber

For those of us who still lament the passing from our television screens of National Lottery psychic Mystic Meg, Theresa May’s super-extended tightrope walk over the issue of the public sector pay cap provides welcome nostalgia.

Teachers, nurses, doctors, paramedics and the rest. They know they’re not really going to get a pay rise, but what’s wrong with a little escapism of a Wednesday lunchtime? For more than a week, government ministers have oscillated between the many layered mysteries of the pay cap being “under active discussion” yet "remaining in place", of balancing "fairness to public sector workers with fairness to those who pay for them".

At Prime Minister’s Questions, Mystic May even came dressed as the part, almost. The dark jacket spreading open from the waist. If only its deep green velvet collar had been risen a foot behind her bobbed haircut like a witch’s cape, a crystal ball on the despatch box, the look would have been complete.

Firefighters, she explained, had just awarded themselves a whopping 2 per cent pay increase, five numbers plus the bonus ball. Now, further pay review bodies are set to report in the coming weeks: “Teachers, prison officers, police officers, senior executives, could be lucky toooooo.”

They won’t be, of course. Not unless Philip Hammond decides that balancing the public books is suddenly no big deal. That as the Brexit negotiations enter their most meaningful phase, there is suddenly extra public cash to splash around. That seems unlikely.

For the entirety of the Prime Minister’s exchanges with Jeremy Corbyn, no other subject was raised.

The Labour leader remains a man renewed, and he had what might have been his most devastating PMQs attack line yet.

“The Prime Minister found £1bn to keep her own job,” he asked. “Why can’t she find the same amount of money to keep nurses and teachers in their job, who after all, serve more than us?”

Rhetorically fine and, even, almost mathematically sound. In recent years, when Jeremy Hunt has vetoed even a 1 per cent pay rise for nurses, he likes to make the point that to do so would cost £500m. So Theresa May’s £1.5bn and counting deal with the DUP, even on Mr Hunt’s maths, could cover a 3 per cent pay rise for nurses.

That’s not a good look. Theresa May had her comebacks, of course. Unfortunately they are as tired and as impotent as she is.

“Labour’s way means more taxes, fewer jobs, and everyone pays the price of Labour!” she thundered, much to the thrilled admiration of her new band of brayers. Stephen Kerr in particular, the new Conservative member for Stirling and former Area Leader in the Church of Latter Day Saints, appeared almost to be speaking in tongues.

She carried on: “Waiting to put up taxes, waiting to destroy jobs, waiting to bankrupt our country. We will never let it happen!”

These lines worked upon a time. But when you’re leading a party who, having stretched their own private neuroses on to the nation at large, and in so doing have taken the economy from the best performing in the G7 to the worst in just 12 months. Well, you’re living on borrowed time, aren’t you?

With a dramatically beautiful Old Town and stylishly modern New Town, it’s little wonder Edinburgh is enticing increasing numbers of visitors each year. In 2010 the city attracted 3.27 million tourists – by 2015 that figure had grown to 3.85 million. Steeped in history amid a dramatic hillscape with the coast just a few miles away, Scotland’s capital is walkable yet densely packed with things to see and do, from medieval buildings to farm-to-table dining. Here are 10 of the best ways to check out everything Edinburgh has to offer.

Taste some whisky

Scotland is famous for many things, but above all its production of the amber nectar. Pop into any of Edinburgh’s many drinking establishments and you’ll find a staggering number of quality whiskies to quaff (Jack Daniels is a dirty word here) and for much cheaper than you’d find in London. Think £3 to £5 per dram, even for premium brands. To learn more about the origins of whisky and how it’s made, plus do a tasting while seeing one of the world’s biggest whisky collections, visit the Scotch Whisky Experience (scotchwhiskyexperience.co.uk). This genuinely enjoyable interactive attraction costs from £15, which includes a crystal tasting glass.

Night at the museum

The National Museum of Scotland (nms.ac.uk) has an eclectic collection of remarkable treasures from around the world. From dinosaurs to design, the museum boasts hundreds of objects spanning thousands of years and originating from countries across the globe. If heading there this summer, kick your visit up a notch with the Museum After Hours: Friday Fringe Takeover sessions. Each Friday night in August, the museum will open its doors from 7.30-10.30pm, featuring handpicked performances from the Fringe taking place in various spaces. The £18 admission fee also includes entry to the museum's Bonnie Prince Charlie and the Jacobites exhibition.

Pick a season

Captivating at any time, Edinburgh is especially winsome in summer and winter. Summer brings with it the world-famous Fringe Festival (edfringe.com), with performances ranging from the mainstream to the far out. This year marks the 70th anniversary of the fringe – it’s now the single biggest celebration of arts and culture in the world. It runs from 4 to 28 August 2017.

Alternatively, choose to stay around Christmas and there’s a whole host of delights that await. During the festive season a huge German market rolls into town next to Princes Street, serving up gluhwein and crafts aplenty, while George Street plays host to the Street of Light, a free event featuring over 60,000 lights that flash in time to live music. Post-25 December the fun really begins with Hogmanay. In Edinburgh, celebrations begin on 30 December with a torchlit procession, escalate on 31 December with a citywide street party complete with DJs, live bands and midnight fireworks, and wind down with the Loony Dook on New Year’s Day – a chance for insane people to don fancy dress and jump into the freezing River Forth.

Climb Arthur’s Seat

It’s something of a rite of passage to scramble up to the highest point in Holyrood Park, known as Arthur’s Seat – it’s a short walk east of the city centre. Once at the very top (250m), visitors are rewarded with spectacular panoramic views across the city and out to the coast. It’s an energetic climb but well within the capabilities of most people (though trainers or hiking boots are recommended). There are various walking routes (geowalks.co.uk/iarthurwalks.html), with the red route being particularly fetching; it’s a circular walk from Holyrood Palace that takes around two hours to complete.

Drink at the Dome

The Dome (thedomeedinburgh.com) is an institution in Edinburgh’s New Town. Although it boasts various tea rooms and restaurants inside, the reason to go is the out-of-this-world Grill Room. The elaborate uplit domed ceiling and circular bar are legendary; tourists wander in to have a good rubber neck at the décor, buying a cocktail as something of an afterthought. Visit around Christmastime and the effect is a particularly outlandish brand of Dickensian meets Disney, with a gargantuan Christmas tree drenched head to toe in fairy lights, and gaudy, bauble-bedecked wreaths everywhere.

The Dome is a sight to behold at Christmas (The Dome)

Eat your fill

Edinburgh has no shortage of wonderful places to eat. Locals’ favourite The Outsider (theoutsiderrestaurant.com) is the perfect place to grab a spot of lunch. Booking is highly recommended for this popular eatery, where the food is ludicrously good value and the views of Edinburgh Castle through the floor to ceiling windows unbeatable. The hand written menu changes regularly, featuring dishes such as pan fried seabass fillet with crispy red pepper polenta, wasabi crushed peas and smoked paprika syrup; a snip at £6.90.

Come dinner-time head to Gardener’s Cottage (thegardenerscottage.co) – a bijoux, rustic restaurant housed in a charming 19th century building, where guests sit on communal wooden benches and eat whatever’s put in front of them by chefs Dale Mailley and Edward Murray. This is a tasting menu-only affair, where for a flat fee of £60 you are served up nine mouth-watering courses based on seasonal ingredients sourced locally.

Get back to nature

It seems a prerequisite for a city to have a botanical garden these days, but Edinburgh’s is a cut above. The Royal Botanic Garden (rbge.org.uk) was first set up in 1670 and boasts over 70 acres of landscaped grounds to explore. There’s a huge amount to see and do – the Scottish Heath Garden is a recreation of the Scottish highlands, the Rock Garden is home to over 5,000 alpine plants and the 165m-long Herbaceous Border is backed by a century-old beech hedge. There are daily tours of the garden, plus 28 glasshouses (the oldest of which was built in 1834) that are teeming with exotic plantlife. And from 29 July to 29 October 2017 a new art exhibition, Plant Scenery of the World, brings together established and emerging artists as part of the Edinburgh Art Festival. Entry to the garden is free, glasshouse admittance costs £6.50.

Art attack

Swing by the Scottish National Gallery (nationalgalleries.org) and the Royal Scottish Academy (royalscottishacademy.org), housed in neighbouring buildings by Waverley Station. The National Gallery is home to masterpieces by Botticelli, Raphael, Titian, Rembrandt, Vermeer, Constable, Turner, Monet, Van Gogh and Gauguin, while the adjoining Academy features a variety of temporary exhibitions. Free admission (although there is a fee for some exhibitions).

Walk the Royal Mile

Edinburgh’s famous Royal Mile refers to the collection of historic, iconic streets at the heart of the Old Town. Start at Holyrood Palace and meander your way along from east to west, taking in the Scottish Parliament building, Canongate Kirk and St Giles’ Cathedral. At the other end of the Royal Mile you’ll find the brooding form of Edinburgh Castle (edinburghcastle.gov.uk). Content yourself with taking some snaps in the large courtyard out front or stump up the £17 to go inside and explore the Great Hall and admire the Stone of Destiny and Scottish crown jewels in all their glory.

Head underground

The Real Mary King’s Close (realmarykingsclose.com) is one of Edinburgh’s odder attractions, but provides a fascinating tour around the city’s warren of old alleyways, now underground. These 17th century tunnels used to be streets where people lived, but have since been completely built over, leaving them intact – just as they were hundreds of years ago. On a one-hour tour led by an actor who stays resolutely in character as a peasant from the 1600s throughout, visitors learn about Edinburgh’s rich and varied history, with a focus on the devastation wreaked by the Black Death. Adult tour costs £14.75.

Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket company has launched its second Falcon 9 rocket in 48 hours, taking another step towards renewable space flight.

The craft was sent into orbit to put up ten Iridium satellites to improve mobile phone coverage.

It was fitted with a "more durable set of grid fins" to stabilise the rocket "as it descends back to Earth", reports ArsTechnica.

Previous fins had "caught fire due to atmospheric heating", adds the site. The new versions "are designed for multiple re-uses as SpaceX seeks to more toward rapid reuse of its first stage booster".

It's a significant development into frequent and reusable space flight. Musk said the updated Falcon 9 "should be capable of an indefinite number of flights with no service".

Incredibly proud of the SpaceX team for achieving this milehttp://www.gettyimages.co.uk/license/691967420stone in space! Next goal is reflight within 24 hours. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) 30 March 2017

The rocket launched on Sunday at the company's Vandenberg Air Force base in California, two days after a Falcon 9 last used in January went into orbit to deploy another batch of satellites, says TechCrunch.

Developing rockets that can be reused for multiple flights could reduce the cost of space travel by around 30 per cent, Gwynne Shotwell, president of SpaceX, told Wired.

The company sent its first used Falcon 9 into orbit in March, when the rocket successfully returned to orbit and landed on a floating platform in the Atlantic Ocean.

Previously, rockets could only be used on one mission as their booster jets and hulls would burn up on re-entry into the atmosphere.

One of the few exceptions was Nasa's space shuttle, although the BBC says "the complexities of servicing the shuttle system after every flight swamped any savings".

Musk's next milestone is to launch two rockets within 24 hours of each other.

Director of the Whitechapel Gallery for the past 15 years, Iwona Blazwick discovered Damien Hirst. As a young curator she gave him his first solo show at a public art gallery, the Institute of Contemporary Arts in St James's, in 1991.

Then as director of exhibitions and displays at the Tate in the late Nineties, she played a vital role in the development of Tate Modern.

Next month, Whitechapel Gallery is curating Art Night, a programme of architecture, art, dance, design and music at sites around east London.

WHERE I LIVE

I live off the Caledonian Road. Islington is up a hill, very urban, has elegant Georgian squares and big old Victorian houses.

It is close to the Heath and, for my husband, near the Arsenal stadium. It's like an enclave away from the city. There was one Islington councillor who stopped any building over three storeys high — he protected that whole area up from City Road to Holloway Road.

We have an 1890s Arts & Crafts house with marble fireplaces, wide stairwells and ceiling cornices.

MY DECOR

I am an inveterate collector but a curator's salary only takes you so far, so I collect editions and works on paper. Every two years I call on a roving band of technicians who hang all the museums and galleries in London.

They're all artists and musicians with an amazing eye and they conserve, frame and clean everything. They come to the house for two days and we re-hang everything.

Most people get blind to what they see on their walls, so it's a way of reinvigorating your environment. You can hang works that resonate with what is happening in the world. And we have converted our attic to a proper art store with cedar wood to keep the moths away.

It's my private heaven.

MOST COVETED OBJECT

I would love to own a Barbara Hepworth. I'm very proud that the Whitechapel gave Hepworth her first show in 1962.

I also really want a Green Light, right, by artist Olafur Eliasson. It's a sustainable LED lamp produced in a collaborative artistic workshop by refugees and visitors.

The lamps can be ordered from greenlightworkshop.org for a minimum donation of $250 (£221).

FAVOURITE GALLERY

Camden Arts Centre. Tony Fretton Architects did the renovation and it's beautifully done. You immediately feel you are leaving the city with the old Arts & Crafts entrance and then there's that beautiful terrazzo space with one of the best independent art bookshops in Britain.

It has a garden and a very nice café. The shows are always original, at a navigable scale, and it's risk-taking.

BEST ARCHITECTURE

Christ Church Spitalfields, of course. And I've just been to see Farshid Moussavi's shop for Victoria Beckham on Dover Street. It is absolutely beautiful… the are interested in graphics, in the book as a work of art, and combining art and language.

And I’ve just been to see Farshid Moussavi’s shop for Victoria Beckham on Dover Street. It is absolutely beautiful… the way she has made the ceiling and these screens with projections on them, it’s really exciting.

I thought, wow, good for her that she took a chance on a relatively young female architect. Big admiration.

FAVOURITE MAKERS

I love artists who work with communities to change their environments, especially in areas abandoned by politicians and developers.

Theaster Gates is an African-American artist who works with White Cube and he has devised what he calls The Soul Manufacturing Corporation, linking art, design and social engagement.

He trained a group of unemployed 16-year-olds, in one of the most deprived areas of Chicago, to recycle old buildings and transform furniture as new pieces. He gave an amazing talk at the V&A about it.

They produce bricks, ceramics, wood- and textile-based objects. And a parallel group is architecture collective Assemble (assemblestudio.co.uk) who work with local communities to regenerate derelict properties.

They are teaching people to have some control over their own destiny. They have just done a project with Transport for London, running ceramics workshops for people at Seven Sisters Tube.

In a digital age we have never been more interested in the tactility of making.

Pitfield Street near Hoxton Square Bookartbookshop is located onStreet nearSquare

SECRET SHOP

Bookartbookshop on Pitfield Street near Hoxton Square is full of small works by artists who are interested in graphics, in the book as a work of art, and combining art and language. You’ll see concrete poetry there and little performances.

CULTURAL HOTSPOT

Go to Herald Street for the most intense concentration of galleries. There's Maureen Paley, right, Herald St gallery, the Campoli Presti gallery and five minutes up the road, the Wilkinson Gallery on Vyner Street.

It's a fantastic little journey and then you can polish it off with a gin and tonic at the Approach Tavern. I love the gallery there and they do barbecues.

FAVOURITE HOMEWARE SHOPS

A friend introduced me to David Mellor's shop in Sloane Square and it's just beautiful. There's real practical kitchenware with that wonderful modernist aesthetic. I've just discovered Jasper Morrison's outlet on Kingsland Road and also The Dark Room on Lamb's Conduit Street.

On Hanwell Street, off Brick Lane, some really nice experimental vintage and homeware shops are opening up — like a new generation of Labour and Wait.

TELL US ABOUT ART NIGHT

This year we're delving into the great architectural masterpieces of the East End with 11 different and sitespecific works.

Our young Turkish curator, Fatos Ustek, is fascinated by the influence of diverse groups coming into the area. So one of the Art Night locations will be one of the great Huguenot houses, Dennis Severs' House, where the Chapman Brothers will insert prints into the existing 18th-century furnishings.

You'll have access to spaces not normally open to the public — for example inside Tower Bridge's Bascule Chamber — the bit where the bridge lifts up — a huge masterpiece of Victorian design and engineering, where Ian Whittlesea will invite audiences to take part in an illuminated meditation.

And for me the most exciting discovery is the fully formed Grade-II listed masonic temple at the Andaz Hotel.

Move means Home Office will not conduct checks on residents or those coming forward to help authorities in fire inquiry

The Home Office has announced a temporary 12-month immigration “amnesty” for survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire.

The immigration minister, Brandon Lewis, told MPs the move was in recognition of the fact that some foreign nationals directly affected by the fire did not wish to engage with the authorities because of their concerns about their unresolved immigration status or because their permission to stay in Britain was about to expire.

The announcement means the Home Office will not conduct checks on residents of Grenfell Tower and Grenfell Walk or those coming forward to provide information to help the authorities in their inquiries.

The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, welcomed the announcement but said the 12-month amnesty did not go far enough.

“I’m pleased to see the government has met the request I raised in the Commons on Monday for an immigration amnesty for Grenfell survivors. Without an immigration amnesty there may well be people we never know about, and too many people who need help who will not receive it,” she said.



“But this does not go far enough to ensure the confidence of those affected. Why would they volunteer their details knowing that in just 12 months they could face deportation? The amnesty must be indefinite to be truly effective.”



Survivors who contact the Home Office will be given up to a year’s temporary leave to remain in Britain outside the immigration rules and with full access to relevant support and assistance. The usual requirement that they demonstrate that they can live without claiming social security benefits or having recourse to other public funds will also be waived. No fees will be charged either.

It is understood that the Home Office has offered the temporary leave to remain status in good faith and does not intend to use it to take subsequent enforcement action when it expires and may actually offer those involved the opportunity to regularise their status in Britain.

The policy will be kept under review and remain in place at least until 31 August.



The immigration minister said: “This period of leave to remain for those directly affected by the fire will provide survivors with the time to deal with the extremely difficult circumstances in which they find themselves and start to rebuild their lives while considering their future options, as well as to assist the police and other authorities with their inquiries about the fire.”

Abbott pressed the case for an immigration amnesty for Grenfell survivors in the Commons on Monday. She said concern about their immigration status was one of the factors preventing people from coming forward, either to obtain the help they need or to provide the information the authorities need.

DUBLIN Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker said on Thursday the Doha-based carrier would soon start buying shares in American Airlines (AAL.O) "depending on the share price."

The state-owned company notified American Airlines last month that it was interested in buying up to 10 percent of its shares.

Al-Baker told reporters in Dublin that Qatar Airways would buy up to 4.75 percent, despite a cool response given last month by the American Airlines CEO to its plan, once it has regulatory approval.

SEOUL South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Thursday dialogue with North Korea was more pressing than ever and a peace treaty to permanently end the Korean War must be signed by all parties to establish lasting peace on the peninsula.

Moon said in a speech in Berlin the North made a disappointing and misguided decision to conduct a test of a ballistic missile on Tuesday and it now faced the last chance to make the right choice.

"We do not wish for the collapse of North Korea and we will not pursue any form of unification by absorbing the other. We will not pursue unification by force," he said.

Moon is in Germany to attend a summit of G20 countries. The two Koreas remain in a technical state of war under an armistice ending the 1950-53 Korean War, signed by the North, the United States and China.

Eating processed foods and indulging in a "sedentary lifestyle" has lead to two billion people around the world being overweight, says high-tech fitness firm Technogym , an Italian company looking to put a spin on the conventional gym in an attempt to lower this figure.

It's already proving to be a popular system, with the company providing equipment to 180 facilities across the world, including several luxury hotels, as well as supplying the fitness equipment for the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. They have also partnered with McLaren Applied Technologies, who are looking to use data-driven exercises to improve the performance of their racing drivers.

To see how Technogym's equipment works and whether it can help non-gym-goers get active, we were given a quick warm-up session on its Skillmill running mill and Skillrow rowing machine.

Later, we'd be put through our paces by McLaren's driver-performance manager, Simon Reynolds, to see how Technogym's Kinesis rig helps drivers cope with the physical exertions of an F1 car.

Fitness fans bored of the usual gym machines will find a lot to interest them in Technogym's range, but the gadgets will also appeal to less-active tech geeks.

For instance, the Skillmill running machine has a QR code on it so users can see how well - or not - they're doing by scanning it and using the company's Mywellness app. The same can be done on the Skillrow, which can also track arm and leg power individually.

Both machines are fitted with dials so you can change your workout to suit. Turning the dial to its lowest setting is almost too easy, but the mid-range of the scale has a more natural feel. This is more noticeable on the Skillrow, which simulates the effects of moving through water.

The highest setting is brutal, no matter how fit you are.

However, it's incredibly satisfying to see your performance relayed to you in real time through the app, especially for those who like having a visual target to keep them motivated.

Following a short workout on both machines, Reynolds put us through a quick F1-style workout on Technogym's Kinesis rig, which looks intimidating and confusing at first, but is remarkably simple and intuitive to use.

Reynolds has trained the likes of Stoffel Vandoorne and McLaren junior Nyck DeVries and tells us they have to build their arm muscles to deal with the weight of their car's steering wheel at high speeds.

The Kinesis rig helps this by working the muscles around the shoulders and arms using weights attached to cables. Reynolds gets us to lift the weights and bring our arms forward to mimic a steering wheel. It's a challenging exercise that highlights how much force drivers have to apply to the wheel.

Technogym's tracking systems let McLaren monitor the performance of their drivers and target weak areas that need improving.

This is what sets the company apart, as it gives users the data they need to see how they can improve.

It’s heartening that the Conservative Party is trying to work out what mistakes it made, and several of their MPs have suggested they should adopt some of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaigning methods, especially in attracting youth.

So to start with, Conservative members should gather in groups at rock festivals and sing “Oooooh, Andrea Leadsom”, and see if it catches on.

Then they could start their own support from the grime rap scene, the way Labour did in its sneaky way. They could make films in which DJ Michael Fallon struts round a housing estate, rapping, “Hey my crew’s strong and stable/And swear down bruv I’m able/To press a button to enable/Mass destruction at da table/Not like Corbyn or dat wasteman Vince boy Cable”, and see how long it took before it went viral.

They should find a way of attracting the youth in the way Corbyn has, because I expect it’s only the way Labour puts stuff on YouTube and Twitter that won young people to Labour’s cause. The ideas, such as abolishing tuition fees didn’t make much difference. If the Tories could make something shiny and sung by Stormzy, I’m sure they could get people to support policies such as taking away your house to pay for your dementia care.

Jeremy Corbyn : Grenfell Tower has exposed the disastrous effect of austerity

It’s possible there are bigger changes taking place. For example, the British Social Attitudes survey this week revealed 48 per cent now support higher taxes to pay for services. But this probably doesn’t mean anything.

The problem the Conservatives have is it wasn’t just Labour that got 40 per cent of the vote, it was Labour with policies and a leader that, everyone had agreed, made them completely unelectable. For two years there were columns every day that went “Labour would LITERALLY have more chance if they were led by the Devil, and he started his conference speech ‘I don’t just want their votes, I want their SOULS, MWAHAHAHA’ and sacrificed a virgin as a symbol of the plans to take the east coast railway line back into public ownership.” And that would be a joint statement from the shadow Cabinet.

Some Conservatives such as Toby Young urged his supporters to register as a Labour member and vote for Corbyn, as this would ensure the Tories stayed in power FOREVER.

To be fair, this confirms a unique talent of Toby Young, to manage to be wrong about everything, all the time, which is really tricky. If he backed both horses in a two-horse race, it would end with the commentator shouting: “Oh my goodness, a stray guinea pig has come through the middle and beaten them both.”

But it suggests few of them appreciate the scale of the change taking place. Cutting taxes is no longer popular, screaming that someone once met someone in the IRA no longer makes an impact.

Murdoch helped destroy Kinnock, Brown and Miliband, but couldn’t touch Corbyn who he hates more than anyone. The Daily Mail sees its causes wilt every day, and soon they’ll be so full of anguish and rage their headlines will just be “HnnnnyeaAAAAAGH – AAAAAAGH, eeeeeyEAGGGGGGGRRRRAAAGH”, and they’ll win a huge following amongst thrash metal fans, who will sing the front page thinking it’s the lyrics to a song called “Axe Through the Skull”.

What was considered extreme a few weeks ago now seems mainstream. For example, there’s the reaction to the atrocious fire. Conservative politicians and columnists expressed outrage at Corbyn and John McDonnell’s comments, who blamed cost-cutting for the disaster.

They claimed this was an attempt to “politicise” the tragedy, and they may have a point, because the fact the fire happened in a block occupied by working-class people, following years of cuts in health and safety and council budgets was probably just a coincidence, and an identical fire must be just as likely in Donald Trump’s tower.

Also it can’t be fair to jump to the conclusion that the deadly cladding was chosen because it was cheaper. There could be many reasons why the contractors picked that sort, maybe it was all they had left at B&Q.

It would also be bad form to suggest there was a culture of hostility towards health and safety. When David Cameron announced in 2012 that health and safety culture was part of a “sea of red tape, a restrictive monster”, he meant in a nice way.

Years of Tories screaming, “Health and safety, health and sodding pissing scummy poxy safety, how can business build anything if they’ve got to worry about health and stinking rancid useless pointless arsehole safety?”, didn’t suggest they were in any way hostile to health and safety.

Until recently the Labour Party would have shied away from making these claims. But now it’s accepted as reasonable for Labour to make their case, and even the demand to rehouse survivors in homes left empty by the wealthy, has to some extent been agreed.

In any case, if a group of residents wants to ensure sufficient money is spent on their tower block, all they have to do is uproot it and move it to Belfast.

Because the Democratic Unionist Party seem to have been given a few bob, as the Conservative slogan appears to be “WHERE’S THE MAGIC MONEY TREE? Come on then, if you want to spend all this money, WHERE’S THE MAGIC MONEY TREE? AY? COME ON YOU IDIOTS, WHERE IS IT? WHERE? AY? WHERE? Oh, hang on, here it is.”

The biggest and most obvious financial impact for regular Brits since the UK voted to leave the EU last June has been the huge drop in the value of the pound against virtually every other major currency around the world.

Sterling witnessed the largest single intraday drop against the dollar in its history the morning after the vote and continued to drop for several months afterward.

Those months were filled with wild swings in value, a flash crash and a shift from being driven by economic data releases, to moving on political developments, especially those related to Brexit.

Britain's currency now appears to be recovering to some extent and is threatening to break above 1.30 against the dollar for the first time since September last year. However, what happens to sterling in the future — with hurdles like Brexit and the upcoming general election clouding the picture — is anybody's guess.

To find out what might happen to the pound, Business Insider rounded up forecasts from banks, economic research houses, and trading firms about which way they think sterling is headed over the medium-term.

Most have recently increased their forecasts, largely on the assumption that Theresa May's Conservative Party will win an increased majority at June's election, paving the way for her to take a more conciliatory stance on Brexit, and move away from the sort of Brexit favoured by hardline Conservative MPs, who currently have a disproportionate influence on policy thanks to the party's slim majority.

However, many have raised forecasts from a very low baseline, and as a result, still expect the pound to end 2017 lower than it is currently trading.

Check out the forecasts of economists, analysts, and strategists below (all forecasts are for the pound against the dollar unless otherwise specified):

Daniel Morris, Senior Investment Strategist at BNP Paribas Investment Partners

(BNP Paribas Investment Partners)

Forecast: Stronger by the end of 2017, no precise forecast

What they say: "The likely electoral impact on Sterling depends on whether an increased Conservative majority (as the polls expect) leads to a 'harder' or 'softer' Brexit. The argument for a softer Brexit (which supposedly explains Sterling’s initial rise following the announcement of the election) is that with a larger majority, the Prime Minister will have greater flexibility to negotiate an agreement with Brussels that avoids the potentially more negative aspects of leaving the EU, with subsequent Parliamentary approval and freedom from the constraints of the hard Brexiteers," Morris said in analysis sent to Business Insider.

"The counter narrative - it is worth noting that sterling has given up its initial post-election announcement gains against the euro, even though it has held up against the dollar - is that newly-elected MPs are more likely to support a hard Brexit, thereby increasing the likelihood of Britain reaching such an agreement. We think that a hard Brexit was already priced into the markets, and for the time being the prospect of a softer Brexit will drive the currency higher, unless the economic data weakens decisively. That weakness may be appearing, given that first quarter GDP data came in below expectations. So even if negotiations move in Britain’s favour, the economy might not cooperate."

Chris Turner, Head of Foreign Exchange Strategy at ING

Forecast: $1.35, revised upwards from previous $1.27 forecast.

What they say: "Positioning data since then [May calling a general election] — which covers trading activity to the week ending 25 April — shows only a modest reduction in speculative GBP shorts. That suggests speculators continue to hold GBP short position, built at a time when Cable was trading under 1.25. We think it would not take too much to force more aggressive short-covering — sending GBP/$ to the 1.32/1.34 region in the run up to the 8 June election."

"Should the Conservatives manage to secure a 100+ majority on 8 June, we would expect GBP to enjoy a modest bounce = largely on the view Theresa May would be able to marginalise the more ardent Brexiteers in her party," Turner said in a note on May 3.

Samuel Tombs, Pantheon Macroeconomics

Forecast: $1.25 by the end of the second quarter, but appreciation afterwards.

What they say: "Currency traders have judged that Prime Minister May will win a huge majority in the general election on June 8, loosening the grip of hardline Brexiteers on her negotiating position. Investors also have judged that the chances of an orderly transition deal with the E.U. have increased," Tombs wrote on May 2.

"The next election now will not need to be held until 2022, rather than 2020, alleviating the pressure on Theresa May to show that Brexit has been delivered in full immediately.

"We do not find these arguments compelling. It equally can be argued that a larger majority will reduce the influence of the minority of pro-EU Conservative MPs on the Government."

"Accordingly, we think that sterling's rally could go into reverse in the short-term, and we still forecast a $1.25 level for sterling at the end of Q2. Further ahead, however, we continue to see scope for sterling to appreciate. The U.K. public's zeal for Brexit likely will decline, persuading the Government to make as many compromises as required in order to maintain as much access to the single market as possible."

Pantheon is currently updating its currency forecasts, and this post will be updated once we have its new figures.

Danielle Haralambous, UK Analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit

(Economist Intelligence Unit)

Forecast: Stronger by the end of 2017, no precise forecast

What they say: "It's clear from the reaction in foreign-exchange markets that the general election presents upside risks for the pound. The Conservative Party is riding high in the polls and will secure a larger majority parliament, giving Theresa May more freedom to implement her domestic policy agenda, and the Brexit that she favours," Haralambous told BI over email.

"The prime minister has committed to taking the UK out of the single market—but a bigger majority would mean that Mrs May would no longer be hostage to Brexiteer backbenchers holding her to account on the terms of the final deal. The pound may reverse some of its recent gains as the economy slows in 2017-18, but to the extent that the general election will deliver greater political stability, we expect to pound to be firmer this year than we previously assumed."

Sheena Shah, Morgan Stanley

Forecast: $1.45 by the end of 2018.

What they say: On the day Theresa May called for a general election in May, Morgan Stanley's Sheena Shah said in a research note: "Stabilisation of GBP has already started, which should aid inflows into the currency. Notably, FX reserve managers have started to move out of the EUR and into GBP. Our estimations suggest the market has priced in a lot of the negativity associated with Brexit, with today’s developments starting to reverse some of that pricing. The risk to our view is a large undershoot of UK growth data in coming months."

Roger Hallam, Chief Investment Officer, Currencies at JPMorgan Asset Management

​Forecast: Sterling to drop against the dollar and euro by the end of 2017

What they say: Hallam told BI: "We believe that the upcoming UK general election will allow the Prime Minister to consolidate and grow her majority, while providing better scope for transitional arrangements so that the probability of a ‘cliff’ exit becomes lower –which reduces the severe tail-risks for Sterling.

"But assuming the UK pursues a reasonably hard Brexit approach, the period will certainly be challenging from an economic and capital flows perspective. Our shorter-term view of a bounce in GBP/USD towards 1.30, based on the general election triggering a short-covering move in Sterling, has now largely been realized. The months ahead should see the Federal Reserve raise rates in June and September and the ECB upgrade its outlook on the economy paving the way for it to announce a tapering of its QE purchases in September. The Euro should also benefit from strong equity inflows into the region as investors adjust their asset allocations to benefit from an improving earnings outlook in the Eurozone. Meanwhile the onset of the Brexit negotiations in June should highlight the challenge the UK faces in leaving the EU and we believe the Bank of England is likely to leave rates unchanged this year.

"Overall, this leaves us biased towards higher levels of Euro and US dollar vs Sterling for balance of this year."

Martin Beck at Oxford Economics

Forecast: "Sterling to reach perhaps $1.35 by the end of this year," Oxford's Martin Beck told BI.

What they say: "Fundamentally, sterling is cheap. That may mean little to investors given the widespread perceptions that leaving the EU will entail a major regime change. Our house view is that Brexit will eventually lead to a permanent loss of output equivalent to 3% of GDP by 2030. That scenario may warrant a lower equilibrium level of sterling. In our judgment, that unknown new level is not 15%-20% lower than fundamental anchors. Our view is that up to 10% upside in sterling is a reasonable medium-term expectation, especially relative to the dollar," a note from Beck at the end of March said.

Alan Ruskin and George Saravelos, Deutsche Bank

Deutsche Bank's headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany (Getty)

Forecast: Sterling to fall to $1.20 by the end of 2017. Until recently Deutsche Bank was the most bearish mainstream sterling forecaster, predicting a drop to as low as $1.05.

What they say: Writing on May 4, Deutsche Bank said: "The recent announcement of a snap UK general election has materially improved the chances of the UK securing a transitional deal with the EU27. Assuming our base case of a large Conservative majority is correct, the influence of hard Brexit MPs will be reduced and the hard deadline of the May 2020 general election is extended by two years. Accordingly, we have revised the GBP/USD cycle end-point nine big figures higher from its previous low of 1.06. This returns it to levels after the Brexit vote but before PM May’s ‘hard Brexit’ Birmingham Party Conference Speech, reflecting a reduced risk of the UK crashing out of the EU in March 2019 with no arrangements.

"The need for market pressure to force compromise between the UK and EU has reduced, but this isn’t enough to turn bullish sterling in the medium term. Politics will cease to be the only dominant driver of sterling and fundamentals will matter more. These are far from bullish."

​Kamal Sharma, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

(Getty Images)

Forecast: $1.27 by the end of 2017, up from a previous forecast of $1.19.

What they say: "The announcement of an 8th June General Election was a game changing event for GBP. We have consequently revised our GBP forecasts which mainly impact the front-end of the profile, no longer expecting the one final dip. Our end-2018 GBP/USD takes us closer to our estimates for fair value than previously," Sharma wrote early in May.

"GBP will likely trade at a structurally lower equilibrium level and GBP/USD is unlikely to regain its pre-Referendum range. A slowing domestic economy tempers prospects of sustained upside."

Pierre-Olivier ​Gourinchas, director of the Clausen Center for International Business and Policy at the University of California, Berkeley and Galina Hale, a research advisor at the San Francisco Fed

Forecast: Lower for longer.

What they say: "Despite a possible boost to manufacturing exports and some valuation gains, the depreciation of the pound since the Brexit vote must reflect expectations of slower growth for the U.K. economy in the next few years and beyond," the pair argued in a recent paper for the San Francisco Federal Reserve.

"While some groups may gain from Brexit, the message from the foreign exchange and asset markets is clear: The overall size of the economy will eventually shrink relative to what it could have been if the United Kingdom had voted to stay in the EU."

A former chef who claimed he accidentally smothered a girlfriend in his sleep has been found guilty of killing two women after a campaign for justice by one of the victim’s families.

Robert Trigg, 52, told an inquest that he had rolled on to Susan Nicholson in 2011 as they slept on a sofa together, five years after he killed another partner, Caroline Devlin, 35, in her bed.

Both women’s deaths at their homes in Worthing, West Sussex, were recorded as non-suspicious despite his history of domestic abuse going back two decades. Trigg was brought to justice after Ms Nicholson’s family refused to believe his claim that he had accidentally suffocated her.

He was convicted yesterday after a ten-day trial of Ms Nicholson’s murder and…
