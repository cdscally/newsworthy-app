CLAIM

12 barrels containing human remains were found buried on the property of Bill and Hillary Clinton in June 2017.

FALSE

RATING

FALSE

ORIGIN

On 21 June 2017, the “satirical” web site Freedom Crossroads reported that 12 barrels containing human remains had been found on property owned by Bill and Hillary Clinton in upstate New York.

After the body parts of three women were found last night in a barrel unearthed from the garden area of the Clinton Estate in upstate New York, ground penetrating radar was brought in to analyze the entire property. Within a few hours, eleven more possible sites were pinpointed and excavation began. By dawn, 11 more identical steel 55-gallon drums were awaiting transport to Quantico with an immaculate chain of evidence. They will arrive and be opened later today.

The article, like everything published by Freedom Crossroads, is entirely fabricated. Buried at the bottom of its homepage, the web site includes a disclaimer:

We believe that there is nothing more precious than the mind of an aging conservative. Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate. Reality is often in the eye of the beholder. You won’t find any of it here.

This didn’t prevent the World Truth web site from republishing the story in earnest, along with the same photo of a barrel, which actually originates with a project undertaken by the Applied Geophysics Center at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

On the same day, similar versions of the fake story were also published by the News Feed Hunter web site (which added invented details such as the names of victims) and the Red Politics web site, which claimed three of the bodies found were those of three young women who disappeared while hitchhiking in 1974.

On its web site, Red Politics warns readers:

Sometimes the articles are satires and fake and we cannot make any warranties about the completeness, reliability and accuracy of this information.

The June 2017 “buried barrels” story is the latest distasteful chapter in a long saga of deaths and disappearances falsely attributed to or associated with the Clintons over the past few decades.

Iceland issued a travel ban against white Southern Baptists.

FALSE

RATING

FALSE

ORIGIN

On 6 June 2017, the web site Patheos published a satirical article saying that Iceland had issued a travel ban preventing white Southern Baptists from visiting the country:

This secular island country situated in the North Atlantic passed a law yesterday preventing white Southern Baptists from entering the country.Officials state that the United States of America is a country in turmoil and Southern Baptists are the ones mostly responsible. Atheist Iceland considers itself to be taking a stand for human rights by not tolerating foreign nationals who seek to undermine democracy.

Patheos largely focuses on religion and spirituality, but it also has a non-religious section that includes humor pieces. The particular piece was published in the Laughing in Disbelief section and linked to a disclaimer stating that the content was satirical:

CLAIM

An investigation has proven the presence of feces in Starbucks beverages.

FALSE

RATING

FALSE

ORIGIN

On 28 June 2017, the BBC teased an upcoming episode of their program Watchdog, an investigative series into consumer-related issues, with some scary-sounding revelations about coffee shops:

Ice from three of the UK’s biggest coffee chains has been found to contain bacteria from faeces, according to a BBC investigation. Samples of iced drinks from Costa Coffee, Starbucks and Caffe Nero contained varying levels of the bacteria, the BBC’s Watchdog found. […] At both Starbucks and Caffe Nero, three out of 10 samples tested contained the bacteria known as faecal coliforms.

The news, unlike the bacteria that inspired it, went viral nearly immediately. Some people took this BBC report as evidence of a widespread feces problem in Starbucks coffee. Others somehow interpreted this finding as an indictment of Starbucks’s alleged liberal politics. Bizarrely, some purveyors of vitriol tried to connect the report both to Muslims and to Starbucks’s pledge to hire refugees.

Importantly, however, what Watchdog found was not actually feces or fecal matter, but an extremely broad class of bacteria in 30 percent of the ten samples they took from a single Starbucks in the UK.

If you are looking to promote a television show with a viral story, a tried and true method is to perform the test Watchdog used — a fecal coliform assay — on everyday objects. This same approach convinced the internet that beards were poop-infested sanitation risks back in 2015. In response to that fecal hysteria, the Washington Post’s Rachel Feltman had this calming response:

The problem with this is that bacteria known to associate with poop is not necessarily literal poop. In fact it’s probably not. And saying that something is gross for being covered in bacteria is pretty ridiculous, because anything that exists in our physical realm is definitely going to be covered in bacteria. I have bad news for y’all: You’re covered in poo bacteria. COVERED. Look to your left, look to your right. There’s probably poo bacteria on both sides and also in front of you. It’s okay. It’s really fine. Embrace the poo bacteria, it is a part of you because you are a multitude of microorganisms, each more special than the last.

These words were just as relevant to beards then as they are to Starbucks ice cubes now. Indeed, the bacteria identified by a fecal coliform assay is not specific to feces, as a 2006 editorial published by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) pointed out in a piece arguing against using the test as a sole indicator of fecal matter:

Historically, the definition of fecal coliforms has been based on methods used for their detection. […] Several genera of bacteria [identified by a fecal coliform assay] are common contaminants of non-fecal sources (e.g., plant materials and pulp or paper mill effluents). Examples include Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Citrobacter species. Moreover, these bacteria which are false-positive indicators of fecal contamination can grow under appropriate conditions in nonfecal niches such as water, food, and waste.

In fact, the only bacteria included in the test that is exclusively found in feces is E. Coli., which the BBC’s Watchdog did not mention identifying (the ASM argues any fecal coliform test should be confirmed with a specific E. Coli test if one wants to demonstrate the presence of feces).

The expert the BBC quoted to heighten the fear of Starbucks ice was Tony Lewis, the Head of Policy for the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, which is described as “a campaigning organisation [that aims] to promote improvements in environmental and public health policy.” While the brief excerpts of him included in the BBC segment sound alarming, his full comments are a bit more reassuring:

It is important that those of us who enjoy our coffee and particular our iced drinks during the summer, do not panic. The issues identified in this case came from an extremely small sample and we have no reason to suspect that these findings will be the same everywhere.

Far from being definitive proof of poop in your Starbucks iced coffee, this “investigation” is more of a how-to on how to make a vague finding sensational in the lead up to a television episode.

On 6 June 2017, President Donald Trump posted a series of tweets that targeted the Gulf nation of Qatar amid an ongoing diplomatic crisis with neighboring countries — including Saudi Arabia, which Trump had recently visited:

So good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off. They said they would take a hard line on funding… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6, 2017

…extremism, and all reference was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6, 2017



The crisis started in late May 2017, when Qatar’s state-run news agency QNA posted remarks attributed to emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani that praised Iran and Israel and disparaged Trump. Shortly afterward, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with the country. The government of Qatar released a statement saying that QNA had been hacked, and that the statement by Al Thani wasn’t authentic:

The Qatar News Agency (QNA) website has been hacked by an unknown entity. A false statement attributed to His Highness has been published.

CNN reported on 6 June 2017 that Russian hackers attacked Qatar’s state news agency and produced the artificial statement:

US investigators believe Russian hackers breached Qatar’s state news agency and planted a fake news report that contributed to a crisis among the US’ closest Gulf allies, according to US officials briefed on the investigation. The FBI recently sent a team of investigators to Doha to help the Qatari government investigate the alleged hacking incident, Qatari and US government officials say.

Although Russian hackers have been accused of interfering with the 2016 U.S. election and the French election in 2017, Malcolm Nance, an intelligence expert and former counterterrorism officer with the United States government, told us the current Gulf crisis appears to have roots that stretch back beyond the “fake news” that appeared on QNA’s web site, pointing to hacked e-mails between officials from conservative think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) and the Emirates ambassador to the U.S., Yousef Al-Otaiba. Nance told us:

I don’t believe this came from [fake news] and if anyone’s saying that, it’s a convenient way to say, “now we have a reason to defuse this crisis.” I think Donald Trump gave away the game with his two tweets where he said he was part of the planning at this Saudi conference.

The hacked e-mails show a campaign to isolate Qatar by Al-Otaiba, an influential figure in Washington, D.C. Some of the e-mails were obtained by the Huffington Post, which reported:

Otaiba, one of the most powerful diplomats in Washington, figures in an unfolding regional crisis centered on U.S. partner nation Qatar, which hosts America’s largest military base in the region. The UAE and three other U.S.-aligned Middle East governments ratcheted up a simmering dispute with Qatar on Sunday night when they cut diplomatic and transportation ties to the Gulf nation over its support of the transnational Muslim Brotherhood and alleged assistance to Iran-backed militants around the region. … The leaked emails, which show Otaiba’s comments during a yearlong campaign to discredit Qatar in the U.S., threaten the UAE’s hope to win official American blessing for its pressure campaign against the Qataris. Trump is notoriously thin-skinned: He has banned people who publicly criticized him from his team (including GOP consigliere Elliott Abrams, a fellow Qatar skeptic who is friends with Otaiba) and seems unable to get over slights even years after they occur. And his administration already seems disinclined to pick a side. Top officials like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis have emphasized the importance of resolving the dispute.

Amid the tensions and maneuvering, the Financial Times reported it was a $1 billion ransom payment by the Qatari government in April 2017 to militant groups to free members of the royal family who had been apprehended on a hunting trip in Iraq, which ended up being the catalyst to the current falling out:

The deal, which was concluded in April, heightened concerns among Qatar’s neighbours about the small gas-rich state’s role in a region plagued by conflict and bitter rivalries. And on Monday, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain took the extraordinary step of cutting off diplomatic ties and transport links to Qatar, alleging the country fuels extremism and terrorism.

Nance said the risk of Trump’s decision to pick sides in the fight is that Qatar could potentially ask the U.S. — which has Al Udeid Air Base and 11,000 military personnel in the country — to leave.

German lawmakers voted Friday to legalize same-sex marriage, a move widely supported across the country that brings Germany in line with many of its Western peers. Chancellor Angela Merkel voted against the measure, but paved the way for its passage by allowing members of her conservative party to vote according to their conscience.

Lawmakers voted 393-226 to legalize “marriage for everybody,” with four abstentions. Underlining the delicate political tightrope that Merkel walked, the “no” votes came entirely from her conservative bloc, although some prominent party members, including Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen and her chief of staff Peter Altmaier, voted for it.

“This is a historic day,” said Greens lawmaker Volker Beck, who leapt to his feet to applaud once the result was announced and was showered with confetti by supporters.

“It is really an amazing victory,” said Beck, who has campaigned around Europe for gay rights.

Gay couples outside the chancellery, not far from parliament, kissed and hugged after the decision was announced, waving rainbow flags and carrying signs saying “Marriage for everybody.”

“We’ve been happily married for eight years, but we could never call it that,” said 38-year-old Shoshana Brandt, standing alongside her partner and their son. “We are happy and proud that we are now equal and we can live our love.”

After years of lukewarm opposition to gay marriage following her party’s line, Merkel said Monday that lawmakers could take up the issue as a question of “conscience,” allowing members of her conservative coalition to individually vote for it if they wanted.

That prompted her center-left rivals to call for a quick vote on the issue, adding it to the agenda Friday on parliament’s last regular session before Germany’s Sept. 24 national election.

Berlin Christian Democrat Jan-Marco Luczak, one of 75 lawmakers from Merkel’s bloc who voted for the measure, urged his fellow party members to join him.

“It would be absurd to try and protect marriage by preventing people to marry,” he told lawmakers in the debate ahead of the vote.

Many applauded Merkel’s comments that opened the way for the vote, but Social Democrat lawmaker Johannes Kahrs noted that the chancellor has been a longtime opponent of gay marriage.

“Many thanks for nothing,” he said bluntly.

Germany has allowed same-sex couples to enter civil partnerships since 2001, but has not granted them full marital rights, which include the possibility of jointly adopting children, even though gay marriage enjoyed some 80 percent support, according to recent polls.

More than a dozen countries in Europe have legalized gay marriage, all in the western part of the continent, and Germany had been the largest where it was not yet legal. Almost a dozen others have some sort of same-sex unions or civil partnerships, according to the Pew Research Center.

Amnesty International praised the law as a “victory for equality.”

“Germany has become the 23rd country to recognize same-sex marriage and has sent a clear message to the world that gay and lesbian people should be entitled to the same rights as everyone else, and to full and equal protection of the law,” Amnesty’s Europe director John Dalhuisen said.

The new law won’t take effect for several months because it still needs to pass the upper house of parliament and be approved by the president, although those are formalities. It is also expected to face legal challenges.

Merkel told reporters later that her vote against the measure was based upon her reading of the country’s law concerning marriage but added that she did think gay couples should be able to adopt.

Germany’s constitution is vague, saying only that “marriage and the family shall enjoy the protection of the state,” but Merkel said that for her, “marriage as defined by the law is the marriage of a man and a woman.” Still, she urged all views to be respected.

“It was a long, intensive, and for many also an emotional discussion. That goes for me personally too. And I’m hopeful not only that there will be respect for either side’s opinions, but that it will also bring about more peace and cohesion in society,” she said.

All of Merkel’s potential coalition partners after the September election, including the center-left Social Democrats of her challenger, Martin Schulz, have been calling for same-sex marriage to be legalized.

Analysts have suggested that by opening the door to gay marriage, Merkel removed yet another issue that her opponents could have used against her in an election year — a nod to her pragmatic approach to politics.

In her nearly 12 years as chancellor, Merkel has moved her party to the center and away from conservative orthodoxy, speeding up Germany’s exit from nuclear power and ending military conscription, among other moves.

A high-profile legal battle by the parents of 10-month-old Charlie Gard appears to have come to an end. On 27 June, a European Court refused to intervene in the case, which saw the High Court of England and Wales rule that the infant — who suffers from an extremely rare mitochondrial disease — should be taken off life support and die in hospital.

According to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, where Gard is a patient, the boy suffers from infantile-onset encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (also known as MDDS). He has severe brain damage and progressive muscular weakness, and cannot move or breathe unaided. He cannot hear or see, and is unlikely to be able to develop either ability.

As a result, doctors at Great Ormond Street believe it is in his own best interest to receive palliative care, rather than keep him on life support and in March 2017, they applied to the High Court of England and Wales for permission to withdraw life support.

At present, there is no established effective cure for MDDS, and doctors at the hospital therefore regard the condition as terminal. However, Charlie’s parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates from Bedfont, West London, have raised $1.7 million (£1.3 million) for experimental nucleoside treatment in the United States.

The treatment has never been tried before on humans, and the American doctor who expressed a willingness to treat Charlie told the High Court “…It is very unlikely that he will improve with that therapy.”

In April 2017, the High Court ruled that it was in Charlie’s best interest for life support to be ended. Having heard expert testimony from several witnesses, Justice Nicholas Francis wrote in his judgement:

The prospect of the nucleoside treatment having any benefit is as close to zero as makes no difference. In other words, as I have already said, it is futile.

Justice Francis concluded:

As the Judge whose sad duty it is to have to make this decision, I know that this is the darkest day for Charlie’s parents who have done everything that they possibly can for him and my heart goes out to them as I know does the heart of every person who has listened to this tragic case during the course of the past week or so. I can only hope that in time they will come to accept that the only course now in Charlie’s best interests is to let him slip away peacefully and not put him through more pain and suffering.

Charlie’s parents appealed the ruling unsuccessfully several times — first with the Court of Appeals of England and Wales, then with the United Kingdom Supreme Court. Finally, the couple took the case to the European Court of Human Rights, arguing (among other points) that Charlie’s right to life was being violated.

However, the court in Strasbourg, France, ultimately ruled that the imperative to act in Charlie’s best interests and not prolong his suffering outweighed the vanishingly small likelihood of successful treatment. On 27 June, Charlie’s parents’ application was ruled inadmissible and rejected.

In a 29 June 2017 video message, Charlie’s mother, Connie Yates, claimed that the couple had expressed a longstanding wish to bring him home to die in the event that he was denied treatment, but that Great Ormond Street Hospital would not allow them to do so. She said the infant was likely to be taken off life support and die in the hospital the following day.

We’ve been talking with Great Ormond Street since November last year – when they first started talking about court – about what palliative care meant, and we had three options: one option was to let Charlie go in hospital; the other option was to let Charlie go to a hospice; and the third option was to let Charlie go home to die. So we chose to take Charlie home to die and we have said this for months, that that is what we want. That is our last wish, if it went this way, the way it’s gone. And we promised our little boy, every single day, that we would take him home, because that is a promise we thought we could keep.

Chris Gard, Charlie’s father, added that after the European Court of Human Rights decision, the couple reiterated to the hospital their wish to bring Charlie home to die or to take him to a hospice if that was not possible. Both preferences were rejected by the hospital, according to Gard.

They said no to both. He has to die in that hospital tomorrow [30 June 2017].

The boy’s parents also claimed that the hospital refused their request to delay removing life support until members of their extended family can pay a final visit to Charlie. Connie Yates claimed: “We’ve literally begged them today to give us this weekend.”

Chris Gard added:

Some of our family and friends can’t come. They can’t come before tomorrow. So the last time they saw Charlie will be the last time they ever see him.

When we contacted Great Ormond Street Hospital for a response to these allegations, a spokesperson said in a statement:

Together with Charlie’s parents we are putting plans in place for his care, and to give them more time together as a family.

According to the BBC, Connie Yates previously stated that if she and her partner were not allowed to take Charlie to the U.S. for the experimental treatment, they would put the money donated to them by members of the public toward helping other children with mitochondrial disease.

“If Charlie doesn’t get this chance, we will make sure that other innocent babies and children will be saved,” she reportedly said in a GoFundMe post that has since been deleted.

President Donald Trump crowned his weekend rage against the news media with a mock video that shows him pummeling a man in a business suit — his face obscured by the CNN logo — outside a wrestling ring.

It was not immediately clear who produced the brief video, which appears to be a doctored version of Trump’s 2007 appearance on World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. The 28-second clip was posted on Trump’s official Twitter account Sunday morning, with the message: “#FraudNewsCNN #FNN.”

Trump, who has branded the media as the “opposition party” and CNN as “fake news,” stayed on the attack later in the day, stating on Twitter that “the dishonest media will NEVER keep us from accomplishing our objectives on behalf of our GREAT AMERICAN PEOPLE!”

On Monday, he continued the attacks on Twitter: “At some point the Fake News will be forced to discuss our great jobs numbers, strong economy, success with ISIS, the border & so much else!”

At some point the Fake News will be forced to discuss our great jobs numbers, strong economy, success with ISIS, the border & so much else! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2017

Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, condemned the video as a “threat of physical violence against journalists.” He said Trump’s tweet was “beneath the office of the presidency.”

A White House aide insisted the tweet should not send a chill across the media landscape.

“I think that no one would perceive that as a threat,” homeland security adviser Tom Bossert said. “I hope they don’t. But I do think that he’s beaten up in a way on cable platforms that he has a right to respond to.”

CNN accused Trump of engaging in “juvenile behavior far below the dignity of his office.”

White House officials traveling with Trump during his weekend stay at his New Jersey golf club did not immediately respond to questions about the video. It appeared to be a doctored version of an appearance Trump made on a World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. show called “Battle of the Billionaires” in 2007, in which Trump appears to attack WWE CEO Vince McMahon.

McMahon’s wife, Linda, who founded and built the company with her husband, now heads the Small Business Administration for Trump and was a donor to his campaign.

The video was posted several days ago by a Reddit user with the title, “Trump takes down fake news.” It was not clear whether that was where it originated or how Trump found it. Still, the user wrote Sunday about being “honored” Trump had tweeted the video. The user who posted the video has a history of posts using anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant language.

The president’s verbal shots against news outlets and individual members of the media have grown increasingly personal in recent days even as lawmakers in both parties say the insults only threaten to undermine his political agenda.

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is defending his use of a beach closed to the public during New Jersey’s government shutdown, saying he had previously announced his vacation plans and the media had simply “caught a politician keeping his word.”

The Republican governor was photographed Sunday by NJ.com at Island Beach State Park sitting on a beach chair in sandals and a T-shirt before flying to talk to reporters in Trenton.

Christie told WTXF-TV in Philadelphia on Monday that he had earlier said he planned to be at the state-owned governor’s beach house regardless of whether there was a shutdown.

He said the media “caught a politician keeping his word” and added New Jersey “has beaches for 120 miles” so there are plenty of options for anyone wanting a beach day as the Fourth of July approaches.

New Jersey’s budget stalemate between Republican Gov. Chris Christie and the Democrat-controlled Legislature is smoldering with the state government shut down and state parks closed to the public as the Fourth of July approaches.

Christie said he’d sign any budget lawmakers sent to him and blamed the shutdown of nonessential services on Democratic Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto.

Christie said he’d consider the Democratic budget along with legislation to overhaul the state’s biggest health insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield. He said without the Horizon legislation he has called for he’d line item veto $350 million of the Democratic priorities.

Prieto is holding open a deadlocked vote on the Assembly floor on the $34.7 billion budget.

At least twenty states have signaled resistance or rejected a request from President Donald Trump’s administration for data for every registered voter in the U.S.

The request was submitted via letters to all secretary of state offices in the nation and the District of Columbia by the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity on 29 June 2017, seeking information that includes the names, party affiliations, addresses, military statuses and the last four digits of the voters’ Social Security numbers, as well as voting history from 2006 onward.

Kris Kobach, the commission’s vice-chair and current Kansas secretary of state, has claimed in the past, as has Trump, that U.S. voter fraud is widespread — but without providing evidence. Trump signed an executive order creating the commission in May 2017, which quickly spurred accusations that it would be used to implement, rather than investigate, voter suppression.

Ten states — California, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Virginia — have fully rebuked Kobach’s call for voter data, including an invitation from Mississippi Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann in a statement of his own:

They can go jump in the Gulf of Mexico and Mississippi is a great State to launch from. Mississippi residents should celebrate Independence Day and our State’s right to protect the privacy of our citizens by conducting our own electoral processes.

Even Kobach’s home state of Kansas balked, prompting backtracking from his office:

“In Kansas, the Social Security number is not publicly available. … Every state receives the same letter, but we’re not asking for it if it’s not publicly available,” Kobach said. He did not rule out the possibility of providing that information to the commission in the future. “If the commission decides that they would like to receive Social Security numbers to a secure site in order to remove false positives, then we would have to double check and make sure Kansas law permits,” Kobach said. “I know for a fact that this information would be secured and maintained confidentially,” he added in response to security concerns.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) made reference to the allegations that led Trump to create the commission in a statement:

New York refuses to perpetuate the myth voter fraud played a role in our election. We will not be complying with this request and I encourage the Election Commission to work on issues of vital importance to voters, including ballot access, rather than focus on debunked theories of voter fraud.

Several other states have responded by saying that they will only share information that is already publicly available.

Voter advocacy groups have also come out against the commission’s push for access to the data, which it said it wanted by 14 July 2017. League of Women Voters president Chris Carson said in a statement that her group would support any state that refused to comply with Kobach’s request:

There is no justification for this giant fishing expedition. The Commission itself is a distraction from the real issue of voter suppression, and that efforts to “investigate voter fraud” threaten our most fundamental voting rights. This most recent move by Mr. Kobach is an indicator that the so-called Election “Integrity” Commission is not interested in facts, but false accusations and dangerous policy recommendations.

The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law also condemned Kobach’s letters and called on his counterparts in other states to “discourage state and local officials” from participating in the commission’s activities:

This meritless inquisition opens the door for a misguided and ill-advised Commission to take steps to target and harass voters and could lead to purging of the voter rolls.

Kobach has not elaborated on how information collected by the commission would be kept safe.

Before joining Trump’s administration, Kobach worked as an attorney for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a hardline anti-immigration group. In September 2016, a federal appeals court found that Kobach had provided “precious little” evidence that non-U.S. citizens were engaging in voter fraud.

CLAIM

Germany's Black Forest caused 15,000 missing person cases last year.

FALSE

RATING

FALSE

ORIGIN

A photograph purportedly showing Germany’s Black Forest is frequently circulated on social media along with the claim that the wooded area “caused” 15,000 missing persons cases last year:



There are a number problems with this meme.

For one, a forest can’t “cause” a person to go missing. This phrasing likely derives from the Black Forest’s reputation as a haunted area (in large part due to its association with the Brothers Grimm fairy tales).

The earliest posting of the meme we found was from August 2014, on CreepyPasta, a Facebook page that specializes in spooky (albeit fictional) short stories. The page describes itself as “a series of fictional and non-fictional stories that are posted on the Internet and are designed to unnerve and shock the reader.”

Furthermore, the image displayed with the claim doesn’t actually show the storied forest. The Black Forest, or Schwarzwald, is in southwestern Germany. But this photograph shows Hameln, Germany, which is in the center of the country.

The Black Forest is outlined in green on the map (left) and the city of Hameln is marked in red (right).

Jonathan Manshack took the photograph, which National Geographic chose as the Photo of the Day on 11 June 2011:

This photo was taken during autumn in Hameln, Germany, which is the birthplace of the infamous Rattenfänger—or Pied Piper, as we Americans know it. This shot is actually on top of the last few hills that soon sink into the state of Niedersachsen (Lower Saxony). This area is essentially lowland plains—hence the name Lower Saxony!

There’s also no basis for the claim that 15,000 people went missing in 2013 — or any other year — in the Black Forest.Germany’s Initiative on Missing Children did not mention the forest as an area of particular concern, nor the The European Child Rescue Alert and Police Network on Missing Children.

15,000 is such an astronomically high number that the meme is clearly inaccurate. To give you an idea, The Bundeskriminalamt, Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office, in its report on missing persons, said that a total of 6,400 people were missing in Germany in 2007 — and that number included cases that were as many as 30 years old.

If the meme were true, that would mean that almost three times as many people had gone missing in one small area of the country in 2013, an event that would warrant both major media coverage and a large-scale criminal investigation. We found evidence of neither.

NEW YORK (AP) — A doctor who used to work at a Bronx hospital returned with a rifle hidden under his white lab coat and opened fire Friday, killing one person and wounding six others before apparently taking his own life, authorities said.

The gunfire broke out at 2:50 p.m. inside the Bronx Lebanon Hospital, drawing police cars and firetrucks to the scene and sending officers onto the roof with their guns drawn as people inside the building were told to hide.

Officers went floor by floor looking for the gunman and reported just before 4 p.m. that the shooter was dead inside the building. A law enforcement official told The Associated Press that the gunman apparently killed himself.

He was identified by law enforcement officials as Dr. Henry Bello, a family medicine physician at the hospital. It was not immediately clear why he was no longer working at the hospital. The officials were not authorized to discuss the still-unfolding investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Emergency crews had been kept from going inside the hospital while the shooter was at large.

Garry Trimble said his wife, hospital employee Denise Brown, called him from inside the hospital shortly after 3 p.m.

“She woke me up and told me there was a situation, somebody’s out there shooting people,” Trimble said as he waited for his wife to come out. “I could hear in her voice she was shaking and about to cry.”

Gonzalo Carazo described the scary scene to WCBS-TV. “I saw one of the doctors and he had a gunshot wound to his hand,” Carazo said.

“All I heard was a doctor saying, “Help, help!” Carazo locked himself in a room for about 15 minutes until police came and led him out of the hospital.

The 120-year-old hospital has nearly 1,000 beds and one of the busiest emergency rooms in New York City. It is about a mile and a half north of Yankee Stadium.

In 2011, two people were shot at Bronx Lebanon in what police said was a gang-related attack.

CLAIM

A fisherman captured a 3,000 lb. great white shark in the Great Lakes.

FALSE

RATING

FALSE

ORIGIN

On 20 June 2016, the web site World News Daily Report (WNDR) published an article reporting that a fisherman made an astounding catch, pulling a a 3,000-lb. great white shark out of the waters of Lake Michigan:

The capture of a 3,000-pound great white shark in Lake Michigan yesterday could explain the disappearance of hundreds of missing people in the region in the last decade, has confirmed the U.S. Coast Guard this morning. John O’Keefe, a Canadian tourist, captured the 3,000-pound beast while fishing for sturgeon in Michigan Lake. “We reeled in the beast for a good 4-5 hours before we finally shot it and wounded it to the head” explains the Toronto resident on vacation. “Luckily, I had my rifle in hand, or else this prize fish would’ve never been caught” claims his friend, a long-time resident of Chicago, Allan Brooks.

The article also suggested that the Great Lakes shark was suspected in a number of unexplained disappearances, incidents that supposedly went unreported by the media because they might adversely impact tourism:

Authorities suspect that more than a hundred people reported missing in the area in the last decade may have fallen under the fangs of the gigantic beast, several local residents even suspecting its presence for a long time. “I’ve owned this campground for the past seventeen years” explains local entrepreneur, Robert Helm. “I’ve had my load of visitors disappearing mysteriously over the years, but I was told not to say anything about it. People would check in, but they wouldn’t check out,” he recalls. “Nobody ever believed me anyway and it would’ve scared away the tourists,” he told local reporters. “It would’ve been bad for business in town” he adds, visibly relieved since the capture of the large creature.

However, this report was nothing more than another fabricated story from a fake news web site.

Great white sharks cannot swim in freshwater lakes, and the image used by World News Daily Report to illustrate their fabrication dates to at least 2013 (and thus is clearly unconnected to any shark capture occurring in June 2016).

World News Daily Report creates fake, outlandish stories published alongside unrelated photographs, racking up ad revenue via social media shares. The site’s disclaimer clearly states that WNDR‘s articles are “satirical” and “fictional”:

CLAIM

The body of a homeless man found in San Diego has been identified as that of Elvis Presley.

FALSE

RATING

FALSE

ORIGIN

On 31 January 2015, the Empire News web site published an article reporting that the body of a homeless man discovered in San Diego had been found through DNA testing to be that of singer Elvis Presley:

Earlier this month, an 80-year-old, homeless, white-bearded man was found deceased under an overpass in San Diego, California. Nobody knew the man’s name, but friends referred to him as Jessie, so investigators decided to try DNA testing with hopes that something would pop up in the nationwide DNA database. What popped up on the computer screen in the high-tech lab stunned everyone. The DNA results of ‘Jessie Doe’ were an exact match to the one and only, Elvis Aaron Presley. Lab technician Robert Brensdale said he and his lab assistant, Madeline Hedgespeth, laughed when the name popped up. “We thought somebody, somewhere, somehow in the system pulled the greatest and most elaborate prank on us ever, we both laughed with hysteria for about an hour,” Brensdale told Jerry Hardin of the Hollywood Word, a new entertainment publication based out of Los Angeles.

Soon afterwards links and excerpts referencing this article were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered the item mistaking it for a genuine news article. However, the report was just a spoof of the ubiquitous “Elvis is alive” and “Elvis faked his death” rumors that have circulated ever since the singer passed away in August 1977, accompanied by an artificial rendering of what an elderly Elvis might look like.

The spoof was published by the Empire News, a fake news web site that issues fictional stories such as “Cure for Cancer Discovered; ‘Amazingly Simple’ Says Researcher,” and “College Student Excused from Classes After Dog Eats Grandmother,” and “Woman Gives Birth, Confuses Doctors by Asking for Maternity Test.”

The site’s disclaimer notes that “Empire News is intended for entertainment purposes only.”

CLAIM

A new analysis of the residue on common American foods showed high levels of the herbicide glyphosate and Monsanto, the EPA, and the FDA are in cahoots to silence word of the chemical’s harmful effects and its high concentration in foods. See Example(s)

EXAMPLES

FALSE

RATING

FALSE

ORIGIN

On 15 November 2016, the natural food evangelist and alternative health guru known as the Food Babe posted a report from a natural food activist group named Food Democracy Now that alleged to demonstrate common American foods contain high levels of glyphosate, a chemical in Monsanto’s RoundUp herbicide and the most prevalent weed-killer on the planet.

Her post and the report it highlights are a new addition to contentious political debate about the chemical’s harm to humans and the environment, as well as the potential influence of large companies like Monsanto on regulatory agencies, that has been ongoing for decades.

Glyphosate is widely applied to crops around the world — especially genetically modified crops specifically bred to be resistant to the chemical, per the National Pesticide Information Center:

Glyphosate is an herbicide. It is applied to the leaves of plants to kill both broadleaf plants and grasses. The sodium salt form of glyphosate is used to regulate plant growth and ripen fruit. Glyphosate was first registered for use in the U.S. in 1974. Glyphosate is one of the most widely used herbicides in the United States. People apply it in agriculture and forestry, on lawns and gardens, and for weeds in industrial areas. Some products containing glyphosate control aquatic plants.

Regulatory agencies have gone back and forth on its safety ever since it was registered for use. The idea, which has been verified by observations, is that glyphosate runs off into the water supply, where it can be ingested directly, or consumed after it leaves a residue on food.

The first assessment of glyphosate’s carcinogenic potential was undertaken by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 1985. Based on studies done primarily with rodents, they classified the chemical as “a Group C (Possibly Carcinogenic to Humans: Agents with limited animal evidence and little or no human data) carcinogen” in 1986. After a series of additional investigations, which included industry sponsored studies, the EPA reclassified the chemical in 1993 as “Group E carcinogen (signifies evidence of non-carcinogenicity in humans).”

A majority of the data used to demonstrate evidence of harm comes from studies in which environmentally unrealistic concentrations of glyphosate were exposed to rats, mice, and fish. Some recent studies have demonstrated potentially adverse effects at low exposure levels but the validity of these results have been called into question by other researchers.

Although a March 2015 review by the WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer suggested glyphosate may have some carcinogenic potential, the current consensus amongst the world’s regulatory agencies is that it is safe for consumption and non-carcinogenic at environmentally relevant levels, with the WHO concluding:

Glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through the diet.

Still, a 2014 report from the US Government Accountability Office compelled the FDA to set up an initiative to monitor food for glyphosate residue, a decision met by praise by environmentalists and food activists. As reported by the Huffington Post’s Carey Gillam, however, the effort was halted due to a lack of agreement on standardizing the analyses:

The FDA’s residue testing for glyphosate was combined with a broader herbicides analysis program the FDA set in motion in February of this year. But the glyphosate testing has been particularly challenging for the FDA. The agency was finally forced to put the glyphosate residue testing part of the work plan on hold amid confusion, disagreement and difficulties with establishing a standard methodology to use across the agency’s multiple U.S. laboratories, according to FDA sources. Equipment issues have also been a problem, with some labs citing a need for more sensitive instruments, sources within FDA said.

This is where the Food Babe’s unsubstantiated narrative comes into the picture. Based primarily on the fact that the FDA canceled its residue testing program, along with results from various studies performed on animals, she alleges a nefarious connection between the FDA and Monsanto, the developer of the RoundUp:

When it comes to the FDA, they are not protecting the American public from glyphosate either. After announcing in February that they would FINALLY begin testing foods for glyphosate residues, they just decided to suspend their testing this week. Could it be that Monsanto didn’t like the results they started getting – especially since the FDA found glyphosate in foods that should be especially safe like BABY FOOD? Monsanto will do whatever it takes to keep that story out of the public eye.

While there are conflicts of interest arguments to be made about the use of industry sponsored studies or petitions to influence regulators, there is no evidence to suggest the FDA halted its testing program in response to pressure from Monsanto.

Instead of providing evidence of the alleged connection, the Food Babe presented the results of non-peer reviewed lab tests performed on various food items at the behest of the activist group Food Democracy Now and the research platform The Detox Project, alleging it exposed high levels of the herbicide on common foods:

A FDA-registered food safety laboratory tested iconic American food for residues of the weed killer glyphosate (aka Monsanto’s Roundup) and found ALARMING amounts. Just to give you an idea of how outrageous these amounts are, independent research shows that probable harm to human health begins at really low levels of exposure – at only 0.1 ppb of glyphosate. Many foods were found to have over 1,000 times this amount! Well above what regulators throughout the world consider “safe”.

The statement about 0.1 ppb being the lower limit for harm to human health is controversial, as only one of the studies listed as providing support for that claim actually tested an amount that low; the test was performed on mice, not humans, and it used the word “potential”, not “probable”.

It is also important to note that many of the results they reported are actually marked with the note that they “may not represent an accurate representation of the sample.”

The lab results commissioned by Food Democracy Now claimed to show residue values on common American foods that were well above 0.1 ppb; but the methods employed are not elucidated, and its important to remember that the FDA limit is four orders of magnitude greater than the threshold they claim.

A final point to note is that the report was commissioned by two groups with a stated agenda, as declared in its introduction:

The testing and analysis was performed at the request of FOOD DEMOCRACY NOW!, in coordination with THE DETOX PROJECT, which gathered additional scientific evidence from around the world and included a compendium of independent research on glyphosate.

According to their website, “Food Democracy Now! is a grassroots community dedicated to building a sustainable food system that protects our natural environment, sustains farmers and nourishes families.”

The Detox Project is a research initiative that is currently focused specifically on glyphosate, according to their mission statement:

Glyphosate, the world’s most used herbicide, is the first chemical being tested by The Detox Project. We aim to study all of the most common man-made chemicals in our environment over the next few years […] to protect women and children from the harmful effects of man-made chemicals in our food and in our environment.

There is no evidence to suggest the FDA shut down its residue program due to complaints from Monsanto. While scientists and regulators have and continue to debate methods for assessing and testing potential harm from glyphosate, the broad scientific consensus is that it is not a risk; and the un-reviewed results of a questionable laboratory exercise do not change that assessment.

An angry Italy summoned Austria’s ambassador after the government in Vienna announced it was ready to re-introduce border controls and deploy troops and armored vehicles along the border to block any migrant influx out of Italy. Austrian Defence Minister Hans Peter Doskozil told Kronen Zeitung daily that troops could go to the Brenner Pass and that four Pandur armoured personnel carriers had been sent to the Tyrol region with 750 troops were on standby.

“We need to prepare for the migration development in Italy, and I expect very promptly that border controls will have to be activated and assistance requested,” Hans Peter Doskozil told the online edition of the Krone daily, adding that a military deployment at the busy Alpine pass would be “indispensable if the influx into Italy [across the Mediterranean] does not diminish”. While Austria has border checks with Hungary and Slovenia, elsewhere – such as on the border with Italy – it adheres to the EU open borders system.

Doskozil explained that “these are not battle tanks. These are armored vehicles without weapons which could block roads. These were already used during the refugee crisis 201/16 at the Spielfeld border crossing [with Slovenia],” just in case Italy got the impression that its northern neighbor was preparing to invade.

The border controls will include the Alpine Brenner pass, which forms the border between Austria and Italy, one of the main mountain passes in the eastern Alps. There isn’t a strict time plan for the step-up in border security, but, according to Doskozil’s spokesman, “we see how the situation in Italy is becoming more acute and we have to be prepared to avoid a situation comparable to summer 2015” according to Reuters.

Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz said that Vienna is prepared to “protect” the frontier with Italy “if necessary,” as he spoke with the Austria Press Agency. Later Italy’s foreign ministry said it had summoned Austrian Ambassador Rene Pollitzer “following the Austrian government’s statement about deploying troops to the Brenner (pass)”.

The latest turmoil inside Europe’s customs union comes two years after Germany admitted over a million mostly Syrian migrants, as part of Angela Merkel’s “Open Door” (since shut) welcome, and just days after Italy’s interior minister demanded other EU nations “step up” and relieve Italy of the sudden flood of inbound migrants.

The Italian governor of South Tyrol, Arno Kompatscher, sought to defuse tensions. According to BBC, he said Austria had issued similar warnings about the border previously, and the situation there remained “quiet and stable”. Austria was gearing up for a general election in October, Mr Kompatscher noted. The anti-immigration Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) is expected to poll strongly.

People-smuggling gangs have been exploiting the violence and chaos in Libya. The shortest crossing from Libya to Italy is only about 460km (290 miles). Nearly 85,000 migrants and refugees arrived in Italy in the first half of this year, across the Mediterranean. The UN refugee agency UNHCR says that is about 20% more than in the first half of 2016.

To be sure, the UN joined Italy’s appeal, with Vincent Cochetel, the UNHCR’S special envoy for the central Mediterranean, saying that “this is not sustainable. We need to have other countries joining Italy and sharing that responsibility.” So far, nobody in the European “Union” has stepped up to “share the responsibility” of Europe’s generous refugee acceptance program.

The latest report by the UNHCR, revealed another troubling statistics: few of the migrants coming to Europe will granted asylum: 30% of them are fleeing conflict or persecution, while 70% of those arriving in Italy are economic migrants. Most migrants and refugees are young, single men with little or no education, and almost 15% are unaccompanied minors.

Meanwhile, Italy has also warned that the current scale of migrant arrivals is unsustainable and that it could even close its ports and impound aid agencies’ rescue ships. In other words, yet another refugee crisis in Europe is imminent.

It will be the second time this has happened in two years. In 2015, the EU’s Schengen system, or the free movement across most European borders, was overwhelmed by an influx of migrants and refugees, whoe reached Central Europe via the Balkans, and most sought asylum in Germany. Since then, tighter border controls in the Balkans have reduced the numbers heading north from Greece. Most of the influx to Austria was via Hungary. Many of those who came by train or on foot were refugees from Syria, Iraq and other conflict zones.

So far 101,000 migrants have entered Europe in 2017 via the Mediterranean and according to the latest figures, 2,247 people have died or are missing at sea.

EU antitrust regulators are weighing another record fine against Google over its Android mobile operating system and have set up a panel of experts to give a second opinion on the case, two people familiar with the matter said.

Assuming the panel agrees with the initial case team’s conclusions, it could pave the way for the European Commission to issue a decision against Alphabet’s (GOOGL.O) Google by the end of the year.

The Commission in April last year charged Google with using its dominant Android mobile operating system to shut out rivals following a complaint by lobby group FairSearch, U.S.-based ad-blocking and privacy firm Disconnect Inc, Portuguese apps store Aptoide and Russia’s Yandex (YNDX.O).

The move by the EU competition authority, which hit the company with a 2.4 billion euro ($2.7 billion) penalty for unfairly favoring its shopping service last month, could pose a bigger risk for the world’s most popular internet search engine because of Android’s huge growth potential.

In the coming days, Iraqi counterterrorism forces are expected to assault the remaining ISIS stronghold in Tal Afar—roughly 40 miles west of Mosul—according to the commander of Iraq’s Joint Military Operations, Lieutenant General Abdel Amir Rashid Yarallah, who spoke to Iraqi media July 4.

“Tal Afar is the next point of liberation with the participation of all military units,” Yarallah said.

“The Turkmen-dominated city of Tal Afar is completely encircled by Turkmen Shia militia and Peshmerga forces,” the leader of the 10,000-man Turkmen Shia Popular Mobilization Forces told Free Beacon Sunday. Abu Retha al Najjar, who directs 2,500 fighters engaged in Tal Afar said that the Tal Afar has approximately 900 ISIS fighters left, of which 650 are local and 250 are foreign fighters. “The district of Tal Afar once held 350,000 Turkmen residents, including Shia and Sunni families, but only 30,000 civilians still live there, chiefly in the town of Maria,” Najjar said.

“Whether the next fight against ISIS is in Tal Afar, Al-Hawija, or Al-Qaim, the coalition will continue to support our Iraqi partners to defeat our common enemy,” said Col. Ryan Dillon, spokesman for the Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR), speaking to defense reporters Thursday.

An Obamacare program awarded hospitals thousands of dollars in bonuses even if they had low-quality scores, according to a reportfrom the Government Accountability Office.

The Hospital Value-Based Purchasing program, which was created by Obamacare, was designed to incentivize participating hospitals to increase efficiency and quality.

Even though the program’s purpose is to reward hospitals that offer high-quality care at a lower cost, the auditors found that hospitals with low quality scores but high efficiency scores still received bonuses.

In fiscal year 2017, there were 345 hospitals that received a bonus with quality scores below the median. Roughly 20 percent of hospitals that received a bonus had a quality score below the median from 2015 through 2017.

The of numbers of individuals in different states on food stamps have dropped precipitously after certain counties in different states decided to re-establish work requirements for food stamp government benefits that ballooned under the Obama administration, Fox News reported Tuesday.

A 2009 congressional economic stimulus package did away with previous work requirements in the states for able-bodied adults and the rolls of those on food stamps spiked to 48 million people across the country by 2013. Preliminary figures for Fiscal Year 2017 show that the number of recipients on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is in a downward trend.

Other ways are being explored to cut the number of SNAP recipients.

After re-instituting the work requirement in 21 more counties in Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported a 62 percent drop in SNAP participants.

San Antonio Police Chief William McManus appeared on “Fox and Friends” Wednesday to discuss anti-police rhetoric after NYPD officer Miosotis Familia was gunned down while sitting in her patrol car.

NBC New York said the shooter was a 34-year-old ex-convict from the Bronx named Alexander Bonds.

The gunman who ambushed and shot an NYPD officer sitting inside her mobile command vehicle Wednesday morning, killing her, was a 34-year-old ex-convict out on parole for robbery, officials say. A motive in the shooting is still not clear, but Alexander Bonds of the Bronx, who also went by the name John Bonds, once ranted online about his treatment in prison and about police getting away with killing people. He had also expressed an anti-government sentiment in online posts, according to a law enforcement official.

San Antonio’s Chief McManus recently dealt with a similar situation to the shooting of Familia when two of his officers were shot at an event he described as “the most unprovoked attack I have ever seen.”

McManus said, “I’m angry at the police haters, I’m sick of the police haters. We protect them. We defend them. And they give us a big F U. And I’m sick of it.”

France has announced its intentions to make 11 vaccines mandatory for children in the face of record low confidence in its population that vaccines can be trusted.

The French website The Local reports that in a parliamentary address on Tuesday, France’s Prime Minister Edouard Philippe declared the government’s plan to implement the mandatory requirements, adding eight vaccines to the mandatory list that already included the vaccines for polio, tetanus and diphtheria.

The move is supported in France’s medical community as a pathway to ensure that immunity remains at acceptable levels in the face of an alarming resurgence in diseases that were all but eliminated a decade ago. According to Santé publique France, a governmental public health monitoring agency in France, measles has been of of these resurgent diseases, with more than 24,000 cases since 2008 which led to 34 cases in neurological complications and 10 deaths.

In a letter from 200 doctors supporting this measure, the importance of protecting the vulnerable was emphasized. The group’s endorsement was in part motivated “because vaccination is not only a personal choice with benefits only for the person vaccinated but aims to protect the population, especially children, the elderly or frail.”

65% of Trump supporters would back a military strike on North Korea, according to a new poll.

The Twitter poll, which received almost 30,000 votes, asked “If Trump launched a military strike on North Korea, would you support it?”

Just 35% of respondents said they would oppose military action.

The numbers that would back a military strike seem significantly higher than those who supported aggression against Syria following April’s cruise missile strike, an event that split Trump’s base.

During a speech in front of the United Nations, Ambassador Nikki Haley warned that sanctions wouldn’t be enough to stop Kim Jong-Un’s dictatorship and that the U.S. was prepared to use “our considerable military forces”.

“Time is short. Action is required. The world is on notice,” she said.

According to the Pentagon, North Korea’s July 4 missile launch was a new type “we have not seen before”.

Most authorities on the issue agree that Pyongyang launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching Alaska, but not the U.S. mainland.

After the launch, North Korea claimed it was, “a full-fledged nuclear power that has been possessed of the most powerful inter-continental ballistic rocket capable of hitting any part of the world”.

North Korea test launched Tuesday an intercontinental ballistic missile that may be capable of reaching Alaska.

The projectile, known as the Hwasong-14, was said to have reached an altitude of 2,802 kilometers (1,741 miles) before flying 933 kilometers (579 miles).

The launch is being described by experts as a “game-changer” that further limits the already scant and risky options available to the Trump administration for dealing with Pyongyang.

According to the Korean Central News Agency, North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un described the ICBM as “a gift” to “American bastards.” The news agency also claimed the missile is capable of carrying a “large, heavy nuclear warhead.”

The United Nations Security Council is expected to issue a stern condemnation of the launch after an emergency meeting scheduled Wednesday.

South Korea and the United States responded to the ICBM test by conducting a joint ballistic-missile drill of its own.

The following images were released by North Korean media outlet Rodong Sinmun:

“South Park” creator Trey Parker says his subversive show won’t feature too many Trump-themed gags in its upcoming season, a deliberate effort to avoid becoming a cable news show disguised as an animated comedy.

Parker told the Los Angeles Times that he never intended “South Park,” now entering its 20th year, to be a show that obsesses over every political controversy of the moment, which today usually involves the president’s latest tweet.

“We did start to become that, though, especially the last season,” he said. “We fell into the same trap that “Saturday Night Live” fell into, where it was like, ‘Dude, we’re just becoming CNN now.’ We’re becoming, ‘Tune in to see what we’re going to say about Trump.’ Matt [co-creator Matt Stone] and I hated it but we got stuck in it somehow.”

“South Park” has earned legions of fans — and the distinction of being the second-longest running animated series in TV history — by skewering the sacred cows of both the progressive left and the family-values right. Over years of taking on, among other sensitive topics, Christianity, Islam, gay rights, illegal immigration, and transgenderism, the show has become perhaps the foremost political satire in popular culture. (RELATED: ‘South Park’ Mocks Black Lives Matter, Colin Kaepernick In Season Opener)

But Parker says “South Park” has always been, at heart, a show about bored, small-town kids getting into mischief. He intends to return to that dynamic this year.

“This season I want to get back to Cartman dressing up like a robot and [screwing] with Butters, because to me that’s the bread and butter of “South Park”: kids being kids and being ridiculous and outrageous but not ‘did you see what Trump did last night?’” Parker told the L.A. Times.

“Because I don’t give a … anymore,” he added.

Trump’s freewheeling, combative political style and daily Twitter outbursts make him an appealing target for “South Park,” but the show’s iconoclastic creators are content to leave jokes about the president to someone else.

“We probably could put up billboards — “Look what we’re going to do to Trump next week!” — and get crazy ratings,” Parker said.

“But I just don’t care.”

Migrants from Central American countries are increasingly choosing to resettle in Mexico as the Trump administration’s tough immigration enforcement policies make the U.S. a less accessible destination.

For years, Mexico has largely been a waypoint for people from the so-called Northern Triangle countries — Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador — who were trying to cross into the U.S. and petition for asylum. As the U.S. has cracked down on illegal immigration at the border and tightened its rules on accepting asylum claims, those migrants are now staying put in Mexico.

As a result, Mexico’s refugee applications have risen dramatically over the last three years, reports the Associated Press. It received 3,424 applications for refugee status in 2015, and the number more than doubled to 8,794 the next year. Mexico is on track to receive even more refugee applications in 2017 — there were 5,464 applications from just January to May.

Migration experts say word of tougher immigration and asylum policies in the U.S. has made its way back to Central America, causing migrants to choose Mexico or other neighboring countries instead. Maureen Meyer, a senior associate for Mexico at the Washington Office on Latin America, says potential immigrants now realize that Mexico is a safer bet for asylum claims.

“If you look at Mexico’s definition of who can qualify for asylum, it’s much broader than the United States,” Meyer told the AP. “If you are fleeing widespread violence in your country, you may be able to qualify for asylum in Mexico, whereas in the U.S. you have to prove that you belong to very specific groups of people.”

Mexico granted refugee status to about one of every three applicants from the Northern Triangle in 2016, reports the AP. The U.S., on the other hand, denies about 80 percent of asylum claims by people from those countries, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.

Under the Obama administration, migration from the Northern Triangle to the U.S. reached unprecedented levels. In 2013, as many as 2.7 million people born in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras were living in the United States, according to a report from the Council on Foreign Relations. That was up from an estimated 1.5 million people in 2000.

Between October 2013 and July 2015, more 100,000 unaccompanied minors from the Northern Triangle arrived in the U.S. and were given expedited resettlement under an emergency Obama order to deal with the surge.

The Trump administration has taken a much less permissive stance, pressuring Mexico to accept more Central American immigrants while publicly discouraging people from making the trek northward.

“We have asked them [Northern Triangle countries] to ask their citizens to not waste the money and head north, do not get on that terribly dangerous network,” Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly told the Senate in June. “Stay where they are, because if they come here, this is no longer an illegal-alien-friendly environment.”

A California judge has dismissed a case that alleged Facebook tracks users even once they have logged out of their Facebook accounts.

The Guardian reports that a case alleging that social media giant Facebook was tracking its user’s browsing habits despite being logged out of their Facebook accounts has been dismissed by the judge presiding over the case. The plaintiffs in the case claimed that through the use of “like” buttons, which appear on many websites across the internet, Facebook was tracking their user’s browsing habits and building detailed reports, an act which the plaintiffs argued violated federal and state privacy and wiretapping laws.

The case was dismissed by US District Judge Edward Davila of San Jose, California who stated that the plaintiffs in the case had not proven that they had a reasonable expectation of privacy or had suffered any realistic economic harm or loss due to Facebook’s actions. Davila said that the plaintiffs failed to prove that Facebook had in fact spied on them and had failed to take necessary precautions to protect their web browsing habits, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out tool.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Evidence emerging from the Vatican in recent days strongly suggests Pope Francis is transforming the Catholic Church into a socialist political organization that embraces the LGBT agenda, in complete rejection of the traditional pro-family religious orientation of his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI.

Last week, Pope Francis fired the Vatican’s top theologian, Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Mueller, the head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, who had a reputation as a staunch defender of the traditional family.

Pope Francis replaced Cardinal Mueller with the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith’s second-in-command, the more liberal Archbishop Luis Francisco Ladaria Ferrer.

Then, on Thursday, July 5, the Daily Mail in London reported Vatican police had broken up a gay orgy occurring in the Vatican-owned apartment belonging to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.

Ironically, this was also the Vatican department Pope Francis had assigned to investigate the Catholic Church’s pedophile sex scandal involving priests in the United States as well as various other countries around the world.

The apartment was apparently the residence of the male secretary to Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio, one of Pope Francis’ key advisors, and the president of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, another key part of the Roman Curia responsible for administering the activities of the Catholic Church worldwide.

Neither development surprised reporter George Neumayr, whose recent book, The Political Pope: How Pope Francis is Delighting the Liberal Left and Abandoning Conservatives, predicted Pope Francis will accelerate the transformation of the Catholic Church into a leftist political organization after former Pope Benedict XVI dies.

“Pope Francis inherited Cardinal Muller from his predecessor and was itching to sack him,” Neumayr explained to Infowars.com in an email.

“Pope Francis was annoyed by Muller’s opposition to the relativism of this pontificate, particularly Muller’s resistance to the pope’s plan to relax the Church’s teaching on adultery,” Neumayr continued.

“Muller also opposed the pope’s policy of distributing Communion to divorced-and-remarried Catholics,” Neumayr added.

Neumayr interpreted the move as Pope Francis distancing himself from the more conservative, traditional papacy of Pope Benedict XVI.

“By dropping Muller, Pope Francis is trying to free himself for once and all from the conservative restraints of Pope Benedict XVI, whose opposition to the ‘dictatorship of relativism’ Pope Francis always disliked,” Neumayr explained.

“Appropriately, Pope Francis has replaced Muller with a fellow Jesuit, the Spanish archbishop Luis Ladaria Ferrer, who appears willing to serve as a rubber stamp for the pope’s liberalism,” Neumayr concluded.

Neumayr also commented on the developing Vatican gay sex orgy scandal.

“This is proof the gay mafia has reached the highest echelons of the Catholic Church,” Neumayr told Infowars.com in an exclusive telephone interview.

“Instead of disbanding the gay mafia, Pope Francis evidently has allowed the gay mafia to burrow deeper into the Vatican.”

Neumayr referenced the decision Pope Francis made in July 2013 to appoint Monsignor Battista Ricca, a veteran Vatican diplomat, to serve as his representative, or “prelate” at the Vatican Bank despite allegations of various gay sexual scandals that plagued Ricca since 1999, when he was sent by the Vatican to Montevideo, Uruguay.

“The ecclesiastical head of the Vatican Bank is still Monsignor Ricca,” Neumayr commented, “and he was entangled in a similar gay sexual scandal before his elevation to his current position.”

Neumayr noted that Pope Francis was aware of the sexual scandal allegations made against Ricca, but Pope Francis decided to disregard the charges when he decided to go ahead and make Ricca head of Vatican Bank anyway.

“No one should be surprised by these episodes — either the firing of Cardinal Mueller or the emerging gay orgy sex scandal,” Neumayr suggested.

“Both are consistent with the direction in which Pope Francis is taking the Catholic Church,” he concluded.

An “astonishing” rise in harmful Christian exorcisms is being partly driven by migrant communities, a think tank has warned.

A report by Theos, a think tank focusing on religion, found that experts were concerned that the “booming industry” in exorcisms was putting Christians’ mental health at risk.

The report, which examines the relationship between Christianity and mental health, said: “Exorcisms are now a booming industry in the UK, with a number of interviewees noting the astonishing increase in demand – often, as one noted, in defiance of any actual rules or procedures put in place by any church.”

It said that this industry was in part “driven by immigrant communities and Pentecostal churches which are very open about their exorcism services”.

According to New York Magazine and Huffington Post contributing writer Yashar Ali, Secret Service agents interviewed Kathy Griffin for over an hour on Monday to discuss the photo where she posed with Donald Trump’s bloody head in her hand.

Like many of his fellow Polish pro-government lawmakers, Dominik Tarczynski is sending a busload of constituents to Warsaw on Thursday to cheer for President Donald Trump. The buses are being provided by a foundation close to the governing party.

“It’s going to be huge—absolutely huge,” Mr. Tarczynski said of the coming welcome for Mr. Trump. “They just love him, the people in Poland—they just really love him.”

Poland is working to put on a hero’s welcome for Mr. Trump as he prepares to give a major speech to thousand of Poles in a Warsaw square. Behind that effort is a recognition across the continent that Mr. Trump has the potential to change the balance of power in Europe.

Parents in France will be legally obliged to vaccinate their children from 2018, the government has announced.

French Prime Minister Édouard Philippe said it was “unacceptable” that children are “still dying of measles” in the country where some of the earliest vaccines were pioneered.

Three childhood vaccines, for diphtheria, tetanus and polio, are currently mandatory in France. Others, including those against hepatitis and whooping cough, are simply recommended.

Announcing the policy, Mr Philippe evoked the name of Louis Pasteur, the French biologist who made breakthroughs in disease research and developed the first vaccines for rabies and anthrax in the 19th century.

The acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under the Trump Administration is the same bureaucrat responsible for overseeing the release of violent criminal illegal aliens into U.S. communities under the Obama Administration. The acting director, Thomas Homan, previously headed Obama’s Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), a position where Homan helped direct the release of criminal illegal aliens. Homan received an award from President Obama for his work on immigration matters.

The agents and officers in the National ICE Council are sounding the alarm that such a bureaucrat would somehow be chosen by the Trump Administration to lead a flagship effort such as immigration law enforcement. ICE Council President Chris Crane, also an ICE Officer, spoke with Breitbart Texas and painted a dismal picture of the politics playing out in how our nation’s immigration laws are enforced.

“It is a disgrace that the man who oversaw Obama’s effort to release criminal illegal aliens into our country is now the acting director of ICE,” said Officer Crane. “Someone under Trump has been allowed too much authority in choosing the worst possible Obama-holdover to lead the vital effort of enforcing our nation’s immigration laws.”

NPR faced accusations of political bias Tuesday for marking the Fourth of July by tweeting out the entire Declaration of Independence.

NPR has celebrated Independence Day for 29 years by having hosts, reporters and commentators read the Declaration of Independence on-air.

But a number of Twitter users slammed NPR for tweeting it this year, interpreting the outlet’s sharing of the founding U.S. document as a call “for revolution” and a way to “condone the violence.”

While some users ripped NPR, others mocked those who disapproved:

Cable network CNN identified the man allegedly responsible for creating a meme depicting US President Donald Trump body-slamming the network, an image the president shared on Twitter last week.

After the anonymous Reddit user, “HanAssholeSolo,” issued an apology, CNN graciously said it would not publicly expose the person’s identity if he agreed not to do it again – a move which many saw as blackmail.

In light of CNN’s threat to dox the anonymous Redditor, #CNNBlackmail became a top trend and the Internet naturally responded in kind with more memes depicting CNN being pulverized by President Trump.

Here are a few…

Despite claims President Donald Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton marked a resurgence in the voting power of Christians in America, a globalist publication is claiming the last election was “the death rattle of White Christian America.”

“Does Trump’s victory, then, represent the resurrection of White Christian America? The consequences of the 2016 elections are indeed sweeping,” wrote Robert Jones in an excerpt from his book “The End of White Christian America” reposted in The Atlantic.



“Republicans entered 2017 with control of both houses of Congress and the White House, and because the Republican-controlled Senate refused to consider an Obama appointee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in early 2016, Trump was able to nominate a conservative Supreme Court justice right out of the gate.”

“The evidence, however, suggests that Trump’s unlikely victory is better understood as the death rattle of White Christian America — the cultural and political edifice built primarily by white Protestant Christians — rather than as its resuscitation.”

While white evangelical Christians represented 21% of the general population at the time of the 2008 election, they comprised 26% of actual voters. In 2016, despite a decline in their proportion of the population to 17%, white evangelicals continued to represent 26% of voters – clear evidence President Trump’s warnings about the dire attacks on religious liberty resonated with evangelical voters.

“Despite the outcome of the 2016 elections, the key long-term trends indicate White Christian America’s decline is continuing unabated,” Jones suggested. “Over the last eight years, the percentage of Americans who identify as white and Christian fell 11 percentage points, and support for same-sex marriage jumped 18 percentage points.”

The campaign between Clinton and Trump presented voters two starkly contrasting views of America’s future, he added.

“Donald Trump’s campaign painted a bleak portrait of America’s present, set against a bright, if monochromatic, vision of 1950s America restored. Hillary Clinton’ campaign, by contrast, sought to replace the first African American president with the first female president and embraced the multicultural future of 2050, the year the Census Bureau originally projected the United States would become a majority nonwhite nation,” Jones claimed.

Jones, the chief executive of the Public Religion Research Institute, first made his opinions about the decline of white Christian America known in an op-ed written in the immediate aftermath of Trump’s victory.

“The waning numbers of white Christians in the country today may not have time on their side, but as the sun is slowly setting on the cultural world of white Christian America, they’ve managed, at least in this election, to rage against the dying of the light,” he wrote in The New York Times.

CNN Senior Political Analyst Ronald Brownstein recently argued both political parties represent “virtually mirror image Americas with very little overlap,” with the Democratic Party representing a coalition of voters that is “racially diverse, younger, more secular, overwhelmingly urbanized, and more rooted in the globalized, post-industrial and low-carbon economy.”

“That jagged contrast between what I have called the Democrats’ ‘Coalition of Transformation,’ which largely welcomes those changes, and the Republican ‘Coalition of Restoration,’ which largely feels unsettled or eclipsed by them, has become arguably the central fault line in American life.”

CNN host Alisyn Camerota could not contain her excitement at the fact that her network had tracked down the Reddit user who created the Trump wrestling meme, and that he has issued an apology, despite the fact that CNN is being accused of using sinister blackmail tactics, threatening to publicly identify the person.

“I thought it was remarkable that CNN found the Reddit user who created the GIF,” a clearly enthusiastic Camerota told viewers.

The anchor read out a statement of apology from the meme creator (pictured below).





“…the investigative team went back and found the guy who first created this,” she noted, adding “How often do you hear someone who creates a video, goes viral, and apologizes.”

“The reason that I think this is so notable … This is a very, full-throated, genuine honest apology,” Camerota said. “He has also asked that we not reveal his name or whereabouts, and we at CNN are honoring that because he’s apologized, and he thinks that he would then be in danger and at risk if other people knew his name. We get it. We understand that.”

Reporter Chris Cillizza said that it was a very “nice thing” that CNN “tracked him down,” while CNN host Chris Cuomo stated that the individual apologized after he was “exposed and identified.”

However, Cuomo’s assertions run in contradiction to the claims of CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski, who is accused of carrying out the blackmailing.

Kaczynski claims that the user posted an apology before he was contacted.

https://twitter.com/KFILE/status/882418323673239553

Kaczynski also claims that the ‘threat’ CNN made to dox the individual is being ‘misinterpreted’.

https://twitter.com/KFILE/status/882438606270410752

https://twitter.com/KFILE/status/882417992717537280

CNN’s Chris Cuomo also took to Twitter to slam the individual for being a ‘ faceless hater’:

is being faceless getting old? own your words with an identity. truth, faceless hater, is not about telling you what you want to hear https://t.co/VKyFkQ7eJo — Christopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) July 5, 2017

Cuomo was quickly reminded that most of CNN’s hit pieces on the President have relied on ‘anonymous sources’:

CNN reporters now going after anonymity CNN has relied on anon sources for dozens of nonsense Trump/Russia stories, incl retracted stories https://t.co/oHvWbLKhmB — Omri Ceren (@omriceren) July 5, 2017

When Americans responded to Cuomo by saying CNN’s ratings were collapsing, the reporter just dug in deeper:

The culprit behind a shocking “unprovoked attack” on a female police officer had spouted anti-cop rhetoric in the past and urged people to vote for Hillary Clinton.

Authorities are trying to piece together a motive after NYPD officer and mother of three Miosotis Familia was brutally gunned down in cold blood by Alexander Bonds early Monday morning while she sat in a temporary headquarters vehicle at East 183rd Street and Morris Avenue in Fordham Heights.

Bonds was subsequently killed by two other officers called to the scene while Familia died in hospital.

“This is absolutely an unprovoked attack,” said NYPD Commissioner James P. O’Neill. Police say surveillance footage shows Bonds pulling up his hoodie before “purposefully” walking up to the vehicle and shooting through the passenger side.

Speculation as to why 34-year-old Bonds, who had previously served seven years in prison for a Syracuse robbery, gunned down Familia has begun to center on his political beliefs.

Bonds’ Facebook page reveals that days before the presidential election, he posted a video of a woman alleging that voting machines were switching Hillary Clinton votes to Donald Trump.

“Watch out also go vote our voices matter believe that if I could I kno u would,” he wrote.

On the same day he urged people to “get mad” about the election and vote. When asked who he was voting for, Bonds responded that he couldn’t vote (due to his felony conviction), but said people should vote for Hillary Clinton.

According to the New York Daily News, Bonds, “Spoke critically of law enforcement on an unspecified social media site.”

The video below features Bonds engaged in a foul-mouthed rant against the police.

Man who murdered NYPD officer Miosotis Familia posted anti-police video on Facebook. pic.twitter.com/bqTP18XFOu — Josh Caplan (@joshdcaplan) July 5, 2017

Bonds also posted Malcolm X memes as well as videos of confrontations between black people and police officers.

Previous ambush-style murders of police officers have been motivated by extremist anti-cop ‘Black Lives Matter’-style rhetoric, as well as mass shootings of police officers like the Dallas massacre, which was celebrated by BLM sympathizers.

There has been no word yet from prominent ‘Black Lives Matter’ personalities about the killing of Miosotis Familia.

CNN’s terrifying decision to threaten to personally destroy HanAssholeSolo, the person who created the epic WWE video President Trump tweeted out last week, CNN’s chilling move to go the full-Brownshirt against some nobody goofing on the Internet, does not surprise me at all.

What is a little shocking is how open the leftwing network was about its mafia tactics. A threat, an actual threat, a warning to others, right there in print! On CNN! [emphasis added]

CNN, a multi-billion dollar, mega-media corporation will be watching the behavior of a private citizen (all of us, really) and should this person (all of us, really) ever be discovered behaving in a way that this multi-billion dollar, mega-media corporation disapproves, this multi-billion dollar, mega-corporation will ruin this person’s life (all of our lives, really) — will reveal YOUR name, will see to it that you lose your job, are harassed out of your home, and whatever other horrors CNN’s fascist SJW Army can come up with.

Newly released data from the NHS shows there were more than 5,000 new cases of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) recorded over the last year, with 120 cases involving women and girls that were born in the UK.

The practice is banned in the UK, however, many families take young girls out of the country in order to undergo the barbaric procedure. Since 1985 when it became illegal in the UK, not a single parent has been prosecuted.

Data suggests those most at risk are girls from Egypt, Gambia, Kenya and Nigeria. Around a third of all cases involves girls from Somalia.

CNN is reeling from a huge backlash after the news organization was accused of blackmailing the creator of the infamous Trump-CNN wrestling meme by threatening to reveal his identity.

The mainstream media thought it had scored a victory when it was discovered that the original creator of the meme had previously posted racist content.

However, the individual, know by his handle ‘HanAssholeSolo’, has if anything been turned into a martyr.

The controversy erupted when CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski bragged that CNN had refrained from publishing HanAssholeSolo’s real name because he had “issued an extensive statement of apology,” showed remorse and promised not to make fun of CNN again.

“CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change,” stated the article.

This led to a firestorm of fury, with even many on the left slamming CNN for its unethical, and possibly illegal, practice.

Kaczynski then attempted to claim that HanAssholeSolo had apologized before CNN contacted him, contradicting his previous tweet which stated that HanAssholeSolo’s apology “came after CNN identified and reached out to him.”

The reaction on Twitter was vitriolic as #CNNBlackmail began trending.

Wikileaks’ Julian Assange posted a number of tweets in which he documented how CNN had broken the law, as well as tweeting, “A multi-billion dollar TV network blackmailing a private citizen into not making funny videos about it is not journalism, CNN.”

CNN essentially blackmailed a private citizen because he made fun of CNN.

Let that sink in.

Should a news organization that blackmails private citizens be allowed to have White House press access?

Fresh off the back of James O’Keefe’s CNN exposé , the news network is on the ropes. It’s difficult to see how they’re going to recover from this one without huge damage to their credibility.

It also remains to be seen whether the originator of the meme, who some claim could be as young as 15-years-old (although Kaczynski denies this), will seek to launch a lawsuit against CNN.

Leftist media figures questioned whether or not President Trump was threatening them after he tweeted on Monday that “at some point” the news “will be forced to discuss our great job numbers” and “strong economy.”

From Breitbart:

Trump tweeted: “At some point the Fake News will be forced to discuss our great jobs numbers, strong economy, success with ISIS, the border & so much else!”

NBC’s Katy Tur oh-so-seriously and ominously asked on-air what Trump meant by “forced.” Talking Points Memo asked, “Trump declares the press will be “forced” to cover his achievements. What First Amendment?”

Later in the day, though he did not specifically mention or refer to the tweet, NBC’s Chuck Todd spoke generally about Trump’s “dehumanizing” tweets.

“If these actions and this language was being used by a leader in a different country, our State Department… not just we in general… would be saying ‘Hmm, that country is inching towards authoritarianism,'” Todd said. “Because that’s usually the first sign: when you try to delegitimize a free press.”

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un promised more small and big “gift packages” for “the US imperialists” while he was pleased to observe the first successful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test, according to the North’s official state media.

Lauding the DPRK’s scientists and pleased with the fact that Tuesday’s successful launch coincided with Independence Day in the US, Kim Jong-un called to “frequently send big and small ‘gift packages’ to the Yankees as ever so that they will not feel weary,” the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said, as cited by KCNA Watch on Wednesday.

The report added that Kim was “feasting his eyes” on the latest addition to the North’s arsenal before the test, calling it the final phase of “the protracted showdown with the US imperialists,” which can “demonstrate its mettle to the US which is testing its will in defiance of its warning.”

On Tuesday morning, Pyongyang claimed it had successfully launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile, Hwasong-14, which is capable of carrying a “large, heavy nuclear warhead.” The missile, which can reportedly strike the US mainland, was called “another brilliant victory of the Korean people in their struggle against the US-led imperialists.”

“The test-launch confirmed the features of the rocket’s blast-off from its launching pad and technological features of its guidance and stability system in its active-flight stages and structural system,” KCNA reported.

After the launch, Pyongyang said its Hwasong-14 ICBM flew some 933km in 39 minutes, reaching an altitude of 2,802km, according to state television.

However, there are different estimates of the range of the latest missile. The US military initially said the rocket was a land-based intermediate-range ballistic missile, which fell into the Sea of Japan (known in Korea as the East Sea) after covering more than 930km in 37 minutes.

Later in the day Washington changed its assessment, saying that Pyongyang’s rocket had a two-stage design which would allow the projectile to fly the range required to be classed as an ICBM.

Meanwhile the South Korean military confirmed that its northern neighbor tested a new ICBM, according to Yonhap.

On Tuesday, the Russian Defense Ministry stated that North Korea launched an intermediate range missile (IRBM), which flew some 535 kilometers, reaching an altitude of 510km, and fell into the Sea of Japan, according to its data.

The type of the missile determines the distance it can cover and thus whether it would be able to reach and strike the United States, which is treated as one of the top threats to North Korean security and vice versa. ICBMs can cover a distance of more than of 5,500km and can potentially hit the US, while IRBMs have a much shorter range and pose no threat.

The test launch triggered the world’s reaction, from world leaders’ statements to joint drills. On Tuesday, Moscow and Beijing called on North Korea to freeze its nuclear and missile programs, and at the same time urged the US and South Korea to abstain from holding war games in the region.

Despite the warnings, the US and South Korean militaries launched surface-to-surface tactical missiles into neutral waters, with the American side threatening to deploy and engage missile systems in case of further provocation from the North.

However, Pyongyang is apparently not planning to stop its nuclear and missile tests as long as Washington follows a “hostile policy” towards Pyongyang and poses a “nuclear threat.”

“The DPRK would neither put its nukes and ballistic rockets on the table of negotiations in any case nor flinch even an inch from the road of bolstering the nuclear force chosen by itself unless the US hostile policy and nuclear threat to the DPRK are definitely terminated,” state media KCNA said.

Over the past 20 years, European cities have slowly become more ethnically diverse, as EU governments open their borders to foreign populations.

And as this process has taken place, the authorities have been quick to cover up any crimes that have been committed by these populations. For instance, Swedish police are no longer allowed to describe the ethnic background of the criminals they catch, and most notably, the German government and press were desperate to cover up hundreds sexual assaults that occurred in Cologne in 2015.

However, there are certain statistics that can’t be covered up. A government can try to conceal the connection between crimes and specific ethnic groups, but they can’t cover up the overall crime statistics of an entire city. Plus, politically correct governments can’t really hide the ethnic diversity of their cities. That’s something that their progressive sensibilities command them to promote.

Fortunately, sometimes those two factors come together to give us all a good look at the relationship between immigration and crime in Europe, despite the best efforts of European governments to conceal that connection. For example, the German government recently revealed that more than half of the population of Frankfurt has a foreign background, arguably making it the most diverse major city in Germany.

For the first time, more than half of Frankfurt residents now have a migrant background, according to official data from the city’s Office of Statistics and Elections. Presenting the figures, which show that 51.2 per cent of people living in Frankfurt have a migrant background, the city’s secretary of integration Sylvia Weber said: “We have minorities with relatively large numbers in Frankfurt but no group with a clear majority.” Representing 13 per cent of the population, Turks are the city’s largest non-German minority, and 61 per cent of residents who were born abroad are citizens of other European Union (EU) countries.

And on top of that, the data reveals that these people aren’t thriving in Germany. 49% of people with foreign backgrounds in Frankfurt live below the poverty line, compared to 23% of native Germans, and they are significantly more likely to be unemployed. But that’s not the real kicker. Frankfurt was a diverse city long before the migrant crisis reached its peak, and even then it had a startling crime rate.

The 2013 national crime figures, which were leaked to Welt newspaper earlier this week, show just under six million crimes were recorded in Germany last year. When broken down to the number of crimes per 100,000 inhabitants, Frankfurt am Main rates as the most dangerous city in Germany with 16,292 crimes per 100,000 people. Its high ranking was put down to its red light district and the large airport.

Of course if you brought this fact up to most leftists, they would call you a racist. But it has nothing to do with race. The real problem is that Germany hasn’t properly vetted their immigrants, nor have they successfully assimilated them. Germany is inviting people into their country who have no respect for German law, and they aren’t pressuring them to join German culture. And the result is rather predictable. Germany has a large foreign population that is young, jobless, alienated from mainstream culture, and more likely to commit crimes.

What we’re seeing in Frankfurt is the future of Europe, if EU nations continue to celebrate multiculturalism and leave their borders wide open. It will be a divided continent, filled with ethnic enclaves, no-go zones, civil unrest, and crime. If they don’t see the folly of multiculturalism, within a generation every city in Europe will be like Frankfurt, or perhaps even worse.

French president Emmanuel Macron has declared he will govern France like Jupiter, the Roman king of the gods, shortly after officials told the media his thought process was “too complex” for journalists to understand.

Summoning over 900 politicians from both houses of the French parliament to a rare Congress at the palace of Louis XIV – the ‘Sun King’ – in Versailles, he threatened to overrule lawmakers with a referendum if they try to frustrate the “reforms” he wishes to impose on the legislature. Such assemblies are usually reserved for times of national crisis.

Reuters reports him as saying he desires to reign as a “Jupiterian” president – “a remote, dignified figure, like the Roman god of gods, who weighs his rare pronouncements carefully”.

Amid North Korea’s repeated missile launches, evacuation drills conducted with the participation of local residents and based on the scenario that a missile strike is imminent are being held in many places across the nation.

Such drills have already been conducted in nine prefectures, and there are more scheduled to be carried out in at least 11 prefectures.

This month, the nation’s first drill in which people will evacuate to an underground mall is scheduled to occur in Takaoka, Toyama Prefecture.

People who might face such an emergency are required to evacuate in a different way than in the event of an earthquake.

Bill Gates has blasted Germany’s open-door migrant policy warning European leaders they must make it more difficult for North Africans to reach the continent.

The Microsoft founder and world’s richest person said Europe will not be able to handle the huge numbers of people desperately trying to leave Africa.

This comes as Austrian tanks have moved to seal off a vital border with Italy as over 84,000 migrants from North African have reached Italian shores this year – a 19 per cent increase from last year according to the UN.

Spain is also struggling to cope with the crisis with 6,000 people arriving by boat this year and dozens drowning during the treacherous journey.

Speaking with German news outlet Welt am Sonntag newspaper, US billionaire Gates, 61, said developed nations should instead be spending more on foreign aid to treat the causes of migration.

He said: “On the one hand you want to demonstrate generosity and take in refugees.

“But the more generous you are, the more word gets around about this — which in turn motivates more people to leave Africa.

“Germany cannot possibly take in the huge number of people who are wanting to make their way to Europe.”

While the world watches in jest as Japanese residents prepare for the possibility of a confrontation with North Korea by panic buying nuclear shelters and air purifiers, we may soon realize that their efforts to desperately acquire protective gear and equipment for nuclear disaster were quite prescient.

Yesterday, North Korea successfully tested what is reportedly an ICBM (Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile) capable of striking Alaska from the Korean peninsula. Coupled with their purported advancements in nuclear technology, North Korea may now have the ability to launch devastating attacks on their southern neighbor, Japan and even the United States. And if they have not yet achieved the ability to fit a nuclear warhead on an ICBM and deliver it effectively to its target, they are inching closer by the day.

So close, in fact, that Chinese Ambassador Liu Jieyi’s recent remarks on the matter suggest that we are nearing a dangerous breaking point:

“Currently tensions are high and we certainly would like to see a de-escalation,” Liu told a news conference at UN headquarters as China takes over the Security Council presidency in July. “If tension only goes up … then sooner or later it will get out of control and the consequences would be disastrous,” he said.

Earlier this year President Trump deployed three carrier strike groups to the region, signaling the real possibility that the United States will no longer follow what Secretary of State Rex Tillerson calls a policy of “strategic patience” employed by Trump’s predecessors.

Though the threat seems to be muted by global media, China and Russia appear to be taking it very seriously, with both having reportedly deployed tens of thousands of troops and equipment to their respective borders with the North.

All of the signs suggest that military action is about to occur. And while most Americans may think that North Korea would be another Iraq, wherein the battle could be won in a matter days, the fact is that North Korea has a massive military and now, as confirmed yesterday, an ICBM capable of striking long-range targets.

Now may be a good time to imitate the Japanese by preparing for the worst, because the moment the world realizes that war is imminent there will be a run on banks and grocery stores that will likely leave shelves and ATM machines completely empty. Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the price of government recommended anti-radiation pills skyrocketed from $15 to over $200 per unit. We expect to see a similar effect in coming weeks and months for preparedness equipment like gas masks and NBC body suits as tensions on the Peninsula heat up.

War is coming. President Trump has made this very clear and North Korea does not appear to be heeding his warning. All bets will be off once the missiles start flying.

Because all three of the world’s major super powers will be involved in one way or another it is not only possible, but quite likely that things could spiral out of control very quickly.

A female New York City police officer has died after being shot in the Bronx early Wednesday in what police described as an “unprovoked attack.”

Police rushed to the scene in Fordham in the area of 183rd Street and Morris Avenue around 12:30 a.m. The officer, identified as 48-year-old Miosotis Familia, was sitting in a marked NYPD command vehicle with her partner when she was shot, Commissioner James P. O’Neill said at a Wednesday morning press conference.

O’Neill said the suspect fired through the window of the car, striking the officer in the head. Her partner immediately radioed in for assistance.

“We are conducting an extensive search for video at this time,” O’Neill said at the press conference. “Based off what we know right now, it’s clear this was an unprovoked attack on a police officer who are assigned to keep the people of this great city safe.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Donald Trump will hold their first full-fledged meeting at the G20 summit on July 7, the Kremlin spokesman said. Dmitry Peskov specified it will not merely be a brief contact on the sidelines.

The meeting is “planned as a full-fledged ‘sit down’ meeting,” Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday.

The G20 summit will take place July 7-8 in Hamburg, Germany. During the summit, Trump is to meet Putin face-to-face for the first time. Previously the leaders have spoken only by phone.

The White House has also confirmed that a “normal bilateral meeting” between the leaders is to take place on Friday afternoon, according to Reuters.

Earlier, Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov said the long-awaited meeting is scheduled for July 7, but did not specify its format.

Conflicts in Syria and Ukraine will be among other issues on the agenda during the meeting between the two leaders, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov stated.

“Of course, both Syria and Ukraine will be in the spotlight, but the agenda is not limited to them,” Ryabkov told reporters in Moscow, adding that Putin and Trump are also to discuss strategic stability, as well as a number of bilateral issues.

“At least we believe that the American side will be ready for such dialogue, and we will see how the conversation really goes. Eventually, everything depends on the leaders,” Ryabkov said.

Relations between Moscow and Washington are currently “at the zero mark,” the Kremlin aide said, while pointing out that phone conversations aren’t enough to improve the situation.

Russian-American relations further deteriorated after Washington launched 59 Tomahawk missiles at Syria’s Shayrat Airbase near the city of Homs on April 7. The move came in retaliation to what Washington claimed was a Syrian government-orchestrated chemical weapons attack on Khan Shaykhun, which killed dozens of people. Damascus has firmly and repeatedly denied those allegations, while Moscow has repeatedly called for an international investigation to be conducted into the incident.

The populations of both nations see each other as foes, according to the latest polls. While 69 percent of Russian respondents consider America among hostile countries, according to a poll conducted by Russian research center Levada, a third of Americans surveyed said they view Russia as “unfriendly,” and a fifth regard it as an “enemy,” pollster YouGov has found.

Nasdaq has issued a market-wide trading halt amid what appears to be a “glitch” that sent a number of the largest Nasdaq-listed stocks to crash or spike to exactly $123.47 per share.

This move crashed the value of companies including Amazon and Apple, sparked chaos in Microsoft, while sending Zynga rocketing up more than 3000%.

On the eve of the US Independence Day holiday and in after-hours trading, The FT reports that market data show that companies such as Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, eBay and Zynga were repriced at $123.47.

The Bloomberg data terminal listed either “market wide circuit breaker halt — level 2” or “volatility trading pause” on all the stocks affected.



The glitch did not affect any market trading, including after hours.

The mysterious reset to $123.47 per share meant that Amazon in theory saw its share price marked down 87.2 per cent…

while shares in Apple fell 14.3 per cent…

But Nasdaq-listed Microsoft had jumped 79.1 per cent — which would value the company at nearly $1tn…

As Bloomberg reports, the apparent swings triggered trading halts in some securities, according to automatically generated messages. The halts are a mechanism exchanges use to limit the impact of particularly volatile sessions. A system status alert on Nasdaq’s website said that systems were operating normally at 8:23 p.m. ET. After-market hours on Nasdaq typically last from 4 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.

In a statement, Nasdaq said the glitch was related to “improper use of test data” sent out to third party data providers, and said it was working to “ensure a prompt resolution of this matter”. In cases of any clearly erroneous data, trades made are cancelled.

As a reminder this is not the first time ‘glitches’ have occurred on holidays… remember gold on Thanksgiving 2014.

Archeologists in China’s Shandong province unearthed skeletal remains of ‘giant’ humans who lived 5,000 years ago.

Since 2016, archeologists have been excavating a large site in the east of the country. The site contains the ruins of 104 houses, 205 graves and 20 sacrificial pits.

Dating from the late neolithic period, some 5,000 years ago, the relics belong to an ancient culture called the Longshan. Recently, scientists discovered human bones that are unusually tall and strong.

Analysis put the height of at least one man at 1.9 meters (6ft 3in), while quite a few others were 1.8 meters or taller. Considering the average height for a European in the late neolithic era was 1.65m these ancient humans would have towered above their counterparts.

Even today the average height for a man in Shandong is 1.75m, while China’s national average is 1.72m, according to China Daily.

“This is just based on the bone structure. If he was a living person, his height would certainly exceed 1.9 meters,” said Fang Hui, head of Shandong University’s school of history and culture, as cited by China Daily.

The taller men were found in larger tombs than the others, leading researchers to speculate that their height afforded them a higher status within the community.

Not all was rosy for the vertically privileged few though, as scientists discovered obvious damage to skull and leg bones which may have been down to power struggles between high-ranking individuals, as the old adage goes ‘the bigger they are, the harder they fall.’

Monday night on Fox News Channel, “Tucker Carlson Tonight” host Tucker Carlson mocked CNN for their analysts and reporters claiming President Donald Trump’s tweet of a video that showed him wrestling a man with a CNN logo superimposed over his head was a danger to journalists.

Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com

Carlson said, “Donald Trump’s feud with the media got even weirder and more intense over the weekend after the president tweeted a video of his staged brawl with wrestling mogul Vince McMahon with a CNN logo superimposed over McMahon’s face. It was a little confusing since CNN and pro wrestling could not be more different. One is an entertainment venture that promotes over-the-top fictional narratives and rigs its fights. The other is the WWE, but whatever. There’s a word for this. It’s called trolling, the digital version of getting someone’s goat. Should the president take time from running the free world to drive the media insane? Maybe not. Probably not. But he obviously enjoys it quite a bit.”

Another city is joining the nationwide movement to purge streets, statues and monuments honoring Confederate generals: Hollywood.

“It is time to change the names and the time is now,” Commissioner Debra Case said Monday during a City Hall meeting that drew prominent elected officials from around the county. “We must do the right thing and we must do it now.”

It wasn’t quick and it wasn’t easy.

But on Monday, more than a week after a raucous protest at City Hall that resulted in five arrests, Hollywood commissioners agreed to rename streets honoring three Civil War-era generals: Robert E. Lee, John Bell Hood and Nathan Bedford Forrest, who was also first grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.

Moscow and Beijing have agreed that North Korea should freeze its nuclear and missile programs, while the US and South Korea should abstain from holding war games in the region, Russian President Vladimir Putin said.

“We’ve agreed to promote our joint initiative, based on Russian step-by-step Korean settlement plan and Chinese ideas to simultaneously freeze North Korean nuclear and missile activities, and US and South Korean joint military drills,” Putin said at a press conference after meeting with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, in Moscow.

“We believe that the outer world is turbulent, local conflicts are emerging constantly, such issues as the Korean peninsula problem, Syrian question, remain very complex,” Xi Jinping said.

Russia’s president stressed that the two countries have either the same, or very close positions on many international issues.

“We intend to further develop our foreign policy coordination,” Putin said.

Moscow and Beijing stressed the importance of taking North Korea’s concerns over its safety into consideration, calling them “justified.”

“The two sides stress that justified North Korean concerns should be respected,” a joint statement by Russia’s and China’s foreign ministers reads. “Other countries should make certain moves to resume the negotiations, creating a peaceful disposition and mutual trust.”

“A possibility of the use of military measures to solve the problems of the Korean Peninsula must be ruled out,” the joint statement stressed.

While condemning Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile tests as violating UN Security Council resolutions, Moscow and Beijing urged the United States to immediately halt its deployment of THAAD anti-missile systems to South Korea.

“The sides agree that the deployment of THAAD anti-missile systems to Northeast Asia gravely damages strategic safety interests of regional powers, including Russia and China and do not contribute to the de-nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, as well as towards establishing peace and stability in the region,” the statement reads.

“Russia and China oppose the deployment of the said systems and call on the countries involved to immediately halt and cancel the process of their deployment.”

Russia and China’s calls for de-escalation and negotiation are clearly a step into right direction if the ongoing Korean crisis is to be untangled, Asia-Pacific defense consultant Jack Midgley believes.

“North Korea now has at least a limited ballistic missile capability; they have at least a limited nuclear weapons capability. The question is: how will the world deal with the emergence of this new set of facts,” Midgley said, adding “the experience of the last 60 years is very consistent there – it’s that the only way forward that actually works is to bring the parties together and to negotiate.”

Many Americans gathering to celebrate Independence Day will mark the holiday at Arlington National Cemetery. But for visitors feeling patriotic, there is one item that is banned on the hallowed grounds: a waving American flag.

Earl Granville, a retired Army staff sergeant and veterans advocate who lost his leg in a bombing in Afghanistan, said that he was surprised to learn about the obscure federal law that prohibits visitors from carrying an unfurled U.S. flag at the cemetery.

“There’s absolutely, positively nothing disrespectful whatsoever about carrying the colors to the cemetery where our fallen armed forces are buried,” Granville said.

The law — 38 U.S. Code § 2413 — emerged in 2006 when former U.S. Rep. Mike D. Rogers (R-Mich.) grew angry after watching mourners at a military burial face “chants and taunting and some of the most vile things I have ever heard,” Rogers told the Associated Press at the time.

Austria has mobilized its military to maintain security along its border with Italy as the explosion of migrants crossing over from Africa reaches catastrophic proportions.

The Austrian government has moved 750 troops and four Pandur armored vehicles into the Tyrol region, where they can quickly deploy to the Brenner Pass, the primary connector between Austria and Italy through the Alps, if necessary.

“We need to prepare for the migration development in Italy, and I expect very promptly that border controls will be activated and assistance requested,” said Austrian Defense Minister Hans Peter Doskozil in comments to local press.

His spokesman said the flood of migrants into Italy is unsustainable, and that riot tanks would have to be deployed.

“These are not battle tanks,” he said. “These are armoured vehicles without weapons which could block roads. These were already used during the refugee crisis of 2015/16 at the Spielfeld border crossing (with Slovenia).”

Italy’s foreign ministry has summoned the Austrian ambassador to discuss Vienna’s statements and movements.

The UN International Organization for Migration has announced that over 100,000 migrants have entered Europe in the first six months of 2017 via the Mediterranean, with nearly 85% arriving in Italy from Libya alone.

At the same time, the UN refugee agency just released a new report stating that at least seven out of 10 illegal immigrants from Africa are not refugees at all, but instead are economic migrants, as Infowars has documented at length.

Austria’s decision to militarily fortify its border comes on the heels of a recent meeting between six central European nations seeking to form a new anti-migrant defense coalition.

Defense ministers and officials from Austria, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Slovenia, and Croatia met in Prague earlier this month to discuss the details of the Central European Defence Cooperation (CEDC) that will act as “the framework of civil-military cooperation” between the nations who seek to handle the on-going crisis in a markedly different manner than Brussels and other EU member states, such as Germany, Sweden and Italy.

“At the meeting, the participants issued a short declaration which welcomes the Joint Action Plan and calls on the interior ministers of the involved countries to finalize it in the shortest time possible,” read a statement from the Hungarian Ministry of Defense regarding the meeting and developments to come. “The declaration takes note of the unified situation assessment, which facilitates the quick and joint mobilization of civilian, police and military capabilities, and states that the most important task is the protection of the external borders of the EU and the elimination of the root causes of migration in the sending countries.”

“Finally, the participants of the meeting talked about the wider context of Europe’s security situation and the next steps in strengthening the European common security and defence policy.”

A leading eco-toxicologist has warned that the quantity of synthetic chemicals entering our watershed is feminizing fish populations to such a degree that several species now boast transgender and intersex fish, with eggs in their testicles.

“If you look in terms of what gets into a fish’s liver or gonad, the analysis of the chemicals it contains is a bit of a blueprint in terms of what’s flushed down the toilet,” Professor Charles Tyler, of the University of Exeter said, speaking to The Independent.

“We’re starting to establish not just effects on gender, but that they can also affect other physiological processes in the fish as well,” he added.

Tyler will give a keynote speech on the topic of ‘transgender’ or ‘intersex’ fish at the 50th Anniversary Symposium of the Fisheries Society in the British Isles at Exeter University from July 3 to 7.

Tyler participated in the research project, ‘Roach, Sex, and Gender-Bending Chemicals: The Feminization of Wild Fish in English Rivers’ in 2008 in which one fifth of the male fish studied possessed feminized traits including, but not limited to, reduced sperm quality, decreased aggression and competitive behavior, which impeded their success when breeding. Some male fish had even begun producing eggs.

“It all depends how feminized they become. If they are moderately to severely feminized, they are compromised as individuals and they really struggle to pass on their genes,” Tyler said. “One thing scientists are becoming much, much more conscious of now … is wildlife populations are exposed to a combination of stresses.”

The research identified more than 200 chemicals in river water which had characteristics similar to estrogen and antidepressants.

Endocrine disruptors, the chemicals found in pesticides, detergents, certain foods, the contraceptive pill and cosmetics are the type of chemical responsible for the marked change in sexuality and behavior of fish.

A separate study from 2010 found that more than 80 percent of male bass fish in the Potomac river in Washington DC exhibited female traits, including growing eggs in their testes as a result of rainwater and sewage water containing a mix of endocrine disruptors entering the area’s watershed.

Catalonia, a region of northeastern Spain, will declare immediate independence if voters approve a referendum in October.

The autonomous area best known for the city of Barcelona is controlled by those seeking to forge a new nation separate from Spain.

“If the majority of votes are for creating a Catalan republic, obviously independence will have to be declared immediately,” said Gabriela Serra, a member of the independence coalition governing Catalonia.

Catalonia has always had its own distinctive culture and language (Catalan) – and sovereign nations are defined by their homogenous identities.

The region was once a principality with its own laws and customs that flourished until power over the Iberian peninsula was centralized by the Spanish crown.

But to gain independence again, Catalonia must overcome several challenges since the upcoming referendum was not approved by Spain.

Without Madrid’s help, the independence coalition will need to create a commission to provide the ballot boxes and oversee the election – all while preventing loyalist saboteurs from rigging the vote.

Spain – and likely the EU by extension – doesn’t want an independent Catalonia and right now voters are split on the issue, and it’s easy for loyalists to steal an election when it’s that close.

“Madrid has remained steadfast in its opposition to such a vote, considering it a threat to Spain’s unity, and this time is no different,” reported France 24.

The Drudge Report conducted a poll asking readers if they would like to see President Trump continue using social media or not, and the message is loud and clear: America loves Trump tweets.

With nearly half a million votes cast at the time of this writing, support for the President’s use of socials stands at a stunning 77.45% with less than one in four respondents wishing he would stop.

The results starkly contradict findings from a Fox News phone poll of 1,017 viewers, 71% of whom felt that Trump was ‘hurting his agenda’ by using Twitter. The average age of Fox viewers is 68.

The Drudge poll was launched in the wake a liberal meltdown after Trump’s tweets about affianced MSNBC co-hosts “low IQ Crazy Mika” Brzezinski and “Pyscho Joe” Scarborough, and after the initial 175,000 votes had been cast, 74.46% backed Trump tweets.

And then Trump ‘body-slammed’ CNN.

President Trump went all-in on Sunday, posting one of his most popular tweets of all time – a user-created video parody of Trump body-slamming pro wrestling tycoon Vince McMahon with McMahon’s head replaced by a CNN logo.

Despite leftists, media hacks, and celebrities reaching new stages of nuclear outrage, positive votes in the Drudge poll have continued to pour in, boosting endorsement of Trump’s “Modern Day Presidential” approach to connecting directly with the American public.

After a week in which investigative reporters at Project Veritas dropped bombshell after bombshell on CNN, and the globalist press were savaged by the alt media and watchdogs alike, Trump has utilized socials to turn up the heat on the #FakeNews media – a move that is likely emboldening his supporters to stay involved and keep a bright spotlight pointed at the anti-American narrative manipulators who have been deceiving them for decades.

“The fake media is trying to silence us but we will not let them,” Trump said during a speech at the Celebrate Freedom Rally on Saturday. “The people know the truth. The fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House, but I’m president and they’re not.”

“The dishonest media will not stop us from accomplishing our objectives on behalf of the American people,” he continued. “Their agenda is not your agenda.”

….the 2016 election with interviews, speeches and social media. I had to beat #FakeNews, and did. We will continue to WIN! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 1, 2017

“The FAKE & FRAUDULENT NEWS MEDIA is working hard to convince Republicans and others I should not use social media – but remember, I won the 2016 election with interviews, speeches and social media,” Trump Tweeted on Saturday. “I had to beat # FakeNews, and did. We will continue to WIN!”

The media’s obsession with Trump tweets has provided an effective smoke screen while he implements the America First agenda and dismantles destructive globalist programs, most recently and aggressively phased in by Barack Obama.

“Last week was a great example: While the fake journalists at the NYTimes, CNN, MSNBC, the WaPo and the three broadcast networks gave most of their print space and air time to rants about the President’s latest tweets about Mika and Joe, the President’s EPA announced the full repeal of the horrible Obama-era power grab called the Waters Of The United States rule,” writes energy analyst David Blackmon. “This massive regulation would have basically given the EPA authority to regulate any temporary or permanent body of water in the entire nation, including puddles in your lawn, drainage ditches, overflowing swimming pools, and even city streets that are designed to carry storm water that ultimately drains into rivers and lakes.”

Trump’s most recent tweet was an offer to assist the family of Charlie Gard, a dying baby from the UK whose parents are seeking potentially life-saving experimental treatment for Charlie in the United States, but have been blocked from traveling to do so by UK and EU courts who have ordered that the boy’s life support be turned off despite the Gards raising over $1 million dollars for his treatment.

If we can help little #CharlieGard, as per our friends in the U.K. and the Pope, we would be delighted to do so. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2017

In addition to declaring that the WWE wrestling meme tweeted by President Trump last week was an ‘incitement to violence’, CNN has now claimed that it also raises “questions” about “racism, bigotry, and antisemitism.”

Why is a gif of Trump ‘clotheslining’ CNN (really Vince McMahon) in a staged fight probably racist? Because someone else who posted it on Reddit has previously posted offensive content, CNN reports.

CNN correspondent Tom Foreman pointed to a report by thevirulently left wing and anti-Trump organisation the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) which has claimed the Reddit user “is like many other online bigots who use platforms like Reddit to anonymously share their hateful words and images.”

It was only a matter of time folks… CNN: Trump's Wrestling Meme May Be Racist, Antisemitic https://t.co/DdCFgavmKK via @BreitbartNews — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 3, 2017

The ADL claims that “For more than a year, this Reddit user has violated the platform’s terms of service by posting the type of hate against Muslims, African-Americans, Jews and others…”

“In fact, the individual posted an image collage of CNN journalists and employees labeling them with a Star of David and writing, “Something strange about CNN…can’t quite put my finger on it…”

“We have been analyzing the online activities of this individual and found a consistent record of racism, anti-Semitism and bigotry for more than a year on Reddit,” said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO.

Besides the fact that the President obviously has no knowledge of or connections to this individual, there is no actual evidence that this individual created the wrestling Trump meme at all, as it has been floating around the internet for some time.

In addition, the ADL is notorious for labeling everyone and everything it does not agree with as racist.

Last year the organisation demanded that Trump stop using the phrase “America First” because it’s “anti-Semitic.” The ADL also declared the Pepe the Frog meme to be a ‘hate symbol’ akin to the swastika and burning crosses.

The ADL routinely mixes in non-violent activist movements with white supremacists and genuinely violent and distasteful groups to demonize big government critics, constitutionalists and libertarians as domestic extremists. The organization is obsessed with eviscerating the free speech of its political adversaries.

The ADL is an agenda-driven political outfit posing as an impartial organisation. In other words, it is a fake watchdog.

No matter. It seems CNN will go to any lengths in its obstruction campaign against Trump, including continuing to cite this thoroughly discredited organisation’s output, and openly calling the President a racist.

Will President Trump help medically transport a 10-month-baby from London to the U.S. before the government and his doctors pull the plug on his life support?

That’s the question being raised on Twitter Monday. And it wouldn’t be the first time Trump has intervened to medically transport a sick child for treatment.

Little Charlie Gard – a 10-month-old baby in London who has been blocked from traveling to the U.S. to receive potentially life-saving treatment and could be days from the end of his life – captured the attention of Trump and the pope Monday.

President Donald Trump’s first face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week will be brimming with global intrigue, but the White House says there’s “no specific agenda.”

So in the absence of a set list of topics, what are two of the world’s most famously unpredictable leaders to discuss?

Trump, who prefers to have neatly packaged achievements to pair with high-profile meetings, may be looking for some concessions from Russia to show he’s delivering progress and helping restore a productive relationship between the two powers. Putin would almost surely want something in return, and there’s a long list of “irritants” between the two countries that they could potentially resolve.

Arrests of illegal immigrants have more than doubled in San Diego, California, under President Trump’s immigration orders.

In a report by the San Diego Union-Tribune, new data shows that illegal immigrants in southern California are being arrested at roughly the same rate before former President Obama’s era of relaxed border policies.

Between February and May, nearly 550 illegal immigrants were arrested in San Diego alone by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.

Compare that to the number of illegal immigrants arrested in that same time period last year, where only 242 foreign nationals were arrested. In 2015, during the same time frame, ICE agents only arrested 267 illegal immigrants.

Amid North Korea’s repeated missile launches, evacuation drills conducted with the participation of local residents and based on the scenario that a missile strike is imminent are being held in many places across the nation.

Such drills have already been conducted in nine prefectures, and there are more scheduled to be carried out in at least 11 prefectures.

This month, the nation’s first drill in which people will evacuate to an underground mall is scheduled to occur in Takaoka, Toyama Prefecture.

Since the start of this year, North Korea has fired ballistic missiles that left and reentered the atmosphere nine times.

On Monday night, following news of the latest North Korean ballistic missile launch which as discussed earlier landed in the Sea of Japan, and specifically Japan’s quasi-sovereign Economic Exclusion Zone, Trump tweeted his reaction to the latest provocation, which probably falls under the “modern day presidential” umbrella.





Trump decided to eschew conventional diplomacy, and stated matter of facty, that “North Korea has just launched another missile” then prioeeded to ask of Kim Jong-Un, “does this guy have anything better to do with his life?”

North Korea has just launched another missile. Does this guy have anything better to do with his life? Hard to believe that South Korea….. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 4, 2017

Apparently the answer is no, which may explain why it was recently revealed that South Korea’s previous president was seriously contemplating the assassinating Kim.

In his second tweet, Trump added “gard to believe that South Korea and Japan will put up with this much longer. Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!.”

….and Japan will put up with this much longer. Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 4, 2017

Or perhaps after China slammed over the weekend the recent multi-billion US sale of weapons to China’s nemesis Taiwan, not to mention the deployment of a US missile-destroyer in the South China Seas which was promptly intercepted by Chinese forces, as well as Trump’s sanctioning of several Chinese entities for “doing business with North Korea, maybe China won’t do anything at all, and instead will cultivate and fund local and not so local terrorist to pick up the “global cleansing” role.

A new survey conducted by Ipsos Mori has revealed some staggering insights into how the French view Islam, society and migration in general.

60% of the French believe Islam is incompatible with French society, which is incredibly high given that only 8% would say the same about Catholicism and 19% about Judaism.

A further breakdown of the figures reveals that 74% of people believe that Islam seeks to impose its will on others, as opposed to 18% of people who believed the same about Catholicism.

The French are also fed up with mass immigration it would seem, 65% feel there are too many foreign people in France, according to the poll, which is down slightly from the 70% who said the same in 2013. (We guess 4 years of mass immigration would skew the results a little bit!)

Contrary to what the hard left would have you believe, attitudes are similar across all professions, from professionals to labourers:

The French also believe it is becoming harder to integrate migrants into French society, with 61% say that they believe immigrants do not make an effort to integrate properly into French life.

An explanatory note for the document says: “The 2017 wave of Fractures Français (report) reveals a generalised revival of confidence in the political, economic and regal institutions and a decline of the “declinist”. These positive movements do not, however, erase the pessimism which is still very marked within French society.”

Looks like Monsieur Macron still has a long way to go in restoring French confidence in their society, and the movement in attitudes suggests that papering over the cracks isn’t going to work forever…

The Russian Defense Ministry has stated that North Korea launched an intermediate range missile on Tuesday morning. The missile flew around 535 kilometers, reaching an altitude of 510 kilometers, and fell into the Sea of Japan, according to military data.

The missile test carried out by Pyongyang on Tuesday morning did not pose a threat to Russia, the defense ministry said in a statement.

“The launch was carried out in a direction away from Russia’s borders, and did not pose a threat to the Russian Federation,” the Russian military stated.

Russia’s missile warning system tracked the launch from North Korean territory, according to the military officials.

“The launch of a ballistic missile, carried out on July 4 at 3:46am Moscow time from a North Korean firing ground was recorded and tracked by Russia’s missile warning system,” an MoD statement said.

North Korea claimed that it had successfully launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile on Tuesday morning. Pyongyang said its Hwasong-14 ICBM flew some 933 kilometers in 39 minutes reaching an altitude of 2,802 kilometers, according to the country’s state television.

North Korea has repeatedly warned the US and its Asian allies, which conduct joint drills near the Korean Peninsula, that it would launch more missile and nuclear tests.

An intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launched from North Korea would be able to reach and strike the United States, as such missiles can cover a distance of more than of 5,500 kilometers, while intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBM) have a much shorter range and pose no threat to the US.

The US military identified the projectile fired by North Korea as a single, land-based, intermediate range ballistic missile. American military data indicates that it flew some 930 kilometers in 37 minutes before falling into the Sea of Japan.

US President Donald Trump mocked North Korea’s latest missile test immediately after the launch, suggesting that the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, doesn’t have “anything better to do with his life” than fire off missiles.

North Korea has just launched another missile. Does this guy have anything better to do with his life? Hard to believe that South Korea….. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 4, 2017

Trump also urged China to exert more pressure on the North and “end this nonsense once and for all.” Meanwhile, Beijing called for calm and restraint from all sides, while condemning North Korea’s latest test, which violated UN Security Council resolutions.

The Election Integrity Project (EIP), a California-based volunteer organization that aims to increase transparency in the voting process, has slammed a decision by California Secretary of State Alex Padilla to refuse to cooperate with President Donald Trump’s Commission on Election Integrity in its efforts to investigate claims of voter fraud.

In a statement, the EIP said (original emphasis):

California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, along 25+ other Secretaries of State (SOS) has refused to cooperate with the bipartisan President’s Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. He was asked to simply supply the state’s voter list to the Commission so it can investigate practices that could lead to improper or fraudulent registrations and voting. The requested information is, for the most part, public information, and no more than any candidate, education organization, research organization, among others, are privy to. …

Secretary Padilla states that he does not want to “legitimize already debunked claims of massive voter fraud.” California’s Election Integrity Project (EIP) asks not only when, where and how did the “debunking” take place, but more importantly, why protest an opportunity to conclusively prove through third party investigation his assertion that there is no election fraud in California? What does the Secretary have to hide?

Over the past 20 years, European cities have slowly become more ethnically diverse, as EU governments open their borders to foreign populations.

And as this process has taken place, the authorities have been quick to cover up any crimes that have been committed by these populations. For instance, Swedish police are no longer allowed to describe the ethnic background of the criminals they catch, and most notably, the German government and press were desperate to cover up hundreds sexual assaults that occurred in Cologne in 2015.

However, there are certain statistics that can’t be covered up. A government can try to conceal the connection between crimes and specific ethnic groups, but they can’t cover up the overall crime statistics of an entire city. Plus, politically correct governments can’t really hide the ethnic diversity of their cities. That’s something that their progressive sensibilities command them to promote.

Fortunately, sometimes those two factors come together to give us all a good look at the relationship between immigration and crime in Europe, despite the best efforts of European governments to conceal that connection. For example, the German government recently revealed that more than half of the population of Frankfurt has a foreign background, arguably making it the most diverse major city in Germany.

For the first time, more than half of Frankfurt residents now have a migrant background, according to official data from the city’s Office of Statistics and Elections. Presenting the figures, which show that 51.2 per cent of people living in Frankfurt have a migrant background, the city’s secretary of integration Sylvia Weber said: “We have minorities with relatively large numbers in Frankfurt but no group with a clear majority.” Representing 13 per cent of the population, Turks are the city’s largest non-German minority, and 61 per cent of residents who were born abroad are citizens of other European Union (EU) countries.

And on top of that, the data reveals that these people aren’t thriving in Germany. 49% of people with foreign backgrounds in Frankfurt live below the poverty line, compared to 23% of native Germans, and they are significantly more likely to be unemployed. But that’s not the real kicker. Frankfurt was a diverse city long before the migrant crisis reached its peak, and even then it had a startling crime rate.

The 2013 national crime figures, which were leaked to Welt newspaper earlier this week, show just under six million crimes were recorded in Germany last year. When broken down to the number of crimes per 100,000 inhabitants, Frankfurt am Main rates as the most dangerous city in Germany with 16,292 crimes per 100,000 people. Its high ranking was put down to its red light district and the large airport.

Of course if you brought this fact up to most leftists, they would call you a racist. But it has nothing to do with race. The real problem is that Germany hasn’t properly vetted their immigrants, nor have they successfully assimilated them. Germany is inviting people into their country who have no respect for German law, and they aren’t pressuring them to join German culture. And the result is rather predictable. Germany has a large foreign population that is young, jobless, alienated from mainstream culture, and more likely to commit crimes.

What we’re seeing in Frankfurt is the future of Europe, if EU nations continue to celebrate multiculturalism and leave their borders wide open. It will be a divided continent, filled with ethnic enclaves, no-go zones, civil unrest, and crime. If they don’t see the folly of multiculturalism, within a generation every city in Europe will be like Frankfurt, or perhaps even worse.

The University of California, Berkeley is trying to dismiss a free speech lawsuit filed following the cancellation of Ann Coulter’s speech at the school in April.

UC Berkeley attorneys—including Janet Napolitano, system president of the University of California, and Nicholas Dirks, chancellor of UC Berkeley—insist the claims made by Young America’s Foundation and the Berkeley College Republicans are “moot,” according to a court document obtained by Campus Reform Friday.

“The alleged restrictions were viewpoint neutral because they were not motivated by disagreement with the speaker’s viewpoint,” said the attorneys.

The attorneys assert that the cancellation Coulter’s speech had nothing to do with the author’s political views, arguing that there were instead “constitutional ‘time, place, and, manner regulations’” which restricted her speech.

“This weak attempt by the University of California, Berkeley to brush off their egregious free speech violations is staggering but unfortunately unsurprising given their demonstrated pattern of suppressing the First Amendment rights of conservatives on campus,” said Spencer Brown, spokesman for Young America’s Foundation. “As Young America’s Foundation has done throughout the last half-century, YAF will continue to stand up for students’ rights when their own schools engage in flagrant obstruction of free expression.”

Dan Mogulof, an assistant vice chancellor at Berkeley, said in a statement to The Daily Caller News Foundation that recent events at UC Berkeley have shown there is “insufficient awareness” as to the school’s speaker policies. He also acknowledged that policies currently in place “should be unified, standardized, and clarified.”

“Statements reasserting and emphasizing our existing policies and practices that make clear speaker viewpoints will not influence decisions relating to event approval or required security measures” will be added to the policy, according to Mogulof, a statement that suggests UC Berkeley administrators believe the school never did discriminate based on the political viewpoint of potential speakers.

“[UC Berkeley police] place the safety and well-being of our students as the lead priority which can, at rare times, lead the department to forego short-term arrests,” said Mogulof, denying the “stand down policy” that observers suspected the police to have.

“These decisions are made on a case-by-case basis by command staff based on their professional assessment, and suffice it to say there is nothing precluding them form effecting arrests if they believe that can be done with creating serious risk and danger for innocent bystanders and/or those who elect to engage in lawful protest.”

The assistant vice chancellor noted that while a new draft policy for campus speakers is not yet available for public consumption, the school intends to implement an interim policy by Aug. 13 before the start of the fall semester.

Berkeley has been the site of several protests and altercations between Donald Trump supporters and antifascists in 2017, including the riot that canceled conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos’ February speech, a March 4 Trump conflict, and a Patriots Day rally skirmish in April.

The Daily Caller News Foundation reached out to UC Berkeley for comment, but received none in time for press.

During their “extensive discussion,” Trump and the German leader “addressed climate issues, the Women’s Entrepreneurship Financing Initiative, and trade, including global steel overcapacity.”

Their phone call comes after Reuters reported earlier in the day that the German election program produced by chancellor’s party does not refer to the United States as a “friend.”

The president is expected to meet Merkel this week before the summit, according to Reuters.

The Department of Justice asked a federal judge in Hawaii to deny the state’s request for clarification on President Trump’s travel ban Monday, saying any order limiting the scope of the travel restrictions should be considered by the Supreme Court.

Hawaii is challenging the administration’s enforcement of the ban, which finally went into effect on Thursday after being bogged down by legal challenges for months.

Visa applicants from specific countries must now prove a “bonda fide” familial relationship to be accepted. The state argues that the White House interpreted the definition of close family members too narrowly.

In a filing Monday responding to Hawaii’s challenge, the administration said its definition of “close family member” is consistent with the Immigration and Nationality Act, Bloomberg reported.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC), in charge of making the rules for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in South Korea, said that there will be no sex or gender testing required for the upcoming games.

“With regard to Hyperandrogenism in female athletes, there were no regulations in place at the Olympic Games Rio 2016 and there will be no regulations in place at the Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018 as we are still awaiting the resolution of the Dutee Chand case,” the IOC wrote in a June email in response to an inquiry into how it would regulate the upcoming Olympics.

The response follows controversy that sparked after 800-meter South African runner Caster Semenya won gold at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil. Semenya’s intersex condition causes her to produce more testosterone (hyperandrogenism) than most women, prompting questions about whether she had an unfair biological advantage.

“These kind of people should not run with us,” Italian middle-distance runner Elisa Cusma said. “For me, she is not a woman. She is a man.”

In the past, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the world’s governing body for track and field, sought to preserve the male-female division by administering gynecological exams, chromosome tests, or hormone tests to ensure fair competition.

Before the Rio Olympics, women like Semenya whose functional levels of the hormone are higher than 10 nmols/L were barred from international competition. Between 2011 and 2015, the IAAF ruled that any woman with less than 10 nanomoles of testosterone per liter of blood could compete in women’s events. Sex testing was not required of any athletes at the Rio Olympics, however, meaning intersex track athletes could compete with their natural testosterone levels.

Prior to IAFF regulations, Semenya dominated the 800m race at the world championships in Berlin, but she failed to move beyond the semifinals in Beijing after testosterone limits were implemented. When the testosterone rule was suspended in 2015, she returned to form, winning the 400m, 800m, and 1500m races at the African Championships — all on the same day — and an olympic gold the following year.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport suspended the IAAF’s testosterone rule in 2014, citing a lack scientific evidence to suggest that women with high levels of the hormone have a significant competitive advantage. The IAAF argued that testosterone is the most important boost to athletic performance, but the court stated that unless it could prove an average performance gap of 10 to 12 percent between male and female runners, there was not sufficient “evidence about the degree of the advantage.”

This decision came after an Indian sprinter named Dutee Chand said the federation unfairly discriminated against women like her with higher testosterone levels. The IAAF rebuked the court’s decision, pointing to two large studies in Russia and South Korea showing that most elite female athletes had testosterone levels between 0.1 and 3.08 nmol/L and that 99 percent of female athletes had testosterone below 3.08 nmol/L. They argued the 10 nmol/L cap for women was “too generous.”

The court gave the IAAF a deadline of July 2017 to come up with more evidence otherwise the rule barring competition would be permanently void.

In February, the International Olympics Committee agreed to stop regulating women’s natural testosterone levels until the IAAF case was resolved.

Testosterone, found in both men and women has been linked with increased muscle, bone mass, and competitive drive. The average male produces much more of it than the average female, roughly 35 nmol/L. Women usually produce less than 3 nmol/L.

Sweden-based Professor Martin Ritzén, a specialist in pediatric endocrinology, testified on behalf of the IAAF and said the probability of a healthy woman reaching 10 nmol/L of testosterone was “zero.” Another IAAF expert witness, professor of gynecology Angelica Hirschberg, noted that she had never seen such a high level of the hormone in someone with healthy ovaries and normal adrenal glands.

IAAF argued that transgender and intersex athletes have an unfair advantage in part because testosterone is linked with lean body mass, increased strength, speed, and power. This is why many athletes try to illegally take synthetic versions of the hormone to boost their performance, the IAAF contended.

Joanna Harper, a doctor and transgender woman who competed in male distance running events for decades, told the Court of Arbitration that when she started taking a testosterone blocker and estrogen as part of her transition, she became “noticeably slower.” Harper collated data from seven other transgender runners for a study published in the “Journal of Sporting Cultures and Identities” and found that all of them had slower times competing as females.

Other experts question whether it’s fair to equate the experience of transgender women with the experience of intersex women. They argue that the two different populations cannot be compared and that a runner’s performance may take a hit from the psychological toll of being outed to the world as intersex.

The IOC Medical Commission held a consensus meeting in 2010 on female hyperandrogenism and implemented the IOC Regulations on Female Hyperandrogenism prior to the 2012 London Olympic Games, according to the IOC’s email. The regulations were published in September 2013 and updated for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games.

“In November 2015, the IOC Medical and Scientific Commission convened an expert group to review the available scientific and clinical evidence on Sex Reassignment and Hyperandrogenism in female athletes. Although there was not unanimity of opinion on all details discussed the statement reflects a consensus (Consensus Statement) of those participating. However, following the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) interim award in the Chand v AFI and IAAF case, the IOC was not in a position to introduce rules on hyperandrogenism until the issues of the case are resolved,” the email concluded.

Unless the Olympic Committee changes its mind before 2018, athletes competing in the South Korea Winter Olympics will not be required to undergo sex testing or adhere to testosterone limits.

Three car bombs exploded in Damascus on Sunday, state media said, killing at least seven people in the first suicide bombings in the Syrian capital since jihadists attacked in March.

Security forces stopped the terrorists from reaching their targets which would have led to more deaths, officials told state TV, saying the bombers had aimed to hit busy areas on the first day back to work after the Eid al-Fitr holiday.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Damascus was hit by two separate, multiple suicide bomb attacks in March, one of them claimed by the ISIS terrorist group and the other by the Islamic insurgent alliance Tahrir al-Sham.

ISIS terrorists were battling to hold on to the last few streets under their control in the Old City of Mosul on Monday, in what looked like a hopeless last stand in their former stronghold.

In fierce fighting, Iraqi army units forced the insurgents back, cornering them in a shrinking rectangle no more than 300 meters (yards) wide and 500 meters long by the Tigris river, according to a map published by the military media office.

Smoke covered parts of the Old City, rocked by air strikes and artillery salvos through the morning.

The number of ISIS terrorists fighting in Mosul has dwindled from thousands at the start of the government offensive more than eight months ago to a mere couple of hundred now, according to the Iraqi military.

President Donald Trump plans to focus on Syria during his meeting this week with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit.

Although an official outline for the discussion has not yet been released, administration officials say Trump will bring up the ongoing conflict and question Putin’s support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

The meeting, set to take place on the sidelines in Hamburg, Germany, was confirmed last week by national security adviser H.R. McMaster.

Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov responded to reports of Trump’s intended focus Monday by calling the topic “reasonable.”

“I’ve heard the Americans want to raise the issues of terrorism and Syria,” he said. “It seems to me that would be pretty reasonable.”

Ushakov asserted that Putin intends to request that the United States return two diplomatic compounds seized as part of the Obama administration’s sanctions over alleged election meddling. The Kremlin aide, who also discussed the 35 expelled Russian diplomats, stated that such a move by the White House would save Russia “from the need to retaliate.”

“We have a lot of issues, which should be discussed at the highest level…” Ushakov added. “That’s why this meeting, this first personal contact, is so important.”

Relations between the two countries remain strained following the US missile strike against a Syrian airbase in April accused of facilitating a chemical weapons attack.

While the White House and Kremlin have signaled a desire for détente, conflicting agendas have thus far stalled such attempts.

An analysis of White House salary data reveals that President Donald Trump’s administration is spending $5 million less of taxpayer money on his staff than his predecessor.

Trump employs 377 people at the White House, with a total of $35.8 million, while former President Barack Obama paid $40.9 million for 476 employees in 2015, according to data analyzed by Open the Books.

Another key difference between the Obama and Trump White House is the first lady’s staff. Michelle Obama retained 24 staffers in the first year of the Obama White House. Melania Trump currently employs four—a chief of staff who is also listed as adviser to the president, a deputy chief of staff, a communications director, and a scheduler.

“Projected four-year savings on the White House payroll could top $22 million,” Adam Andrzejewski, CEO of Open the Books, writes for Forbes. Those projected savings include Trump’s promise to accept $1 in salary and give the remainder back to the U.S. Treasury.

Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, both advisers to the president, are not accepting any salary. Most top White House staff—including Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, Omarosa Manigault, Reince Priebus, Sean Spicer, and 17 others—make $179,000 annually.

Obama had the same number of top advisers at this stage of his presidency in 2009, but he also appointed many “czars” to oversee special initiatives with a particular focus on recovery efforts after the 2008 financial crisis. Trump has not continued that

While $22 million in savings is a tiny amount compared to the nearly $20 trillion national debt or the $3.9 trillion federal budget, “it could be a leading indicator of Trump’s commitment to cut waste, fraud and taxpayer abuse,” Andrzejewski said.

“Amid significant uncertainty surrounding the future direction of U.S. health care policy, Premier Health Plan will join several other health insurers in exiting the federal health insurance exchange in Ohio by discontinuing its Premier HealthOne On-Exchange plan at the end of 2017,” the company said.

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, Ohio had 10 insurers operating at the beginning of 2017. Premier Health Plan is the second health insurer to exit, after Anthem announced earlier this month they were leaving the exchanges.

“The uncertainty in Washington, D.C., around the future of the Affordable Care Act—through which the federal exchange was created—and the associated volatility in the marketplace have led us to conclude that we cannot effectively plan and price affordable health insurance to sell on the exchange,” Renee George, president of Premier Health Plan, said in a statement.

U.K. hospitals violated British data privacy laws in a deal with Google’s artificial intelligence company, DeepMind, a privacy watchdog ruled Monday.

After a yearlong investigation, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) said that the Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust, which is composed of three London hospitals, has been asked to restructure its data-sharing practices to comply with the law.

According to the ICO, the hospital group violated the U.K.’s Data Protection Act when it turned over the health information of 1.6 million patients to DeepMind, which is owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet.

“We accept the ICO’s findings and have already made good progress to address the areas where they have concerns,” the Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust said in a statement. “For example, we are now doing much more to keep our patients informed about how their data is used. We would like to reassure patients that their information has been in our control at all times and has never been used for anything other than delivering patient care or ensuring their safety.”

What’s the secret to healthy eating? Less carbs? More fat? Less sugar? Unfortunately, research doesn’t provide clear answers, so it’s wise to be wary of anyone claiming to have a silver bullet. Despite the best of intentions, even if the federal government wanted to improve health through better eating habits, they can’t because they start with bad information.

While they try to associate diets with diseases like obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, they can’t because the dietary information comes from an unreliable source: the people consuming food. Stated simply, no one really knows what Americans are eating because the government’s method for collecting dietary information is to simply ask people what they remember eating in the past.

Memory and recall have long been considered woefully inadequate for scientific data collection. Yet this is what government relies on when providing advice on healthy eating. The government’s main dietary advice is the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA), which was first released in 1980 and is now updated every five years.

The news for the news media keeps getting worse.

A new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll out Monday shows that while the public has low trust in the Trump administration, they trust the media even less.

Just 30 percent of Americans said they have a “great deal” or “good amount” of trust in the news media, the poll shows. That’s lower than the 37 percent of Americans who said the same about the Trump administration. The poll found that 37 percent of adults said they trust the media “not at all,” while another 31 percent said they have “not very much” trust in the news media.

Democrats trust the media far more than either Republicans or independents, the poll shows. While 56 percent of Democrats said they have a “great deal” or “good amount” of trust in the news media, just 28 percent of independents and nine percent of Republicans said the same.

Organizers of Sweden’s largest music festival have canceled the 2018 event after failing to stop sexual assaults.

More than 50,000 people visit the Bråvalla Festival each year. Organizers stepped up their efforts against violence after five rapes and 14 cases of sexual assault were reported in 2016.

With three rapes and 22 sexual assaults reported by the festival’s conclusion Saturday night, the festival’s founder said he can no longer allow the festival to go on.

“I’ve had enough. Violence kills the festival experience, the love for music and, beyond anything else, it hurts people,” Folkert Koopmans, the founder of Bråvalla Festival, said in a press release.

The festival further said the decision should be seen as a clear remark that sexual violence can’t be tolerated.

“It’s not that we can’t handle the problem or that the problem only exists at festivals, it’s about taking a stand,” Kajsa Apelqvist, the festival’s head of communications told Aftonbladet.

Prime Minister Stefan Lofven called for a wider effort to stop sexual assaults at festivals and concerts.

“I get so upset and we need to stop this,” Lofven said Sunday. “We’re demanding police get better at solving these types of crimes. We’re also looking at ways to increase video surveillance.”

British band Mumford & Sons vowed to boycott the festival after being one of the headliners in 2016.

“We won’t play at this festival again until we’ve had assurances from the police and organizers that they’re doing something to combat what appears to be a disgustingly high rate of reported sexual violence,” the band said on its Facebook page after the 2016 festival.

65% of Trump supporters would back a military strike on North Korea, according to a new poll.

The Twitter poll, which received almost 30,000 votes, asked “If Trump launched a military strike on North Korea, would you support it?”

Just 35% of respondents said they would oppose military action.

The numbers that would back a military strike seem significantly higher than those who supported aggression against Syria following April’s cruise missile strike, an event that split Trump’s base.

During a speech in front of the United Nations, Ambassador Nikki Haley warned that sanctions wouldn’t be enough to stop Kim Jong-Un’s dictatorship and that the U.S. was prepared to use “our considerable military forces”.

“Time is short. Action is required. The world is on notice,” she said.

According to the Pentagon, North Korea’s July 4 missile launch was a new type “we have not seen before”.

Most authorities on the issue agree that Pyongyang launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching Alaska, but not the U.S. mainland.

After the launch, North Korea claimed it was, “a full-fledged nuclear power that has been possessed of the most powerful inter-continental ballistic rocket capable of hitting any part of the world”.

San Antonio Police Chief William McManus appeared on “Fox and Friends” Wednesday to discuss anti-police rhetoric after NYPD officer Miosotis Familia was gunned down while sitting in her patrol car.

NBC New York said the shooter was a 34-year-old ex-convict from the Bronx named Alexander Bonds.

The gunman who ambushed and shot an NYPD officer sitting inside her mobile command vehicle Wednesday morning, killing her, was a 34-year-old ex-convict out on parole for robbery, officials say. A motive in the shooting is still not clear, but Alexander Bonds of the Bronx, who also went by the name John Bonds, once ranted online about his treatment in prison and about police getting away with killing people. He had also expressed an anti-government sentiment in online posts, according to a law enforcement official.

San Antonio’s Chief McManus recently dealt with a similar situation to the shooting of Familia when two of his officers were shot at an event he described as “the most unprovoked attack I have ever seen.”

McManus said, “I’m angry at the police haters, I’m sick of the police haters. We protect them. We defend them. And they give us a big F U. And I’m sick of it.”

North Korea test launched Tuesday an intercontinental ballistic missile that may be capable of reaching Alaska.

The projectile, known as the Hwasong-14, was said to have reached an altitude of 2,802 kilometers (1,741 miles) before flying 933 kilometers (579 miles).

The launch is being described by experts as a “game-changer” that further limits the already scant and risky options available to the Trump administration for dealing with Pyongyang.

According to the Korean Central News Agency, North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un described the ICBM as “a gift” to “American bastards.” The news agency also claimed the missile is capable of carrying a “large, heavy nuclear warhead.”

The United Nations Security Council is expected to issue a stern condemnation of the launch after an emergency meeting scheduled Wednesday.

South Korea and the United States responded to the ICBM test by conducting a joint ballistic-missile drill of its own.

The following images were released by North Korean media outlet Rodong Sinmun:

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Evidence emerging from the Vatican in recent days strongly suggests Pope Francis is transforming the Catholic Church into a socialist political organization that embraces the LGBT agenda, in complete rejection of the traditional pro-family religious orientation of his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI.

Last week, Pope Francis fired the Vatican’s top theologian, Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Mueller, the head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, who had a reputation as a staunch defender of the traditional family.

Pope Francis replaced Cardinal Mueller with the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith’s second-in-command, the more liberal Archbishop Luis Francisco Ladaria Ferrer.

Then, on Thursday, July 5, the Daily Mail in London reported Vatican police had broken up a gay orgy occurring in the Vatican-owned apartment belonging to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.

Ironically, this was also the Vatican department Pope Francis had assigned to investigate the Catholic Church’s pedophile sex scandal involving priests in the United States as well as various other countries around the world.

The apartment was apparently the residence of the male secretary to Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio, one of Pope Francis’ key advisors, and the president of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, another key part of the Roman Curia responsible for administering the activities of the Catholic Church worldwide.

Neither development surprised reporter George Neumayr, whose recent book, The Political Pope: How Pope Francis is Delighting the Liberal Left and Abandoning Conservatives, predicted Pope Francis will accelerate the transformation of the Catholic Church into a leftist political organization after former Pope Benedict XVI dies.

“Pope Francis inherited Cardinal Muller from his predecessor and was itching to sack him,” Neumayr explained to Infowars.com in an email.

“Pope Francis was annoyed by Muller’s opposition to the relativism of this pontificate, particularly Muller’s resistance to the pope’s plan to relax the Church’s teaching on adultery,” Neumayr continued.

“Muller also opposed the pope’s policy of distributing Communion to divorced-and-remarried Catholics,” Neumayr added.

Neumayr interpreted the move as Pope Francis distancing himself from the more conservative, traditional papacy of Pope Benedict XVI.

“By dropping Muller, Pope Francis is trying to free himself for once and all from the conservative restraints of Pope Benedict XVI, whose opposition to the ‘dictatorship of relativism’ Pope Francis always disliked,” Neumayr explained.

“Appropriately, Pope Francis has replaced Muller with a fellow Jesuit, the Spanish archbishop Luis Ladaria Ferrer, who appears willing to serve as a rubber stamp for the pope’s liberalism,” Neumayr concluded.

Neumayr also commented on the developing Vatican gay sex orgy scandal.

“This is proof the gay mafia has reached the highest echelons of the Catholic Church,” Neumayr told Infowars.com in an exclusive telephone interview.

“Instead of disbanding the gay mafia, Pope Francis evidently has allowed the gay mafia to burrow deeper into the Vatican.”

Neumayr referenced the decision Pope Francis made in July 2013 to appoint Monsignor Battista Ricca, a veteran Vatican diplomat, to serve as his representative, or “prelate” at the Vatican Bank despite allegations of various gay sexual scandals that plagued Ricca since 1999, when he was sent by the Vatican to Montevideo, Uruguay.

“The ecclesiastical head of the Vatican Bank is still Monsignor Ricca,” Neumayr commented, “and he was entangled in a similar gay sexual scandal before his elevation to his current position.”

Neumayr noted that Pope Francis was aware of the sexual scandal allegations made against Ricca, but Pope Francis decided to disregard the charges when he decided to go ahead and make Ricca head of Vatican Bank anyway.

“No one should be surprised by these episodes — either the firing of Cardinal Mueller or the emerging gay orgy sex scandal,” Neumayr suggested.

“Both are consistent with the direction in which Pope Francis is taking the Catholic Church,” he concluded.

According to New York Magazine and Huffington Post contributing writer Yashar Ali, Secret Service agents interviewed Kathy Griffin for over an hour on Monday to discuss the photo where she posed with Donald Trump’s bloody head in her hand.

News: Kathy Griffin has been interviewed by the Secret Service, in-person, for over an hour….investigation still not closed. — Yashar Ali (@yashar) July 3, 2017

Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) replied by tweeting that the agents could only stomach Griffin for an hour and needed to detox after.

Secret Service interviewed Kathy Griffin for 1 hr; they needed more time, but that's all they could stomach; Agents in de-tox now. — Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) July 5, 2017

Huckabee also referred to CNN as the Corleone News Network in response to their attack on an internet user who made a gif showing Trump body-slamming a man with a CNN logo for a head.

~_~

Cable network CNN identified the man allegedly responsible for creating a meme depicting US President Donald Trump body-slamming the network, an image the president shared on Twitter last week.

After the anonymous Reddit user, “HanAssholeSolo,” issued an apology, CNN graciously said it would not publicly expose the person’s identity if he agreed not to do it again – a move which many saw as blackmail.

In light of CNN’s threat to dox the anonymous Redditor, #CNNBlackmail became a top trend and the Internet naturally responded in kind with more memes depicting CNN being pulverized by President Trump.

Here are a few…

Despite claims President Donald Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton marked a resurgence in the voting power of Christians in America, a globalist publication is claiming the last election was “the death rattle of White Christian America.”

“Does Trump’s victory, then, represent the resurrection of White Christian America? The consequences of the 2016 elections are indeed sweeping,” wrote Robert Jones in an excerpt from his book “The End of White Christian America” reposted in The Atlantic.



“Republicans entered 2017 with control of both houses of Congress and the White House, and because the Republican-controlled Senate refused to consider an Obama appointee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in early 2016, Trump was able to nominate a conservative Supreme Court justice right out of the gate.”

“The evidence, however, suggests that Trump’s unlikely victory is better understood as the death rattle of White Christian America — the cultural and political edifice built primarily by white Protestant Christians — rather than as its resuscitation.”

While white evangelical Christians represented 21% of the general population at the time of the 2008 election, they comprised 26% of actual voters. In 2016, despite a decline in their proportion of the population to 17%, white evangelicals continued to represent 26% of voters – clear evidence President Trump’s warnings about the dire attacks on religious liberty resonated with evangelical voters.

“Despite the outcome of the 2016 elections, the key long-term trends indicate White Christian America’s decline is continuing unabated,” Jones suggested. “Over the last eight years, the percentage of Americans who identify as white and Christian fell 11 percentage points, and support for same-sex marriage jumped 18 percentage points.”

The campaign between Clinton and Trump presented voters two starkly contrasting views of America’s future, he added.

“Donald Trump’s campaign painted a bleak portrait of America’s present, set against a bright, if monochromatic, vision of 1950s America restored. Hillary Clinton’ campaign, by contrast, sought to replace the first African American president with the first female president and embraced the multicultural future of 2050, the year the Census Bureau originally projected the United States would become a majority nonwhite nation,” Jones claimed.

Jones, the chief executive of the Public Religion Research Institute, first made his opinions about the decline of white Christian America known in an op-ed written in the immediate aftermath of Trump’s victory.

“The waning numbers of white Christians in the country today may not have time on their side, but as the sun is slowly setting on the cultural world of white Christian America, they’ve managed, at least in this election, to rage against the dying of the light,” he wrote in The New York Times.

CNN Senior Political Analyst Ronald Brownstein recently argued both political parties represent “virtually mirror image Americas with very little overlap,” with the Democratic Party representing a coalition of voters that is “racially diverse, younger, more secular, overwhelmingly urbanized, and more rooted in the globalized, post-industrial and low-carbon economy.”

“That jagged contrast between what I have called the Democrats’ ‘Coalition of Transformation,’ which largely welcomes those changes, and the Republican ‘Coalition of Restoration,’ which largely feels unsettled or eclipsed by them, has become arguably the central fault line in American life.”

CNN host Alisyn Camerota could not contain her excitement at the fact that her network had tracked down the Reddit user who created the Trump wrestling meme, and that he has issued an apology, despite the fact that CNN is being accused of using sinister blackmail tactics, threatening to publicly identify the person.

“I thought it was remarkable that CNN found the Reddit user who created the GIF,” a clearly enthusiastic Camerota told viewers.

The anchor read out a statement of apology from the meme creator (pictured below).





“…the investigative team went back and found the guy who first created this,” she noted, adding “How often do you hear someone who creates a video, goes viral, and apologizes.”

“The reason that I think this is so notable … This is a very, full-throated, genuine honest apology,” Camerota said. “He has also asked that we not reveal his name or whereabouts, and we at CNN are honoring that because he’s apologized, and he thinks that he would then be in danger and at risk if other people knew his name. We get it. We understand that.”

Reporter Chris Cillizza said that it was a very “nice thing” that CNN “tracked him down,” while CNN host Chris Cuomo stated that the individual apologized after he was “exposed and identified.”

However, Cuomo’s assertions run in contradiction to the claims of CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski, who is accused of carrying out the blackmailing.

Kaczynski claims that the user posted an apology before he was contacted.

https://twitter.com/KFILE/status/882418323673239553

Kaczynski also claims that the ‘threat’ CNN made to dox the individual is being ‘misinterpreted’.

https://twitter.com/KFILE/status/882438606270410752

https://twitter.com/KFILE/status/882417992717537280

CNN’s Chris Cuomo also took to Twitter to slam the individual for being a ‘ faceless hater’:

is being faceless getting old? own your words with an identity. truth, faceless hater, is not about telling you what you want to hear https://t.co/VKyFkQ7eJo — Christopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) July 5, 2017

Cuomo was quickly reminded that most of CNN’s hit pieces on the President have relied on ‘anonymous sources’:

CNN reporters now going after anonymity CNN has relied on anon sources for dozens of nonsense Trump/Russia stories, incl retracted stories https://t.co/oHvWbLKhmB — Omri Ceren (@omriceren) July 5, 2017

only a fool thinks unnamed sources suggest a lack of reliability. cornerstone of good journalism. many lawmakers often ask for this https://t.co/eRXQlK7zvH — Christopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) July 5, 2017

When Americans responded to Cuomo by saying CNN’s ratings were collapsing, the reporter just dug in deeper:

collapse? where do you get this bs? cnn mornings are way up. so is joe. covering trump matters to people. #GetWoke https://t.co/SqN53I3ZRP — Christopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) July 5, 2017

The culprit behind a shocking “unprovoked attack” on a female police officer had spouted anti-cop rhetoric in the past and urged people to vote for Hillary Clinton.

Authorities are trying to piece together a motive after NYPD officer and mother of three Miosotis Familia was brutally gunned down in cold blood by Alexander Bonds early Monday morning while she sat in a temporary headquarters vehicle at East 183rd Street and Morris Avenue in Fordham Heights.

Bonds was subsequently killed by two other officers called to the scene while Familia died in hospital.

“This is absolutely an unprovoked attack,” said NYPD Commissioner James P. O’Neill. Police say surveillance footage shows Bonds pulling up his hoodie before “purposefully” walking up to the vehicle and shooting through the passenger side.

Speculation as to why 34-year-old Bonds, who had previously served seven years in prison for a Syracuse robbery, gunned down Familia has begun to center on his political beliefs.

Bonds’ Facebook page reveals that days before the presidential election, he posted a video of a woman alleging that voting machines were switching Hillary Clinton votes to Donald Trump.

“Watch out also go vote our voices matter believe that if I could I kno u would,” he wrote.

On the same day he urged people to “get mad” about the election and vote. When asked who he was voting for, Bonds responded that he couldn’t vote (due to his felony conviction), but said people should vote for Hillary Clinton.

According to the New York Daily News, Bonds, “Spoke critically of law enforcement on an unspecified social media site.”

The video below features Bonds engaged in a foul-mouthed rant against the police.

Man who murdered NYPD officer Miosotis Familia posted anti-police video on Facebook. pic.twitter.com/bqTP18XFOu — Josh Caplan (@joshdcaplan) July 5, 2017

Bonds also posted Malcolm X memes as well as videos of confrontations between black people and police officers.

Previous ambush-style murders of police officers have been motivated by extremist anti-cop ‘Black Lives Matter’-style rhetoric, as well as mass shootings of police officers like the Dallas massacre, which was celebrated by BLM sympathizers.

There has been no word yet from prominent ‘Black Lives Matter’ personalities about the killing of Miosotis Familia.

CNN’s terrifying decision to threaten to personally destroy HanAssholeSolo, the person who created the epic WWE video President Trump tweeted out last week, CNN’s chilling move to go the full-Brownshirt against some nobody goofing on the Internet, does not surprise me at all.

What is a little shocking is how open the leftwing network was about its mafia tactics. A threat, an actual threat, a warning to others, right there in print! On CNN! [emphasis added]

CNN, a multi-billion dollar, mega-media corporation will be watching the behavior of a private citizen (all of us, really) and should this person (all of us, really) ever be discovered behaving in a way that this multi-billion dollar, mega-media corporation disapproves, this multi-billion dollar, mega-corporation will ruin this person’s life (all of our lives, really) — will reveal YOUR name, will see to it that you lose your job, are harassed out of your home, and whatever other horrors CNN’s fascist SJW Army can come up with.

Newly released data from the NHS shows there were more than 5,000 new cases of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) recorded over the last year, with 120 cases involving women and girls that were born in the UK.

The practice is banned in the UK, however, many families take young girls out of the country in order to undergo the barbaric procedure. Since 1985 when it became illegal in the UK, not a single parent has been prosecuted.

Data suggests those most at risk are girls from Egypt, Gambia, Kenya and Nigeria. Around a third of all cases involves girls from Somalia.

CNN is reeling from a huge backlash after the news organization was accused of blackmailing the creator of the infamous Trump-CNN wrestling meme by threatening to reveal his identity.

The mainstream media thought it had scored a victory when it was discovered that the original creator of the meme had previously posted racist content.

However, the individual, know by his handle ‘HanAssholeSolo’, has if anything been turned into a martyr.

The controversy erupted when CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski bragged that CNN had refrained from publishing HanAssholeSolo’s real name because he had “issued an extensive statement of apology,” showed remorse and promised not to make fun of CNN again.

“CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change,” stated the article.

This led to a firestorm of fury, with even many on the left slamming CNN for its unethical, and possibly illegal, practice.

Kaczynski then attempted to claim that HanAssholeSolo had apologized before CNN contacted him, contradicting his previous tweet which stated that HanAssholeSolo’s apology “came after CNN identified and reached out to him.”

The reaction on Twitter was vitriolic as #CNNBlackmail began trending.

Wikileaks’ Julian Assange posted a number of tweets in which he documented how CNN had broken the law, as well as tweeting, “A multi-billion dollar TV network blackmailing a private citizen into not making funny videos about it is not journalism, CNN.”

CNN essentially blackmailed a private citizen because he made fun of CNN.

Let that sink in.

Should a news organization that blackmails private citizens be allowed to have White House press access?

Fresh off the back of James O’Keefe’s CNN exposé , the news network is on the ropes. It’s difficult to see how they’re going to recover from this one without huge damage to their credibility.

It also remains to be seen whether the originator of the meme, who some claim could be as young as 15-years-old (although Kaczynski denies this), will seek to launch a lawsuit against CNN.

Leftist media figures questioned whether or not President Trump was threatening them after he tweeted on Monday that “at some point” the news “will be forced to discuss our great job numbers” and “strong economy.”

From Breitbart:

Trump tweeted: “At some point the Fake News will be forced to discuss our great jobs numbers, strong economy, success with ISIS, the border & so much else!”

At some point the Fake News will be forced to discuss our great jobs numbers, strong economy, success with ISIS, the border & so much else! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2017

NBC’s Katy Tur oh-so-seriously and ominously asked on-air what Trump meant by “forced.” Talking Points Memo asked, “Trump declares the press will be “forced” to cover his achievements. What First Amendment?”

A contributor to the New York Times and New Republic wrote, “Interesting choice by Trump to use the word ‘forced’ the day after sharing his fantasy of assaulting a news network.” An NBC News editor emphasized Trump’s use of the words “will be ‘forced’ to.”

Later in the day, though he did not specifically mention or refer to the tweet, NBC’s Chuck Todd spoke generally about Trump’s “dehumanizing” tweets.

“If these actions and this language was being used by a leader in a different country, our State Department… not just we in general… would be saying ‘Hmm, that country is inching towards authoritarianism,'” Todd said. “Because that’s usually the first sign: when you try to delegitimize a free press.”

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un promised more small and big “gift packages” for “the US imperialists” while he was pleased to observe the first successful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test, according to the North’s official state media.

Lauding the DPRK’s scientists and pleased with the fact that Tuesday’s successful launch coincided with Independence Day in the US, Kim Jong-un called to “frequently send big and small ‘gift packages’ to the Yankees as ever so that they will not feel weary,” the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said, as cited by KCNA Watch on Wednesday.

The report added that Kim was “feasting his eyes” on the latest addition to the North’s arsenal before the test, calling it the final phase of “the protracted showdown with the US imperialists,” which can “demonstrate its mettle to the US which is testing its will in defiance of its warning.”

On Tuesday morning, Pyongyang claimed it had successfully launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile, Hwasong-14, which is capable of carrying a “large, heavy nuclear warhead.” The missile, which can reportedly strike the US mainland, was called “another brilliant victory of the Korean people in their struggle against the US-led imperialists.”

“The test-launch confirmed the features of the rocket’s blast-off from its launching pad and technological features of its guidance and stability system in its active-flight stages and structural system,” KCNA reported.

After the launch, Pyongyang said its Hwasong-14 ICBM flew some 933km in 39 minutes, reaching an altitude of 2,802km, according to state television.

However, there are different estimates of the range of the latest missile. The US military initially said the rocket was a land-based intermediate-range ballistic missile, which fell into the Sea of Japan (known in Korea as the East Sea) after covering more than 930km in 37 minutes.

Later in the day Washington changed its assessment, saying that Pyongyang’s rocket had a two-stage design which would allow the projectile to fly the range required to be classed as an ICBM.

Meanwhile the South Korean military confirmed that its northern neighbor tested a new ICBM, according to Yonhap.

On Tuesday, the Russian Defense Ministry stated that North Korea launched an intermediate range missile (IRBM), which flew some 535 kilometers, reaching an altitude of 510km, and fell into the Sea of Japan, according to its data.

The type of the missile determines the distance it can cover and thus whether it would be able to reach and strike the United States, which is treated as one of the top threats to North Korean security and vice versa. ICBMs can cover a distance of more than of 5,500km and can potentially hit the US, while IRBMs have a much shorter range and pose no threat.

The test launch triggered the world’s reaction, from world leaders’ statements to joint drills. On Tuesday, Moscow and Beijing called on North Korea to freeze its nuclear and missile programs, and at the same time urged the US and South Korea to abstain from holding war games in the region.

Despite the warnings, the US and South Korean militaries launched surface-to-surface tactical missiles into neutral waters, with the American side threatening to deploy and engage missile systems in case of further provocation from the North.

However, Pyongyang is apparently not planning to stop its nuclear and missile tests as long as Washington follows a “hostile policy” towards Pyongyang and poses a “nuclear threat.”

“The DPRK would neither put its nukes and ballistic rockets on the table of negotiations in any case nor flinch even an inch from the road of bolstering the nuclear force chosen by itself unless the US hostile policy and nuclear threat to the DPRK are definitely terminated,” state media KCNA said.

Over the past 20 years, European cities have slowly become more ethnically diverse, as EU governments open their borders to foreign populations.

And as this process has taken place, the authorities have been quick to cover up any crimes that have been committed by these populations. For instance, Swedish police are no longer allowed to describe the ethnic background of the criminals they catch, and most notably, the German government and press were desperate to cover up hundreds sexual assaults that occurred in Cologne in 2015.

However, there are certain statistics that can’t be covered up. A government can try to conceal the connection between crimes and specific ethnic groups, but they can’t cover up the overall crime statistics of an entire city. Plus, politically correct governments can’t really hide the ethnic diversity of their cities. That’s something that their progressive sensibilities command them to promote.

Fortunately, sometimes those two factors come together to give us all a good look at the relationship between immigration and crime in Europe, despite the best efforts of European governments to conceal that connection. For example, the German government recently revealed that more than half of the population of Frankfurt has a foreign background, arguably making it the most diverse major city in Germany.

For the first time, more than half of Frankfurt residents now have a migrant background, according to official data from the city’s Office of Statistics and Elections. Presenting the figures, which show that 51.2 per cent of people living in Frankfurt have a migrant background, the city’s secretary of integration Sylvia Weber said: “We have minorities with relatively large numbers in Frankfurt but no group with a clear majority.” Representing 13 per cent of the population, Turks are the city’s largest non-German minority, and 61 per cent of residents who were born abroad are citizens of other European Union (EU) countries.

And on top of that, the data reveals that these people aren’t thriving in Germany. 49% of people with foreign backgrounds in Frankfurt live below the poverty line, compared to 23% of native Germans, and they are significantly more likely to be unemployed. But that’s not the real kicker. Frankfurt was a diverse city long before the migrant crisis reached its peak, and even then it had a startling crime rate.

The 2013 national crime figures, which were leaked to Welt newspaper earlier this week, show just under six million crimes were recorded in Germany last year. When broken down to the number of crimes per 100,000 inhabitants, Frankfurt am Main rates as the most dangerous city in Germany with 16,292 crimes per 100,000 people. Its high ranking was put down to its red light district and the large airport.

Of course if you brought this fact up to most leftists, they would call you a racist. But it has nothing to do with race. The real problem is that Germany hasn’t properly vetted their immigrants, nor have they successfully assimilated them. Germany is inviting people into their country who have no respect for German law, and they aren’t pressuring them to join German culture. And the result is rather predictable. Germany has a large foreign population that is young, jobless, alienated from mainstream culture, and more likely to commit crimes.

What we’re seeing in Frankfurt is the future of Europe, if EU nations continue to celebrate multiculturalism and leave their borders wide open. It will be a divided continent, filled with ethnic enclaves, no-go zones, civil unrest, and crime. If they don’t see the folly of multiculturalism, within a generation every city in Europe will be like Frankfurt, or perhaps even worse.

French president Emmanuel Macron has declared he will govern France like Jupiter, the Roman king of the gods, shortly after officials told the media his thought process was “too complex” for journalists to understand.

Summoning over 900 politicians from both houses of the French parliament to a rare Congress at the palace of Louis XIV – the ‘Sun King’ – in Versailles, he threatened to overrule lawmakers with a referendum if they try to frustrate the “reforms” he wishes to impose on the legislature. Such assemblies are usually reserved for times of national crisis.

Reuters reports him as saying he desires to reign as a “Jupiterian” president – “a remote, dignified figure, like the Roman god of gods, who weighs his rare pronouncements carefully”.

Amid North Korea’s repeated missile launches, evacuation drills conducted with the participation of local residents and based on the scenario that a missile strike is imminent are being held in many places across the nation.

Such drills have already been conducted in nine prefectures, and there are more scheduled to be carried out in at least 11 prefectures.

This month, the nation’s first drill in which people will evacuate to an underground mall is scheduled to occur in Takaoka, Toyama Prefecture.

People who might face such an emergency are required to evacuate in a different way than in the event of an earthquake.

Infowars Life Survival Shield X-2 Is Now Available



Leading the way into the next generation of super high quality nascent iodine, the new Infowars Life Survival Shield X-2 is now here.



New Stronger Formula From 7,000 Feet Below The Surface



Derived from 200 million year old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface, the next level of Survival Shield is now here and much stronger than our original formula with a powerful 650 micrograms per single drop.



Experience the benefits of next level proprietary nascent iodine, developed using our Thermodynamic Pressure Sensitive High Energy Sound Pulse Nano-Emulsion Technology that allows for a highly unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives and genetically modified ingredients. We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X-2 iodine for radiation during our quality control phase.



The Top 5 Reasons You Need Nascent Iodine



Iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health and well-being.

Nascent iodine may support healthy iodine levels.

Nascent iodine may support healthy hormone levels.

Nascent iodine may be involved in maintaining healthy metabolism. Supplementing with pure nascent iodine may provide sufficient iodine so that the body does not need to absorb iodine from other, perhaps less pure, sources.



Survival Shield X-2 Quality



Survival Shield X-2 is manufactured in a state-licensed facility that meets federal regulatory standards, is cGMP/HACCP-compliant, and lab grade. Raw elemental iodine is a controlled substance both at a State and Federal level. The licensing, approvals and regulatory documentary procedures are exacting and costly.



Bound forms of iodine must first be separated, clarified and purified from other binding components or impurities into a USP-grade (United States Pharmaceutical), mono-elemental iodine as certified USP resublimated iodine crystals. In this purified crystal form, iodine is a highly reactive and toxic substance. However, when the purified USP iodine crystals are subjected to a proprietary process it becomes nano-colloidalized and transforms into a form of elemental nascent iodine, also referred to as monoatomic iodine, without the addition of iodides!



Shocking Statistics About Iodine



According to the World Health Organization's Department o f Nutrition for Health and Development, iodine deficiency is a public health problem in 54 countries.

The CDC states that iodine deficiency is one of the four major deficiency diseases in the world (Fortunately, it is the easiest to correct).

The 2013 USGS iodine commodity summary warns that there are no comparable substitutes for iodine.

Information published by UNICEF notes that iodine deficiency is the most avoidable cause of stunted physical and intellectual development.

What Are The Health Benefits Of Nascent Iodine?



Proper iodine levels may provide support for normal response to environmental and dietary toxins.

Supports thyroid health.

May support breast milk production and quality.

Why Is Survival Shield X-2 The Best Nascent Iodine Available?



Survival Shield X-2 is created from salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.



It is tested for radiation by our quality control experts before being placed for sale.



It is approximately 50% stronger than our original Survival Shield formulation.



It is a true glycerite of natural USP grade iodine

The nascen t iodine in Survival Shield X-2 is not subjected to direct heat, harsh chemicals, or alcohol.

The transformative process produces a stable product that no other brand can match!

Completely non-GMO certified.

Vegan-friendly and completely non-toxic.

It provides high elemental iodine uptake.

Contains NO inefficient iodides.

Does not sting or burn.

Bill Gates has blasted Germany’s open-door migrant policy warning European leaders they must make it more difficult for North Africans to reach the continent.

The Microsoft founder and world’s richest person said Europe will not be able to handle the huge numbers of people desperately trying to leave Africa.

This comes as Austrian tanks have moved to seal off a vital border with Italy as over 84,000 migrants from North African have reached Italian shores this year – a 19 per cent increase from last year according to the UN.

Spain is also struggling to cope with the crisis with 6,000 people arriving by boat this year and dozens drowning during the treacherous journey.

Speaking with German news outlet Welt am Sonntag newspaper, US billionaire Gates, 61, said developed nations should instead be spending more on foreign aid to treat the causes of migration.

He said: “On the one hand you want to demonstrate generosity and take in refugees.

“But the more generous you are, the more word gets around about this — which in turn motivates more people to leave Africa.

“Germany cannot possibly take in the huge number of people who are wanting to make their way to Europe.”

While the world watches in jest as Japanese residents prepare for the possibility of a confrontation with North Korea by panic buying nuclear shelters and air purifiers, we may soon realize that their efforts to desperately acquire protective gear and equipment for nuclear disaster were quite prescient.

Yesterday, North Korea successfully tested what is reportedly an ICBM (Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile) capable of striking Alaska from the Korean peninsula. Coupled with their purported advancements in nuclear technology, North Korea may now have the ability to launch devastating attacks on their southern neighbor, Japan and even the United States. And if they have not yet achieved the ability to fit a nuclear warhead on an ICBM and deliver it effectively to its target, they are inching closer by the day.

So close, in fact, that Chinese Ambassador Liu Jieyi’s recent remarks on the matter suggest that we are nearing a dangerous breaking point:

“Currently tensions are high and we certainly would like to see a de-escalation,” Liu told a news conference at UN headquarters as China takes over the Security Council presidency in July. “If tension only goes up … then sooner or later it will get out of control and the consequences would be disastrous,” he said.

Earlier this year President Trump deployed three carrier strike groups to the region, signaling the real possibility that the United States will no longer follow what Secretary of State Rex Tillerson calls a policy of “strategic patience” employed by Trump’s predecessors.

Though the threat seems to be muted by global media, China and Russia appear to be taking it very seriously, with both having reportedly deployed tens of thousands of troops and equipment to their respective borders with the North.

All of the signs suggest that military action is about to occur. And while most Americans may think that North Korea would be another Iraq, wherein the battle could be won in a matter days, the fact is that North Korea has a massive military and now, as confirmed yesterday, an ICBM capable of striking long-range targets.

Now may be a good time to imitate the Japanese by preparing for the worst, because the moment the world realizes that war is imminent there will be a run on banks and grocery stores that will likely leave shelves and ATM machines completely empty. Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the price of government recommended anti-radiation pills skyrocketed from $15 to over $200 per unit. We expect to see a similar effect in coming weeks and months for preparedness equipment like gas masks and NBC body suits as tensions on the Peninsula heat up.

War is coming. President Trump has made this very clear and North Korea does not appear to be heeding his warning. All bets will be off once the missiles start flying.

Because all three of the world’s major super powers will be involved in one way or another it is not only possible, but quite likely that things could spiral out of control very quickly.

A female New York City police officer has died after being shot in the Bronx early Wednesday in what police described as an “unprovoked attack.”

Police rushed to the scene in Fordham in the area of 183rd Street and Morris Avenue around 12:30 a.m. The officer, identified as 48-year-old Miosotis Familia, was sitting in a marked NYPD command vehicle with her partner when she was shot, Commissioner James P. O’Neill said at a Wednesday morning press conference.

O’Neill said the suspect fired through the window of the car, striking the officer in the head. Her partner immediately radioed in for assistance.

“We are conducting an extensive search for video at this time,” O’Neill said at the press conference. “Based off what we know right now, it’s clear this was an unprovoked attack on a police officer who are assigned to keep the people of this great city safe.”

NPR faced accusations of political bias Tuesday for marking the Fourth of July by tweeting out the entire Declaration of Independence.

NPR has celebrated Independence Day for 29 years by having hosts, reporters and commentators read the Declaration of Independence on-air.

But a number of Twitter users slammed NPR for tweeting it this year, interpreting the outlet’s sharing of the founding U.S. document as a call “for revolution” and a way to “condone the violence.”

While some users ripped NPR, others mocked those who disapproved:

Migrants from Central American countries are increasingly choosing to resettle in Mexico as the Trump administration’s tough immigration enforcement policies make the U.S. a less accessible destination.

For years, Mexico has largely been a waypoint for people from the so-called Northern Triangle countries — Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador — who were trying to cross into the U.S. and petition for asylum. As the U.S. has cracked down on illegal immigration at the border and tightened its rules on accepting asylum claims, those migrants are now staying put in Mexico.

As a result, Mexico’s refugee applications have risen dramatically over the last three years, reports the Associated Press. It received 3,424 applications for refugee status in 2015, and the number more than doubled to 8,794 the next year. Mexico is on track to receive even more refugee applications in 2017 — there were 5,464 applications from just January to May.

Migration experts say word of tougher immigration and asylum policies in the U.S. has made its way back to Central America, causing migrants to choose Mexico or other neighboring countries instead. Maureen Meyer, a senior associate for Mexico at the Washington Office on Latin America, says potential immigrants now realize that Mexico is a safer bet for asylum claims.

“If you look at Mexico’s definition of who can qualify for asylum, it’s much broader than the United States,” Meyer told the AP. “If you are fleeing widespread violence in your country, you may be able to qualify for asylum in Mexico, whereas in the U.S. you have to prove that you belong to very specific groups of people.”

Mexico granted refugee status to about one of every three applicants from the Northern Triangle in 2016, reports the AP. The U.S., on the other hand, denies about 80 percent of asylum claims by people from those countries, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.

Under the Obama administration, migration from the Northern Triangle to the U.S. reached unprecedented levels. In 2013, as many as 2.7 million people born in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras were living in the United States, according to a report from the Council on Foreign Relations. That was up from an estimated 1.5 million people in 2000.

Between October 2013 and July 2015, more 100,000 unaccompanied minors from the Northern Triangle arrived in the U.S. and were given expedited resettlement under an emergency Obama order to deal with the surge.

The Trump administration has taken a much less permissive stance, pressuring Mexico to accept more Central American immigrants while publicly discouraging people from making the trek northward.

“We have asked them [Northern Triangle countries] to ask their citizens to not waste the money and head north, do not get on that terribly dangerous network,” Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly told the Senate in June. “Stay where they are, because if they come here, this is no longer an illegal-alien-friendly environment.”
